While the father believes that music and his life are for salvation, the son strives for a better society. They part ways after Suryam decides to teach his father a lesson by representing the need for social awareness in a concert. Sastry hates this idea of polluting the sacredness of music by individualism and promotes another disciple ignoring Suryam. Fed up with his father's refusal to identify him, Suryam leaves home. He finds solace with Lalita and her family. Sastry, who believes in the supremacy of caste over humanity, tries to break their relationship by instigating drunkards from the village whom Suryam has sworn to reform. Suryam vows not to marry in exchange for the drunkards reforming themselves. Sastry takes a major blow when the disciple he groomed later marries his daughter and abhors him from singing Sastry's favorite raga - The Bilahari. Finally, Sastry changes his chauvinistic self, when the Indian government recognizes Suryam's efforts at social reform and the Prime Minister of India himself comes to his village to felicitate Suryam. He realizes his son's ideals and proudly addresses himself as Suryam's father rather than a great musician."

                        "200 Cigarettes (1999). The film follows various plot arcs all occurring on New Year's Eve of 1981. Monica is throwing a big New Year's bash and is desperately afraid no one will attend. Early on the only person to have arrived is her friend Hillary. As she tries to convince Hillary to stay, we learn about various other groupings of individuals who are all on their way. The film follows several characters as they spend New Year's Eve in New York City before eventually showing up at Monica's party. The characters are: Val and Stephie, teens from Ronkonkoma who get lost in the seedy Alphabet City section of the borough and wander into a punk club where they meet Dave and Tom, who have a \"package\" they need to deliver; ditsy and awkward Cindy who is on a dinner date with the paranoid Jack; Lucy and her best friend Kevin who are struggling with the sexual tension between them; Kevin's feminist ex girlfriend Ellie, who walks in on Kevin and Lucy mid-coitus in a restroom stall; a dim-witted and flirtatious bartender; competitive friends Bridget and Caitlyn who attempt to ditch Bridget's boyfriend Eric; and the eccentric cab driver who takes them all around town throughout the evening in his disco themed taxi. Eventually, all the characters find their way to the party, although in the meantime Monica has passed out after drowning her sorrows in alcohol. She wakes up the next morning to find many unrecognizable people on her floor, including Stephie who tells her what a big hit her party was. Monica is thrilled, especially when she finds out that Elvis Costello showed up. The final montage shows Polaroids of the party, narrated by the disco cabbie, mostly featuring the unlikely romances from the party and the unconscious Monica being propped up by her party guests."

After attending a mindless party full of shallow discussions in Paris, he feels a need to escape and decides to run away with his baby-sitter, an ex-girlfriend, Marianne Renoir, leaving his wife and children and bourgeois lifestyle. Following Marianne into her apartment and finding a corpse, Ferdinand soon discovers that Marianne is being chased by OAS gangsters, two of whom they barely escape. Pierrot, and Marianne go on a traveling crime spree from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea in the dead man's car. They lead an unorthodox life, always on the run. Settling down in the French Riviera after having burnt the dead man's car and sunk a second car into the Mediterranean Sea, their relationship becomes strained. Ferdinand ends up reading books, philosophizing and writing in his diary. Marianne becomes bored of the Robert Louis Stevenson-ness of their living situation and insists they return to town, where in a night-club they meet one of their pursuers. The gangsters waterboard Ferdinand and depart. In the confusion, Marianne and Ferdinand are separated, with Marianne traveling in search of Ferdinand and Ferdinand settling in Toulon. After their eventual reunion, Marianne uses Ferdinand to get a suitcase full of money before running away with her real boyfriend, to whom she had previously referred as her brother. Pierrot shoots Marianne and her boyfriend, and, in the climactic scene, paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up by tying sticks of red and yellow dynamite to his head. Regretting his decision at the last second, he tries to extinguish the fuse, but, due to the dynamite obstructing his vision, fails and is blown up."

Just before his first performance, his act is shut down by capricious manager Ormond, who wants Gallico's brilliant buzzsaw effect for the act of the Great Rinaldi (John Emery, an established star. With this defeat, and the humiliation of having already lost his wife Claire to his rival, Gallico goes insane and uses the buzzsaw to decapitate his manager. His crime is almost revealed when Ormond's severed head is mistakenly taken for a trip with Gallico's assistant Karen (Mary Murphy and her boyfriend Alan Bruce (Patrick O'Neal, a police officer.

Gallico begins impersonating Rinaldi to take over that magician's show. Meanwhile, the detective Alan Bruce matches the fingerprints of Ormond with those of Rinaldi-since both sets of prints are actually Gallico's, and the novelist Prentiss realizes her boarder, and the murderer, was Gallico and not Ormond.

                        "Khumba (2013). A half-striped zebra is born into an insular, isolated herd obsessed with stripes. Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and, before long, he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. When even his father, the leader of the herd, blames him for the lack of rain and the subsequent death of his mother, the outcast zebra leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd without all his stripes. Khumba ventures beyond the fence - vulnerable to the ferocious Leopard, Phango, who controls the waterholes and terrorizes the animals in the Great Karoo. Khumba is rescued from an opportunistic wild dog by a quirky duo: a wildebeest and an ostrich. Mama V is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest. Ironically, she mothers Bradley, a flamboyant but insecure ostrich who overcompensates for his scraggily feathers. When a mystical mantis appears to the foal, drawing a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes, the duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over. On their journey, Khumba encounters a colorful range of characters including a migrating herd of Springbok in search of greener pastures; a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of a luxurious national park; an endangered Riverine Rabbit who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing; a group of hysterical Dassies who fanatically worship the Mighty Black Eagle and Nora, a loony, solitary Merino sheep living on an abandoned farm. Through these interactions, Khumba begins to learn that diversity is essential for survival and that one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength."

Now a successful and wealthy architect, Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna Wallace fly their white Mercedes 230SL roadster to Northern France, in order to continue driving to Saint-Tropez to celebrate the completion of a building project for a client, Maurice. Tensions between the couple are evident, and as they journey south they both remember and discuss several past journeys along the same road. The earliest memory involves how they first met on a ferry crossing when Mark was travelling alone and Joanna was part of a girl's choir.

When the other girls get chickenpox, Joanna and Mark unexpectedly wind up hitchhiking south together.

At this point Mark and Joanna decide to travel alone. Next the pair drive a new MG which begins to have exhaust troubles, finally catching on fire. On this journey Joanna announces that she is pregnant. They also meet the wealthy Maurice Dalbret (Claude Dauphin and his wife Françoise. Maurice becomes a generous but demanding client for Mark. The next story shows them travelling with their young daughter Caroline. Another time shows Mark travelling alone and having a fling with another motorist, but which is shown to be fleeting and unserious in nature. Later Joanna has an affair with Françoise's brother David, which is portrayed as much more serious than Mark's and threatens to end the marriage; however, while Joanna dines with David and they witness a couple eating together without saying a word, David asks, offhandedly, \"What kind of people can eat an entire meal together and not talk?\" Joanna replies, enthusiastically, \"Married people!\" and, realizing she misses Mark despite their faded passion, runs back to him. At the end of the film, the Wallaces manage to end their long-term relationship to Maurice and find a new client in Rome. They honestly analyse their fears and insecurities which have plagued them throughout the film. Finally, they cross the border from France into Italy.

He goes to see the last family the man was supposed to interview, the nutty, gun-toting Fleagles. The matriarch of the clan, Mamie Fleagle Smithers Johnson, insists he pretend to be the boyfriend of jailed Bonnie Fleagle in order to gain the confidence of her dying grandmother. Grandma Fleagle has hidden $70,000 stolen by Bonnie and her now-executed father, but refuses to divulge where to her unwanted relations for a very good reason: she tells Pete that she has been poisoned by them. Before she dies, she teaches Pete a nonsensical song. The Fleagles are sure Grandma told Pete where the money is hidden and keep him captive. Then, a woman claiming to be Bonnie shows up, also looking for the loot. When she gets Pete alone for questioning, she reveals she is actually Claire Matthews. Her innocent father was maliciously implicated by Bonnie's father in the bank robbery. Pete wants to escape, now that they are alone, but Claire insists on staying. If she can retrieve the money, she can exonerate her father. The Fleagles try to poison Claire at dinner, but Pete accidentally discovers that all but one of their plates have been poisoned; only the dish in front of Mamie's third husband, Mr. Johnson, is safe to eat. Johnson slips away, but is soon found glowing and dead. The uneasy situation is further complicated when the real Bonnie Fleagle breaks out of prison and comes for her money. She makes Pete sing the song and understands the seemingly meaningless lyrics. Pete gets away, and deciphers the clues hidden in the words, from which Claire finds a key to the safety deposit box. Soon, all of the Fleagles, including Mr. Johnson, are chasing Pete and Claire through the various secret passageways of the house. Fortunately, the plucky pair are able to drop each of their pursuers into a hay baling machine, from which they emerge safely secured."

The finale of Faber and Ebinger kissing illustrates one of Brecht's first uses of the mock-romantic \"happy ending\" that would become a signature of Brecht's work throughout the years of the Weimar Republic.For a detailed account of the plot of the film, as well as its creation, see \"A Brecht-Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop\", W.

The film revolves around a festival of mayordomía in the provinces, or something on the idea of \"king for a day.\" When the town celebrates the feast day of its patron saint, the church appoints a layman as \"mayordomo\" or steward, an honor that in effect is gained by being able to organize and cover the high costs of most of the saint's local festivities.

Obsessed with earning the respect which is denied to him by his peers as a result of his behavior, Trujano aims to be mayordomo in the annual festival and begins to do everything he can to get the needed money. After his eldest daughter is impregnated out of wedlock by the son of the local land baron, Trujano sells the baby to the land baron in exchange for a small fortune that makes him eligible to be appointed mayordomo.
