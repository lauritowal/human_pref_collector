        "**Title: Rethinking Borders through Transdisciplinary Cartography**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe complexities of contemporary borders necessitate innovative approaches to understanding and representing these dynamic spaces. This grant proposal outlines a transdisciplinary research program aimed at developing a digital atlas, Topological Atlas, to map, analyze, and intervene in border areas. By leveraging digital technologies and a participatory methodology, this project seeks to produce visual counter-geographies that challenge traditional cartographic norms and provide a more nuanced understanding of border spaces.\n\nFocusing on the experiences of individuals at the margins of geopolitical inquiry, this research program employs topology as a conceptual framework and methodology to create maps that reveal the interconnected relationships between migrants, security apparatuses, and border landscapes. By disrupting the dominant top-down perspectives in international relations and security studies, this project proposes a new model for researching border areas that prioritizes co-produced knowledge and acknowledges the intertwined relationship between academic inquiry and its practical applications.\n\nThe central research question guiding this project is: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experiences of those who encounter them? By addressing this question, the Topological Atlas project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of border complexities and provide innovative tools for analyzing and intervening in these critical spaces."

They have been variously conceptualised as porous, shifting and solidified. Where a border may be open for some, for others it is an impenetrable wall. Combined with the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations that operate beyond legal frameworks, such as the formation of ISIS and the situation in Europe where borders are being opened and closed against agreed treaties, the very concept of the border is being radically questioned. We need new ways to make sense of these increasingly complex spaces. This proposal aims to develop a transdisciplinary research programme for mapping, analysing and intervening in border areas in the form of a digital atlas. Topological Atlas is developed as a methodology for producing visual counter-geographies at border sites. It is ground breaking in its use of digital technologies combined with a participative approach that attends to those who are at the margins of traditional geopolitical inquiry. The project uses topology as conceptual framework and methodology to make maps that produce ‘seamless transitions’ from the space of the migrant to that of the security apparatus that creates barriers to her movement. In doing so it seeks to disrupt the cartographic norms that are being reinforced through the prevalence of GIS technology and mapping platforms such as Google Earth. It investigates forms of visual and co-produced research adapted to situations of crisis and proposes a new model for researching border areas beyond the current top-down international relations or security perspective. At the same time it acknowledges the intertwined relationship between the practice of academic inquiry, the knowledge it produces and what such knowledge can do. The project is organised around the following research question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?",
