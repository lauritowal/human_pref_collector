        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the emergence of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties through the lens of the colonial conquest of Latin America. By treating the early years of Spanish colonization as a natural experiment, this study seeks to overcome methodological limitations present in existing literature. \n\nThe initial phase of colonization offers a unique analytical advantage, as the conquerors' lack of prior knowledge about the territories they sought to conquer minimizes potential confounding factors. Furthermore, focusing on a single colonial power, Spain, allows for control over differences in legal origins. \n\nA wealth of historical data from the Archivo de Indias, including contracts (\"Capitulaciones\") and other documents, provides detailed insights into the early institutions and rules governing power, taxation, military use, and treatment of indigenous populations. Additionally, these records enable the precise localization of initial settlements at the subnational level, offering a rare opportunity for nuanced analysis.\n\nThis research aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on the origins of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties by leveraging the unique features of the colonial conquest of Latin America. The proposed study will shed new light on these critical questions, providing a deeper understanding of the historical factors that shaped the development of these institutions."

Much of the recent work on comparative politics and development uses large historical events as fruitful experimentation laboratories. However, the colonial experience looks more similar to a \"bundle treatment\" than a single treatment. It is difficult to disentangle the role of differences in legal origin from the influences of human capital, etc. To try to overcome this problem, past empirical approaches use a variety of methods like case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables. I will try to move one step further in this debate by considering the initial years of the Spanish colonization of Latin America as a natural experiment. My methodological approach has four advantages. First, since I only analyse the initial years of colonization, my empirical strategy is based on the fact that the initial conquerors had no knowledge of the land that they intended to conquer. The second advantage is that, in working with the colonization of Latin America, we only have one colonial power, Spain, which avoids the traditional problems of diversity of legal origins. The third advantage is that the contracts (“Capitulaciones”), that the conquerors signed with the King before embarking to America, and before even knowing anything about the land that he would conquer, and other documents from the Archivo de Indias, provide very rich details on the rules that governed the early institutions (power to tax and rule, the use of military power, the treatment of indigenous groups, etc.). Finally, these documents contain information to locate the initial settlements at the subnational level. The colonization of the Americas and the information contained in the “Capitulaciones” found in the Archivo de Indias provides a unique opportunity to advance the debate on these crucial questions.",
