        "Title: Redefining Musical Interpretation Through Experimental Performance Practices\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research proposal seeks to challenge traditional notions of musical interpretation by examining the shift from text-based to performative-based renderings of musical works. It aims to investigate the historical context of musical interpretation, the potential of experimental performance practices to create new paths of inquiry, and the applicability of the scientific model of experimentation to music performance. By engaging in artistic practice and generating concrete artistic outputs, this project will contribute to innovations in both theory and practice, paving the way for new scholarship and performance practices. This project combines theoretical investigation with practical music-making, presenting a case for transforming the field of musical performance. By reflecting critically on current understandings of interpretation and proposing alternative approaches, this research will contribute to the burgeoning field of Artistic Research and the Orpheus Research Centre in Music's focus on Artistic Experimentation."

The aim of this research proposal is to investigate: (a) the extent to which the traditional conception of musical interpretation is bound to a given historical period; (b) how new investigative paths can be created through experimental performance practices; and (c) the extent to which the scientific model of the practice of experimentation is transferable to music performance. Crucial to these objectives is the material engagement in artistic practice, including the generation of concrete artistic outputs by the PI and other team members. The practice of music – understood as a fundamental methodological tool for the generation and exposition of new knowledge, will contribute decisively to innovations in both theory and practice, opening up opportunities for both scholarship and future performance practices. While exploring alternative approaches to music performance, this project will deliver concrete examples of such possibilities, situating itself at the frontline of the burgeoning field of Artistic Research. Combining theoretical investigation with the concrete practice of music, this project presents a case for change in the field of musical performance. Alongside critical reflection on the state-of-the-art, it proposes a graspable and ‘audible’ alternative to traditional understandings of ‘interpretation’ in musical performance. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, it will benefit from, and contribute to, the wider discourse on Artistic Experimentation, the Centre's current research focus.",
