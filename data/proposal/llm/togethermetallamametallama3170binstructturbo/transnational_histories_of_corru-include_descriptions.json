        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project proposes a historical examination of the concept of \"corruption\" in South-East-Central Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. By analyzing the narratives of both regional insiders and foreign observers, we will explore how the idea of corruption was popularized and linked to the region's perceived cultural and economic underdevelopment. Our research aims to deconstruct the notion of corruption as an endemic feature of the region, instead revealing its complex historical evolution in the context of modernization and the influence of Western European ideas. We will investigate how regional leaders and Great Powers reframed traditional customs and practices as corrupt, often attributing them to the Ottoman legacy. By tracing the genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes surrounding corruption, this project seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the region's history and its place within the broader narrative of modernization. Our findings will have significant implications for contemporary debates on patronage, graft, and center-periphery relations, offering a fresh perspective on the region's historiography and its relevance to global discussions on corruption and modernity."

A wide range of foreign observers portrayed graft, nepotism, and bribery as endemic. Indigenous critics echoed many of these assessments. Regional insiders and outsiders alike mobilized commentaries on “corruption” for their own political, professional, and personal ends, claiming they could run more honest and efficient administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations than those in power. These notables linked “corruption” to the region's supposed cultural backwardness and economic under-development. In doing so, public figures naturalized notions of “corruption,” making it appear both widespread and organic in the region—popularizing tropes that have endured right down to the present. Yet, “corruption” is a historically specific concept. TransCorr seeks to construct a history of the idea of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe in conjunction with the rise of modernity. It demonstrates how in the context of new ideas about modernity emanating from West Europe, regional leaders reframed a host of traditional customs and practices as corrupt. It examines how Great Power attempts to transform these borderlands into formal and informal imperial provinces further entrenched novel understandings of “corruption”, often pejoratively associating them with the Ottoman legacy. By tracing out this history, TransCorr reveals a genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes that continue to inform analyses of and discussions within the region today. The project brings the study of this geographic area into greater dialogue with a global story of modernization and aligns the region’s historiography with new innovations in the scientific literature. It also reframes contemporary debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigures broader understandings of center-periphery relations within the region and across the continent.",
