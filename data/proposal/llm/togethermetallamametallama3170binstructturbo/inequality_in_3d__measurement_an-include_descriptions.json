        "**Title: Unveiling the Dynamics of 3D Inequality: A Multidimensional Analysis of Consumption, Income, and Wealth**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between inequality and macroeconomic phenomena. By leveraging innovative microdata, we will investigate the dynamics of inequality along three key dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth. Recent advancements in heterogeneous agent models have highlighted the critical role of microeconomic heterogeneity in shaping macroeconomic aggregates and policy outcomes. However, the lack of precise micro-level data has hindered our ability to identify the most important mechanisms driving these interactions. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by providing novel empirical insights into the interplay between inequality and the macroeconomy. Our research will inform the development of more accurate macroeconomic models, ultimately leading to improved fiscal and monetary policy tools. Furthermore, our findings will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the forces driving growing inequality, providing valuable lessons for policymakers seeking to address this pressing issue."

We will study inequality and its dynamics along three dimensions: Consumption, Income and Wealth, “3D Inequality.” With novel microdata we can measure the entirety of the economy down to the single household along the 3 dimensions. In macroeconomics, much theoretical progress has been made in understanding when distributions matter for aggregates. Newer heterogeneous agent models deliver strikingly different implications for monetary and fiscal policies than what the traditional representative agent models do, and also allow us to study the distributional implications of different policies across households. In principle, this class of models can incorporate the potentially rich interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy: on the one hand, inequality shapes macroeconomic aggregates; on the other hand, macroeconomic shocks and policies affect inequality. However, absent precise micro-level facts it is difficult to establish which of the potential mechanisms highlighted by these models are the most important in reality. Our empirical efforts will be disciplined by these recent developments in modelling macroeconomic phenomena with microeconomic heterogeneity. Our overarching motivation is to quantify the type of micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory and thereby inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models. The novel insights we aim to provide could lead to substantial improvements in both fiscal and monetary policy tools. Furthermore, a better understanding of the forces behind growing inequality will inform the current debate on this issue and provide important lessons to policy makers who see economic inequality as a problem in itself.",
