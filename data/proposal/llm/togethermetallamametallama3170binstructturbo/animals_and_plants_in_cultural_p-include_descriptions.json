        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nTitle: Exploring the Interconnectedness of Human and Non-Human Life in Amazonian Cultural Productions\n\nThis project aims to investigate the dynamic relationships between humans and non-human beings in the Amazon region, as represented in various cultural productions such as literature, cinema, art, and mythology. By drawing on Amazonian thought and ecocriticism, we seek to understand how these productions give voice to animals and plants, and how they contribute to a deeper understanding of the interdependence between humans and non-humans. The concept of zoophytography will be developed to describe the inscription of non-humans in texts, films, and artworks, challenging traditional notions of human-centered meaning-making.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of archival sources from the early 20th century onwards, this project will examine the representation of Amazonian animals and plants in cultural productions. Two primary research streams will focus on the articulation of animals (zoography) and the inscription of plants (phytography) in these productions. By exploring the perspectives of Indigenous and riverine epistemologies, as well as Western philosophy, this project will contribute significantly to the environmental humanities, offering new insights into ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. Ultimately, this research will highlight the urgent need to address environmental degradation in Amazonia and promote more equitable views on the region's diverse fauna and flora."

The key hypothesis of ECO is that texts (broadly understood to include mythology, folk tales, the lyrics of songs, essays, literature, travel writings, etc.), cinema and art about this area highlight the ways in which non-human beings dynamically shape human cultural life. The project’s main challenge is to resort both to Amazonian thought and to the academic field of ecocriticism to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants. ECO develops the concept of zoophytography to describe the inscription of non-humans in texts, films and artworks, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making. Research stream I. “Amazonian Zoophytography” formulates a definition of this notion and traces its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies and to Western philosophy. Through archival research, ECO will then gather and analyze sources that portray Amazonian animals and plants from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards in two other research streams: II. “Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out” focuses on the articulation of animals in cultural productions about the Amazon; III. “Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations” analyzes plant inscription in texts, cinema and artworks that question the role of vegetal life as a passive form of existence. ECO will make a significant contribution to the environmental humanities, offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy and post-colonial studies. By creating a deeper understanding of conceptions of Amazonian fauna and flora, the project will reveal the interdependence of humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia and uncover more equitable views on animals and plants from the region.",
