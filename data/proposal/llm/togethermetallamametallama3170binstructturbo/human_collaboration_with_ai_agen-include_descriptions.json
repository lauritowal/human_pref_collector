        "**Title:** Investigating Human Agency in AI-Driven National Health Governance: A Comparative Multi-Sited Ethnography\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the integration of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in national health systems, a rapidly evolving trend with significant implications for global health governance. Despite growing concerns about algorithmic ethics and the potential for AI to perpetuate social biases, existing research has primarily focused on the design and institutional frameworks of AI systems, neglecting the socio-cultural contexts in which they operate. This study will address this knowledge gap through a comparative multi-sited ethnography, examining the interactions between human agents and AI systems in six national settings with diverse governmental frameworks and organizational contexts. By analyzing critical moments in which data analysts follow or deviate from AI recommendations, we aim to develop a theory on the contextual and organizational factors underlying ethical AI decision-making. Our innovative approach combines anthropological methods with expertise from AI developers and policymakers, enabling us to both analyze and contribute to the development of fair AI in healthcare."

With health data being considered countries’ ‘future oil’, public and scholarly concerns about ‘algorithmic ethics’ rise. Research has long shown that datasets in AI (re)produce social biases, discriminate and limit personal autonomy. This literature, however, has merely focused on AI design and institutional frameworks, examining the subject through legal, technocratic and philosophical perspectives, whilst overlooking the socio-cultural context in which big data and AI systems are embedded, most particularly organizations in which human agents collaborate with AI. This is problematic, as frameworks for ‘ethical AI’ currently consider human oversight crucial, assuming that humans will correct or resist AI when needed; while empirical evidence for this assumption is extremely thin. Very little is known about when and why people intervene or resist AI. Research done consists of single, mostly Western studies, making it impossible to generalize findings. The innovative force of our research is fourfold: 1) To empirically analyze decisive moments in which data-analysts follow or deviate AI: moments deeply impacting national health policies and individual human lives. 2) To do research in six national settings with various governmental frameworks and in different organizational contexts, enabling us to contrast findings, eventually leading to a theory on the contextual, organizational factors underlying ethical AI. 3) To use innovative anthropological methods of future-scenarioing, which will enrich the anthropological discipline by developing and finetuning future-focused research. 4) The research connects anthropological insights with the expertise of AI-developers, and partners with relevant health decisionmakers and policy-institutions, allowing to both analyze and contribute to fair AI.",
