        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nFood charities play a vital role in alleviating food insecurity among urban populations, particularly in the wake of the Great Recession. The shift towards sustainable food systems and reduced waste, coupled with diminishing welfare benefits, has led to the emergence of complex charitable food provision (CFP) networks. Despite their widespread presence, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks to compare and understand CFP across countries and cities.\n\nThis research proposal seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by examining the evolution and dynamics of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. The project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining event sequence analysis, social network analysis, and urban ethnography to chart the historical trajectory of CFP, examine current CFP dynamics, and investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support.\n\nThe proposed research will not only contribute to the development of a comparative framework for CFP but also introduce an innovative tool for real-time data collection on urban CFP dynamics. By exploring CFP in diverse institutional settings and across multiple cities, this study will provide new insights into the intersection of food support, sustainability, and social policy, ultimately informing more effective strategies to address food insecurity in urban environments."

Their significance, particularly after the Great Recession, is underscored by two pivotal shifts: one towards the sustainable utilisation of food surplus and waste reduction, and the other reflecting societal changes with diminishing welfare benefit provision. While considerable research addresses food insecurity and support, the literature lacks a robust framework to understand and compare Charitable Food Provision (CFP) across countries and cities. Despite the almost universal occurrence of such transitions, existing studies have not yet contextualised this phenomenon within the diverse arrangements of welfare and civil society regimes, and the influence of transitions in agri-food sustainability on CFP. Accordingly, this proposal aims to: 1. Use event sequence analysis to chart the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, examining the emergence and consolidation of professionalised CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings. 2. Adopt mixed-methods social network analysis to examine current CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, focusing on providers interrelationships, operational modes, and their ties with both state and non-state authorities. 3. Harness urban ethnography to investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support to understand how CFP becomes part of poor peopleâ€™s survival strategies. Additionally, it introduces an innovative tool, tailored for city workshops, to facilitate real-time data collection on (CFP) urban dynamics. Hence, it combines the findings obtained by crafting an overarching framework to extend CFP comparison to other countries and cities. The research will create new knowledge across urban, sustainability, organisation, food, and social policy studies, offering an innovative, comparative insight into food support and insecurity.",
