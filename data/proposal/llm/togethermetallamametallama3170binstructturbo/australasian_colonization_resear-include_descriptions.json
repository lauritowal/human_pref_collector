        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to investigate the maritime migration of modern humans to Australasia, a pivotal event in human history dating back at least 50,000 years. By integrating archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics, we will explore the early seafaring dispersal from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia), which represents the earliest known 'open water' crossing globally. The project's objectives include reconstructing the submerged palaeolandscape of the northwestern Australian continental shelf, identifying potential submerged prehistoric sites, and analyzing the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. Additionally, we will conduct archaeogenetic research focusing on mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to shed light on demography, dating, and population dynamics. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this project aims to address fundamental questions about human origins, the interplay between humans and the environment, migration patterns, seafaring technologies, social organization, and cognitive development. The findings of this research will significantly contribute to our understanding of human colonization and the earliest seafaring in world history."

This represents some of the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa, yet, even at the greatest sea-level lowstand, this migration would have involved seafaring. It is the maritime nature of this dispersal which makes it so important to questions of technological, cognitive and social human development. These issues have traditionally been the preserve of archaeologists, but with a multidisciplinary approach that embraces cutting-edge marine geophysical, hydrodynamic and archaeogenetic analyses, we now have the opportunity to examine the When, Where, Who and How of the earliest seafaring in world history. The voyage from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia) provides evidence for the earliest ‘open water’ crossing in the world. A combination of the sparse number of early archaeological finds and the significant changes in the palaeolandscape and submergence of the broad north western Australian continental shelf, mean that little is known about the routes taken and what these crossings may have entailed. This project will combine research of the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf to refine our knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, identify potential submerged prehistoric sites and enhance our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. This will be combined with archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and dating. For the first time this project takes a truly multidisciplinary approach to address the colonization of Sahul, providing an unique opportunity to tackle some of the most important questions about human origins, the relationship between humans and the changing environment, population dynamics and migration, seafaring technology, social organisation and cognition.",
