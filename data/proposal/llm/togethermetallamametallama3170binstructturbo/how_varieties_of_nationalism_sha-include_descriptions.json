        "**Title: Mapping Nationalism and Polarization in Advanced Democracies**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the complex relationship between nationalism and electoral polarization in advanced democracies, seeking to understand how national identities shape and intersect with partisan divisions. Contrary to prevailing theories, which attribute polarization to a fundamental clash between strong national attachments and universalist values, our research proposes that different varieties of nationalism underlie the deepening divisions in contemporary politics. To investigate this hypothesis, our study employs a multi-method comparative research design, combining novel survey data analysis, elite interviews, and public opinion research.\n\nOur project is structured around three interconnected work packages. The first examines how public understandings of nationalism influence partisan divisions, using innovative open-ended survey questions to capture nuanced national identities. The second work package investigates how political elites mobilize support by appealing to different varieties of nationalism. The third work package assesses the impact of these elite appeals on public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nBy challenging conventional wisdom on the relationship between nationalism and polarization, this project aims to contribute to both academic research and public debates on the challenges facing advanced democracies. Our findings will provide critical insights into the complex dynamics driving electoral polarization, ultimately informing strategies for mitigating division and promoting more inclusive democratic societies."

Across advanced democracies, concerns over deepening divisions have proliferated in recent years, and national identities have emerged as a prime suspect in driving this polarization. According to the common framework in electoral politics research, this polarization is shaped by a transnational cleavage that has at its core a cultural conflict between national attachments and universalist values. VARNATPOL proposes a different perspective: that the dividing lines structuring our politics are drawn not between those with stronger and weaker national attachments, but rather across groups who subscribe to different varieties of nationalism. To assess how varieties of nationalism shape polarization, VARNATPOL theorizes and empirically investigates how national identities are linked with mass attitudes and commitments to democratic norms, map onto partisan identities, and provide opportunities for political mobilization. VARNATPOLâ€™s theoretical approach calls for a multi-method comparative research design. The first Work Package analyzes novel survey data to investigate how common understandings of nationalism in the public shape partisan divisions, and includes methodological innovations using open-ended survey questions to study national identities. The second Work Package examines how elites differ in their efforts to mobilize support based on appeals to the varieties of nationalism identified in the first Work Package. The third Work Package explores whether elite appeals to national identities shape polarization through their effect on public opinion and partisan hostility. Challenging the common wisdom regarding the ways in which nationalism polarizes the electoral arena, VARNATPOL will contribute not only to academic research but also to public debates about the challenges facing our societies.",
