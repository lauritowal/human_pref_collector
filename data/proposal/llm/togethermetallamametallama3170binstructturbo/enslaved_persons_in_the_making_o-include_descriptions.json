        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"Unveiling the Hidden Histories of Enslavement\" is a groundbreaking research project aimed at redefining our understanding of ancient slave societies. By centering on the experiences and actions of enslaved individuals, this project will uncover the diverse identities, networks, and communities that slaves formed and participated in, and reveal their profound impact on the social, economic, cultural, and political landscapes of the ancient world. Spanning Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE, this comprehensive study will break new ground by examining all forms of ancient slavery, incorporating a wide range of languages and archaeological sources. A multidisciplinary research team will create a large-scale digital database of ancient slaves, providing a powerful tool for innovative quantitative and qualitative research in the Digital Humanities. Through this project, we will produce a monograph, two collective volumes, and numerous articles, PhD dissertations, workshops, and a conference, ultimately rewriting the history of antiquity with enslaved individuals at its core."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",
