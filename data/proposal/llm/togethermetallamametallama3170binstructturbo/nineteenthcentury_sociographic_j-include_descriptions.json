        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project undertakes a pioneering examination of 19th-century sociographic journalism as a pivotal force in shaping social knowledge and science. By scrutinizing the rich ethnographic details and intellectual debates embedded in these journalistic accounts, our study seeks to redress the neglect of journalism as a founding genre of modern social science. Through a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational approach, we will reframe the historiography of social knowledge, challenging prevailing mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric narratives. Our investigation will focus on the representational techniques, epistemic connections, socio-spatial contexts, and institutional interactions of sociographic journalism, drawing on a diverse corpus of texts from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and post-colonial Latin America. The project's outcomes will include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs, collectively contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of social knowledge and its intersections with urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and academic discipline formation."

It represents the first comprehensive study to investigate pieces of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as formative frames/catalysts of social knowledge and science. These social sketches (often referred to as panoramic literature) provide rich ethnographic micro-analysis and often relate to debates held by statisticians, moralists, folklorists, and ethnologists. However, in the discipline-oriented histories of the social sciences and humanities, journalism has been ignored as a form of knowledge and as a founding genre of modern (disciplinary, academic) social science. By exploring the epistemic significance of sociographic journalism, the project promises to institute a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational historiography of the evolution of social knowledge and to revise mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric tales of the past and present. The project has five kinds of outcome: a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. The corpus comprises social sketches and examples of related knowledge frames (travel accounts, philanthropic reports, caricatures etc.) from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The project develops an innovative mix of anthropological/historiographical approaches to examine (1) the representational techniques of sociographic journalism (e.g., methods of constructing social types, the influence of scientific paradigms); (2) how it connects with epistemic developments (e.g., towards materialist and historicizing conceptions of society); (3) its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects; and (4) how the journalistic sketches are to be situated against processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.",
