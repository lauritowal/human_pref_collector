        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThe human gut microbiome, comprising trillions of microorganisms, is a promising source of individual differences in human behavior and brain function. As gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters such as Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) and serotonin, this project aims to investigate the impact of gut-derived GABA on brain function and behavior. By employing a biochemical approach, we will examine the relationship between the gut microbiome's GABA-producing capacity and brain GABA levels, as well as performance in GABA-ergic tasks, in human adults. The first phase of the study will utilize Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to directly measure brain GABA levels in relation to the gut microbiome's GABA-producing potential. The second phase will involve a four-week probiotic intervention with GABA-producing bacteria to assess the effects on brain and behavioral measures. By integrating expertise from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, this interdisciplinary project seeks to address a fundamental question: Does the gut microbiome's GABA-producing capacity, and its modulation by probiotics, influence brain GABA levels and function? This research has the potential to reveal a novel source of individual differences in human behavior and brain function, contributing to a new frontier in understanding human variation."

It seems striking therefore, that 1% of this genetic difference accounts for the large extent of individual variations seen in human behaviour and brain function. One promising alternative source of individual differences is the resident bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, which is 40-90% distinct between different individuals. Bacteria in the human gut outnumber human cells, and account for nearly 10 times as much DNA as that from human cells. Some gut bacteria have been shown to produce Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT), molecules that function as neurotransmitters in the human brain. However, it is not known whether their production in the gut has any impact on behavioural and brain function. This project takes a biochemically informed approach to address this gap in knowledge through focussing on GABA, whose function as a neurotransmitter is well characterised, and which can be assayed directly or through proxy measures of brain and behaviour. The first work package of this project in human adults will investigate whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA can modulate brain levels of GABA (measured directly using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), as well as performance in tasks that depend on GABA-ergic activity. The second work package will test the impact of ingesting bacteria known to produce GABA (packaged as a custom-made probiotic) over a period of four weeks, on the same brain and behavioural measures. Together, these studies will answer a fundamental question of whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA, as well as its modulation by probiotics, has any impact on the level GABA in the brain and its function. This interdisciplinary proposal brings together approaches from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to chart a new research frontier in understanding individual differences in human behaviour and brain function.",
