        "**Grant Proposal Abstract**\n\nThe proposed project, \"Narratives of Loss and Support for Restrictive Agendas,\" investigates the complex interplay between economic hardship, local and national policy contexts, and public support for socially conservative policies that restrict the rights of marginalized groups. Recent surges in far-right ideology and prejudice in European societies have raised concerns about community cohesion. This interdisciplinary study aims to develop a novel theoretical framework, drawing from insights in political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics, to understand how economic hardship translates into narratives of loss that fuel support for restrictive policies. Employing a multi-method approach combining qualitative and quantitative research, this project will compare policy contexts in five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) and examine local variations within these countries to shed light on the mechanisms driving this relationship."

Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",
