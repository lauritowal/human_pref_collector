        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to uncover the key factors that contribute to the long-term sustainability of complex societies in vulnerable environments. By examining the rise and fall of Byzantine early Christian urban centers in the Negev Desert (4th-7th century AD), we aim to shed light on the interplay between human ingenuity, socio-political complexity, and environmental pressures. Through an integrative approach combining archaeology, biomolecular analysis, and geological research, we will investigate the impact of climate change, economic stress, and environmental degradation on the collapse and resilience of these ancient societies.\n\nOur project addresses a pressing concern in a world where human development increasingly threatens marginal ecosystems. By analyzing the successes and failures of past societies, we can develop more nuanced theories on societal vulnerability and the limits of human ingenuity in balancing economic development with sustainable resource management. This research will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of ancient societies but also inform contemporary debates on sustainability and environmental management. Our findings will provide valuable insights into the complex relationships between human societies and their environments, ultimately helping to mitigate the risks of systemic collapse in the face of environmental challenges."

The broad aim of the research is to explore contexts of collapse and resilience in an ancient society with high levels of socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity within a resource-limited environment. It focuses on the Byzantine early Christian urban centres of the Negev Desert (4th-7th cent. AD) disclosing both the triumph of human ingenuity in conquering the desert through large-scale human settlement and agricultural development as well as a striking and as yet ambiguous case of wholesale systemic collapse. To test hypotheses regarding social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation due to climatic or anthropogenic causes, and the question of plague the project integrates approaches in the archaeology of households, landscapes and garbage through use of biomolecular, botanical, zoological, geological, chronometric, artifactual and contextual sources of data. Dealing with societal vulnerability in marginal regions is timely and relevant in a world where accelerating development rapidly expands such problems, previously localized, to global levels. Although it is a risky endeavour to engage the record of past societies to inform the present and forecast the future due to the typically underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, this project offers substantial gain to theoretical and empirical research on societal vulnerability in two main avenues: (1) providing an opportunity to critically re-evaluate the current state of knowledge in the field based on an extensive corpus of new, high-quality data and (2) drawing more nuanced and informed broad generalizations regarding limiting states for human ingenuity in reconciling social and economic development with sustainable management of the environment and its resources.",
