        "**Abstract:**\n\nCooperation on a massive scale is crucial in addressing pressing global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics. However, current behavioral models fall short in explaining why individuals choose to act in the collective interest. To bridge this gap, our interdisciplinary research program aims to integrate insights from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology into a comprehensive, experimentally tested framework for understanding human cooperation. \n\nThe proposed research will first develop and test a foundational model of cooperation based on rule-following behavior. Building on this foundation, we will investigate the interconnections between various behavioral principles of cooperation and provide novel analyses of classic social dilemma models. Finally, we will apply our framework to real-world cooperation problems, including climate change mitigation, using incentivized experiments in diverse global samples. \n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to establish a unified science of human cooperation, equipping researchers and policymakers with a robust, interdisciplinary framework for studying cooperation and developing effective solutions to global challenges. By providing a deeper understanding of the complex factors driving human cooperation, our research aims to inform evidence-based policies and interventions that promote collective action and mitigate the consequences of inaction."

A failure to cooperate, that is, to act in one’s self-interest rather than the collective interest, could spell a bleak future for humanity. When are people prepared to play their part in the solution of these fundamental problems? Current behavioural models of cooperation from across the social sciences, including economics, are inadequate for answering this fundamental question, because they typically focus on one narrow aspect of people’s behaviour, but people might be motivated by different factors at the same time. Hence, to make progress, an integrated approach is needed. The major ambition of my interdisciplinary research programme is to achieve synergy by combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology into a novel experimentally tested framework thereby making a major step forward in the creation of a unified science of human cooperation. Rule following is the most basic behaviour to achieve large-scale cooperation. I will use it as a first step to develop, and experimentally test a comprehensive model of behavioural principles of cooperation. Second, I will then employ the framework to systematically investigate behavioural links between previously disjointed behavioural principles as developed across the social sciences. I also use the model to provide comprehensive new behavioural analyses of the most important models of social dilemmas. Finally, I will use the new framework in representative samples from major economies around the globe to explain people’s behaviour in relevant large-scale cooperation problems, most importantly caring for the climate, by using incentivised experiments. PRINCIPLES will equip researchers and policy makers across disciplines with behavioural principles, tools and data to study problems of cooperation using an interdisciplinary and experimentally tested framework.",
