        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nRegulatory Institutions and Credibility in Action (RICA) aims to revolutionize the understanding of the regulatory state by challenging long-held assumptions about the relationship between regulatory independence and credibility. The current normative framework prioritizes agency insulation from politics, which has led to a rise in non-majoritarianism and diminished the role of the political process. However, this approach has proven inadequate in ensuring accountability and legitimacy.\n\nRICA adopts a novel perspective, informed by insights from reputation theory, to re-examine the interplay between regulatory autonomy and accountability. The project consists of two interconnected modules. Module 1 critically evaluates the conventional wisdom that agency insulation enhances credibility, hypothesizing instead that insulation may have deleterious effects on regulatory legitimacy. Module 2 develops a new theory of public accountability, exploring how reputation influences the behavior of regulatory actors and their interactions. By reconceptualizing the role of accountability in the regulatory state, RICA seeks to demonstrate that, paradoxically, accountability can reinforce autonomy, with significant implications for regulatory control strategies and institutional design."

Arm’s length governance and regulatory independence have become the cornerstone normative and institutional design principles of the European regulatory state. Regulatory credibility is premised on agency insulation from politics with major systemic implications in the form of a rise in non-majoritarianism and a parallel devaluation of the political process. Efforts to compensate through alternative sources of input legitimacy have proven challenging. Conceptualised in a rational-choice tradition, accountability is seen to be in a zero-sum relationship with regulatory autonomy. Bolstering accountability is said to threaten autonomy, undermining the system’s normative foundations. Informed by insights from the political science literature on reputation, RICA profoundly questions these assumptions. It does so in two separate and interlocking tracks. Module 1 theorises about, and tests, the established wisdom of a wholesale positive relation between agency insulation and credibility. To the contrary, from a reputational perspective, a strategy of insulation is expected to have a negative effect on regulatory credibility, with overall delegitimising effects. Similarly informed by reputation insights, Module 2 challenges dominant understandings of accountability and puts forward the building blocks of a new theory of public accountability. The module draws out and studies empirically how reputation shapes the accountability behaviour of regulatory actors, both account-holders and account-givers, and their interactions. It will re-conceptualise the role played by accountability in the regulatory state as well as its relationship with autonomy. In contrast to dominant understandings, as a mechanism of reputation-building, accountability can reinforce autonomy with sweeping implications for regulatory control strategies and institutional design choices.",
