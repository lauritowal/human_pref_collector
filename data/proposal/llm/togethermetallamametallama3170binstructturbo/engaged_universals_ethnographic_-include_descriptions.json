        "**Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis anthropological research project, titled \"Implementing Universal Health Coverage in Africa,\" examines the adoption and implementation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) policies in three African countries. UHC, a concept promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and included in the Sustainable Development Goals, aims to ensure equitable access to healthcare without financial hardship. In Africa, where structural adjustment policies have weakened state capacity and promoted privatization, UHC presents a unique opportunity to reexamine state responsibility and the public good in healthcare.\n\nThis project will investigate how UHC policies engage with global, national, and local actors and institutions, and how they intersect with formal social protection systems and informal social networks. Through multi-sited, multi-level ethnographic fieldwork, the project will track the challenges and frictions surrounding UHC implementation, from policy-making to public debate. By situating UHC within national histories and social practices, the project will produce knowledge on relevance beyond Africa, contributing to new research directions on global policies and the public good."

Defined by the WHO as ensuring that all people can use the health services they need without financial hardship, UHC is a powerful concept that approaches public health as a matter of justice and obligation and is included in the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC is particularly important in Africa, where structural-adjustment policies undermined state capacity, promoted privatization and pushed the burden of payment onto the poor. Recent global health initiatives have done little to address the neglect of national health-care systems and citizens’ lack of trust in them. In these contexts UHC is interesting because it reinserts questions of state responsibility and the public good into health-care. Historically however, African states have only partially pursued the public good, while in practice UHC is surrounding by conflicting interests. UHC is thus not a universal model but a contested field, making it an intriguing site for anthropological research. With a focus on actors and institutions at global, national and local levels in each country, the project will explore how moves towards UHC engage relations between states and citizens and universal concepts such as the public good; how UHC intersects with formal systems of social protection; and how it influences informal social networks that support health, thus situating UHC in national histories and social practices. Tracking the frictions surrounding UHC at the levels of policy-making, implementation, among beneficiaries, and in public debate, the project will use ethnographic methodology in innovative ways through fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level. The project’s focus on a global policy and the public good opens new research directions and will produce knowledge of relevance beyond Africa.",
