        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal seeks to explore the transformative impact of formalism on the philosophy of science and logic in the early twentieth century. By tracing the historical roots of formalist thinking in mathematics and neo-Kantian epistemology, our project aims to provide the first comprehensive comparative study of the formal turn in these disciplines. We will investigate the methodological developments in geometry and algebra between 1860 and 1910 that laid the groundwork for a formalist conception of mathematics, as well as the contributions of the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism to a formalist notion of scientific objectivity.\n\nOur project will also undertake a comparative analysis of the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940, examining the work of key figures such as David Hilbert, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. Furthermore, we will investigate the philosophical implications of the formal turn, exploring its connections to contemporary debates in the philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nBy bridging historical, philosophical, and logical perspectives, our project seeks to deepen our understanding of the formal turn's lasting impact on the philosophy of science and logic, and to shed new light on the evolution of these disciplines."

This shift is characterized by a new emphasis on formal methods and the adoption of a general formalist viewpoint towards the disciplines in question. The project will give a first interdisciplinary and comparative study of early contributions to formalism in twentieth-century thought. This general objective will be addressed in terms of three interrelated subprojects. The first subproject is historical in character and aims at a historical reconstruction of the emergence of formalist thinking in nineteenth-century mathematics and neo-Kantian epistemology. On the mathematical side, the project will retrace several methodological developments in geometry and algebra between 1860 and 1910 that contributed to a formalist conception of these fields. Regarding its philosophical roots, the focus will be on contributions to a formalist notion of scientific objectivity in the work of the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism (Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, Paul Natorp). The second subproject will give a comparative study of the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940. This includes research on the foundations of mathematics and the formality of logic by members of the GÃ¶ttingen school (David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen) as well as central contributions to a scientific formalism in logical empiricism (Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick). The third subproject will analyze the philosophical implications of the formal turn for the subsequent shaping of these fields. The emergence of formalist thinking was closely related to the development of new theories of semantics in logic and philosophy. The aim will therefore be to connect the early contributions to formalism with contemporary debates on the philosophy of model theory and inferentialism as well as with the logical study of scientific theories.",
