        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Unveiling the Secrets of Nautical Charts\"**\n\nThe nautical chart, a crucial tool in the early modern maritime expansion, remains an understudied aspect of cartographic history. Despite its significance, the technical development and usage of pre-Mercator nautical charts are still shrouded in mystery. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap through an interdisciplinary approach, combining traditional historical research with innovative analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and specialized lighting techniques to examine manuscript charts.\n\nBy applying these tools to a diverse sample of charts from various periods and origins, this research seeks to uncover hidden graphic content, characterize geometric features, and establish connections with contemporary navigational methods and exploration missions. Numerical simulations will also be used to reconstruct chart construction processes, informed by textual sources.\n\nBuilding on the success of previous studies, which solved the long-standing enigma of the Mercator projection, this project tackles a broader and more complex set of questions that have eluded historians of cartography for centuries. The findings of this research promise to have a profound impact on the field of cartographic history, as well as the broader context of intellectual history, shedding new light on the technical and scientific developments that underpinned the early modern maritime expansion."

This fact is very surprising as it was through those charts that the newly discovered world was first shown to the amazed eyes of the European nations. Although the History of Cartography is a well-established academic discipline and old charts have been examined for many years, their detailed technical study is still in its infancy. What is the origin of the pre-Mercator nautical chart, how charts evolved technically over time and how they were used at sea are all critical questions that remain to be answered. I intend to approach these challenges in a truly interdisciplinary way, by using innovative and powerful tools as a complement to the traditional methods of historical research: analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling and the examination of the manuscripts through special lighting. By applying these tools to a large sample of charts of various periods and origins, I aim to unveil hidden graphic content related to their construction and use, to characterize their main geometric features, to establish meaningful connections with contemporary navigational methods and exploration missions, and to numerically simulate their construction by taking into account the explanations given in the textual sources. The effectiveness of those techniques has already been demonstrated in my previous studies, such as in the solution of an historical enigma which had been alive for more than a century: the construction of the Mercator projection, in 1569. Now, I propose to handle a broader and more complex set of questions, which has eluded the historians of cartography for even a longer period. The clarification of these issues will have a ground-breaking impact, not only in the strict field of the History of Cartography, but also in the context of the intellectual history at large.",
