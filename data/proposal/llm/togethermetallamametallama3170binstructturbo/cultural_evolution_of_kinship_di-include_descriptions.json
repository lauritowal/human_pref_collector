        "**Title: Exploring the Evolution and Dynamics of Kinship Systems**\n\nThis project proposes an interdisciplinary investigation into the variable ways human societies classify and understand family relationships. We aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving the diversity of kinship systems across cultures and over time. By integrating cultural phylogenetics, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development, we will examine the evolution of kinship terminologies and family norms in eight language families. We will also analyze patterns of kinship language usage in spoken and written contexts, and investigate how children acquire and understand kinship in a non-Western community. \n\nThe proposed research will address three key questions: (1) How do kinship systems change over time, and what factors drive these changes? (2) How do people use kinship language in different contexts, and what meanings are most prevalent? (3) How do children learn and understand kinship across cultures, and what constraints do social norms impose on this process? By examining the interplay between macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics underlying kinship systems, shedding light on the universal and culturally-specific patterns that shape our social worlds."

Why are cousins classed with siblings in some societies but not others? Accounting for the variable ways that cultures classify kin is an enduring puzzle. The VARIKIN project takes a cultural evolutionary approach to variety and unity and engages different fields–cultural phylogenetics, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development. VARIKIN-Evolution asks how and why does kinship diversity evolve across cultures and over time? Using comparative phylogenetic modeling of cultural evolution we investigate the dynamics of how kinship terminologies and family norms change in eight language families. Are there “universal” patterns of change, or does local cultural history and context determine changes in family organisation? How do social norms drive change in kinship terminology? VARIKIN-Usage investigates how people use kinship language by using corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to quantify patterns of usage in spoken and written language. How frequently are kinship terms used in different contexts and what meanings are more prevalent? Do patterns vary between languages, and can the patterns of usage at the individual level be linked to historical processes of change? VARIKIN-Development investigates how children acquire and understand kinship across cultures. Using participant observation and elicitation tasks, we characterise children’s social learning of kinship in a small-scale, non-Western community. Are there cross-cultural patterns of acquisition? Can socialisation produce constraints on the kinds of kinship children can learn? These three research directions are united by a coherent framework for the integration of macro- and micro-evolutionary processes. With a highly multidisciplinary background, the Applicant is uniquely positioned to direct this vanguard project towards a comprehensive understanding of diversity in how we classify our social worlds.",
