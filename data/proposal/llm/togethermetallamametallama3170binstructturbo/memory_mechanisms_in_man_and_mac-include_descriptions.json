        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to validate a set of fundamental claims regarding the human brain's ability to form and maintain long-term sensory memories. The aim is to experimentally confirm the existence of 'Grandmother Cells' that selectively respond to previously encountered stimuli, and to investigate the role of oscillatory brain activity and attention in memory storage. Further, we propose to explore the notion of 'Neocortical Dark Matter,' comprising large populations of silent cells that constitute the long-term memory store.\n\nOur approach will integrate psychological, neuroscientific, computational, and hardware-based methods to study the formation and maintenance of long-term sensory memories. Novel experimental paradigms, combined with advanced imaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and intracerebral recording, will be employed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms. Computational modeling using spiking neural networks with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will complement these findings, informing the development of bio-inspired hardware architectures that mimic the brain's memory systems.\n\nThe project's outcomes will have significant implications for our understanding of human memory and the development of novel, brain-inspired computing technologies. By validating these fundamental claims, we aim to pave the way for innovative approaches to information processing and storage, with potential applications in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to neurological disorders."

We will test these claims with a highly interdisciplinary approach involving psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling and hardware development. Novel experimental paradigms will study the formation and maintenance of very long term sensory memories. They will be combined with imaging techniques including fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients. In parallel, computer simulations using networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will model the experimental results, and develop bio-inspired hardware that mimics the brains memory systems.",
