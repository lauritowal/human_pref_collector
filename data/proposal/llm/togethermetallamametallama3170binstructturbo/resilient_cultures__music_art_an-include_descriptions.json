        "**Title: Navigating Authoritarianism: Resilience and Cultural Critique in Mainland China and Hong Kong**\n\nThis project seeks to understand the complex dynamics of cultural critique and resilience in mainland China and Hong Kong, where intensified authoritarianism and rapid platformization have created a challenging environment for artistic expression. Through a comparative analysis of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, we aim to identify the tactics employed by cultural practitioners to express social and political discontent in these contexts. By examining indie music, folk music, art institutions, and queer cinema, we will explore the ways in which cultural producers in mainland China and Hong Kong adapt to and resist authoritarianism.\n\nOur research will employ a relational comparative approach, combining ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research to unpack the possibilities and limitations of critique in these contexts. A key objective is to establish a network of academics, cultural practitioners, and activists across East Asia and Europe, facilitating knowledge exchange and social impact through workshops, performances, screenings, and an exhibition. By highlighting the diversity and vitality of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, our findings will challenge the notion of an omnipotent state and inspire connections with other localities facing similar challenges, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of cultural resilience in the face of authoritarianism."

How to speak against power while being silenced? How to stay amidst suppression? RESCUE studies how cultural practices in the domains of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, in mainland China and Hong Kong, develop resilient tactics to express their social and political discontent. It theorises resilience and cultural critique in times of intensified authoritarianism and rapid platformization. Whereas such practices can resort to a history of experiences in China to negotiate a recently intensified authoritarianism, cultural practitioners in Hong Kong are facing a compressed authoritarianism – still searching for resilient tactics. RESCUE studies indie music in Hong Kong; folk music in China; the role of official and unofficial art institutes in China and Hong Kong; socially engaged art projects in rural and urban areas in China and Hong Kong; and queer cinema and queer film festivals in China and Hong Kong. It develops a relational comparative analysis between different cultural fields, and at different localities (Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianshui), to unpack the (im)possibilities of critique. RESCUE develops an innovative methodological toolkit, combining ethnography with textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research. RESCUE will establish and consolidate a network of academics, cultural practitioners, and activists in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, through multiple workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition – thereby increasing the social impact of the project. Findings will not only attest to the multivocality, diversity, and vitality of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, thus pushing back against the idea of the omnipotent Chinese state, but also inspire and forge connections to other localities facing a comparable predicament (e.g. Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey).",
