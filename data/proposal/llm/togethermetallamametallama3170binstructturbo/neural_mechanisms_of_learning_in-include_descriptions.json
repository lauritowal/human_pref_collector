        "**Abstract:**\n\nHuman infants possess an extraordinary capacity for learning, rapidly mastering complex skills such as language and social interactions within the first year of life. This proposal posits that two key factors contribute to this remarkable ability: the unique architecture of the human brain and the access to a rich symbolic system. A comprehensive, six-work-package research plan is proposed to investigate the neural basis of infant learning, focusing on statistical computations and symbolic competence from six months of gestation to the end of the first year. Employing non-invasive brain imaging techniques (EEG, MRI, and optical topography), this project will examine the emergence of statistical inferences in preterm infants, the impact of prenatal and postnatal environments on early learning, and the neural mechanisms underlying word meaning and category inference. Additionally, it will assess infant symbolic abilities through a series of experiments evaluating generalization, bidirectionality, and logical operations. The project's findings will be integrated through the development of novel multimodal brain image analysis tools and correlated with functional and maturational markers obtained through MRI. This research aims to elucidate the specific neural functional architecture that enables human learning from the earliest stages of cortical development, providing valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition."

I propose here that two other elements are crucial. The first is the particular human cerebral architecture that constrains statistical computations. The second is the humanâ€™s ability to access a rich symbolic system. I have planned 6 work packages using the complementary information offered by non-invasive brain-imaging techniques (EEG, MRI and optical topography) to understand the neural bases of infant statistical computations and symbolic competence from 6 months of gestation up until the end of the first year of life. WP1 studies from which preterm age, statistical inferences can be demonstrated using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 investigates the consequences of a different pre-term environment (in-utero versus ex-utero) on the early statistical computations in the visual and auditory domains and their consequences on the ongoing brain activity along the first year of life. WP3 explores the neural bases of how infants infer word meaning and word category, and in particular the role of the left perisylvian areas and of their particular connectivity. WP4 questions infant symbolic competency. I propose several criteria (generalization, bidirectionality, use of algebraic rules and of logical operations) tested in successive experiments to clarify infant symbolic abilities during the first semester of life. WP5-6 are transversal to WP1-4: WP5 uses MRI to obtain accurate functional localization and maturational markers correlated with functional results. In WP6, we develop new tools to combine and analyse multimodal brain images. With this proposal, I hope to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture that are critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits.",
