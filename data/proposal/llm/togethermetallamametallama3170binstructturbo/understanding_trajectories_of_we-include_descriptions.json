        "**Title: Understanding Dynamic Wealth Inequality: A Comprehensive Analysis of Long-Term Trajectories**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe rising wealth inequality in affluent societies demands a shift from static analyses to a dynamic understanding of wealth accumulation over individuals' lifetimes. This project aims to systematically examine the variability in long-term wealth trajectories within and between social groups, moving beyond traditional snapshots of average wealth inequality. By integrating insights from disconnected literature, we will investigate how the interplay of income management, family transfers, and asset investments influences wealth trajectory diversity. Our innovative objectives include documenting wealth trajectory variability, identifying intragenerational drivers, establishing intergenerational relationships with family background, and collecting novel life history data on wealth accumulation. To achieve this, we will adopt a novel approach emphasizing diverse wealth gain and loss patterns, challenging the conventional uniform life cycle accumulation model. By combining longitudinal survey and register data with original life history data, and applying advanced quantitative methods, we will map wealth trajectories over extended periods. This project will lay the groundwork for a new understanding of wealth inequality, informing evidence-based social policies to address this pressing issue."

Wealth inequality is on the rise in many affluent societies. It is time to move beyond prevailing static snapshots of average wealth inequality between people to understand this trend. Instead, a dynamic perspective on wealth changes experienced by people over their lifetimes is needed. This dynamic perspective reveals how diverse the trajectories of wealth accumulation are, i.e., the degree of trajectory variability. WEALTHTRAJECT integrates disconnected strands of literature to study how variability in trajectories emerges over time through the interplay of saving and spending of income, receipt of transfers from parents and other family members, and (de-)investment in (un-)profitable assets. WEALTHTRAJECT addresses four main innovative objectives: (i) to document variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives; (ii) to identify intragenerational drivers of variability in wealth trajectories; (iii) to establish the intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories; (iv) to collect novel life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories. To address these objectives, WEALTHTRAJECT innovates by adopting a novel approach emphasising the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses in people's lives. The project challenges the prevalent idea of a uniform hump-shaped life cycle accumulation pattern in wealth. WEALTHTRAJECT breaks new ground by combining longitudinal data from surveys and registers and original life history data on wealth that, for the first time, allow the mapping of wealth trajectories over extended periods of people's lives. Advanced quantitative methods are applied to leverage the untapped potential of these data. WEALTHTRAJECT lays the foundations for a new understanding of wealth inequality to inform relevant social policies.",
