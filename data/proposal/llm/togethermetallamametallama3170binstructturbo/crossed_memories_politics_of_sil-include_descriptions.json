        "**Title:** Unveiling the Complexities of Colonial-Liberation War Memories\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to illuminate the intricate and multifaceted nature of memories surrounding the colonial-liberation wars fought between the Portuguese state and African independence movements from 1961 to 1974/5. Through a diachronic and comparative approach, our research will examine how these pivotal events have been remembered, silenced, and contested in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe. Our central hypothesis posits that these wars triggered memorialization and silencing processes with distinct historical trajectories. The project is divided into two complementary strands: 'State Narratives' and 'Memory in Contestation'. The first strand investigates the role of states in shaping and recognizing the past, while the second highlights the diverse uses of the past and the interplay between social and individual memories. By analyzing the complex and often conflicting memories of these colonial-liberation wars, our project aims to provide a groundbreaking perspective on the field and contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-lasting impact of European colonialism on post-colonial societies."

The project’s main challenge is to produce innovative knowledge about the memories of the wars fought by the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements between 1961 and 1974/5. The approach chosen is simultaneously diachronic and comparative, inasmuch as it contrasts changes that took place between the end of the conflicts and nowadays, regarding how wars, colonial pasts and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that wars - as pivotal moments that ended the cycle of Empire in Portugal and started the cycle of African independences in the former Portuguese colonies - triggered memorialisation and silencing processes which had their own historicity. CROME is divided into two strands. The first one, named ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States’, looks at the role played by the states under consideration in mobilising, articulating and recognising the past, but also in actively generating selective representations. ‘Memory as a battlefield’ is the second strand, which will highlight distinct uses of the past and dynamics between social memories and individual memories. The project intends to demonstrate how wars gave rise to multiple memories and conflicting historical judgements, mostly in Portugal, but also to examine how the specific nature of the (post-)colonial histories of each African country has generated different ways to summon war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies. CROME will, thus, put forward a ground-breaking perspective in terms of colonial-liberation war studies, and will be instrumental in dealing with such traumatic experience, for its comparative approach might help overcoming everlasting constraints still at play today, caused by the historical burden European colonialism left behind.",
