        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project seeks to explore the historical foundations of European religious diversity by examining the legal treatment of minority groups in pre-modern Europe. Through the collection, publication, and analysis of key legal texts, this initiative aims to shed light on the complex relationships between Christian and Muslim polities and their minority populations. The project's comprehensive database will feature a wide range of texts, including Roman and canon law, national and royal laws, urban regulations, and rabbinical and Islamic jurisprudence, all translated into English, French, and Spanish. This resource will serve as a foundational tool for scholars researching the history of minority law and interfaith relations.\n\nThe project will foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research through a series of workshops and an international conference. Comparative thematic studies will facilitate cross-cultural analyses of interfaith dynamics in diverse medieval societies, from the Iberian Peninsula to Eastern Europe. The project's outcomes will include three major publications: a conference proceedings volume, a sourcebook of annotated legal texts, and a monograph on the legal status of minorities in pre-modern Europe. By promoting innovative research and collaboration, this project will enhance our understanding of the complex historical roots of European religious diversity."

Medieval European polities, Christian and Muslim, granted protected and inferior status to selected religious minorities. RELMIN will collect, publish and study legal texts defining the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe. The corpus of texts includes Roman law (in particular in the legal codes of Theodosius and Justinian), canon law (acta of Church councils, the Decretum attributed to Gratian, the Decretales), national or royal law (from “barbarian” law codes of the early Middle Ages to national compilations such as the Siete Partidas of Alfonso X of Castile in the thirteenth century), urban law (particularly the fueros in the Iberian peninsula and hisba manuals in Andalusia), rabbinical responsa, and fatwa collections. The database will contain texts in their original languages and translations into English, French and Spanish, as well as an annotated bibliography on the subject. This will become a major reference tool for research in the history of minority law and of interreligious relations. The project will also hold workshops and a major international conference on Religious diversity in pre-modern Europe. A series of comparative thematic studies on specific aspects of interreligious relations will allow us to compare responses to similar issues in diverse societies, from seventh-century Córdoba to fifteenth-century Krakow. The goal is to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work by scholars from different countries with varying linguistic skills, to encourage new innovative research that cuts across traditional divides. The project will publish three major works in the field: the proceedings of the international conference, a sourcebook of selected legal texts (with translations, commentaries and annotated bibliography), and a monograph on the legal status of minorities in pre-modern Europe.",
