        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nWe propose a research project to develop a comprehensive theory of decentralized trade under conditions of informational asymmetry and limited commitment. In real-world trading environments, parties often possess unequal knowledge about crucial factors, leading to market inefficiencies. The traditional theory of mechanism design is unsuitable for many trading institutions due to its restrictive assumptions about commitment. Existing literature on trading with limited commitment primarily focuses on single transactions, neglecting the complexities of repeated interactions. Our research aims to fill this gap by analyzing decentralized markets with informational asymmetries and repeated trading. We will employ game-theoretic methods to examine the properties of common trading mechanisms and investigate potential remedies to enhance their efficiency. The outcomes of this study will inform the design of effective institutions and contribute to the regulation of markets, ultimately promoting more efficient and equitable trading environments."

In most trading situations, some of the parties possess superior information about critical aspects of the environment. For example, in financial markets, professional investors are better informed about the quality of the assets that they sell to individuals. Similarly, consumers typically have private information about their willingness to pay for goods and services. It is well understood that informational asymmetries are responsible for one of the most serious forms of market inefficiency. Because of its strong assumptions in term of commitment, the standard theory of mechanism design is unsuitable for the study of many actual trading institutions. On the other hand, the focus of most of the existing literature on trading with limited commitment is the case in which the parties can trade at most once. While satisfactory in situations like the sale of a house, this assumption leaves out many important economic environments where the parties trade repeatedly over time. However, repeated transactions are natural both when the objects of trade are non-durable (e.g., services such as phone or internet plans) and when they are durable but divisible (e.g., financial assets). A crucial difference between these cases and those analyzed in the literature is the fact that the information revealed in early transactions may affect the outcome of future negotiations. We plan to provide a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. Our investigation will shed light on the properties of various commonly used trading mechanisms and will inform us about possible remedies to make them more efficient. This will contribute substantially to the design of adequate institutions and to the regulation of markets.",
