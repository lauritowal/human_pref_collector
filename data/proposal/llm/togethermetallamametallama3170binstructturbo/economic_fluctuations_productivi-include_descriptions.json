    "title": "Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective",
    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a unified Keynesian growth framework that integrates the study of business cycles and long-run productivity growth. By combining insights from Keynesian economics and endogenous growth literature, this framework aims to capture the complex interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth, and stabilization policies. The proposed research will be structured into three interconnected parts. First, a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms will be developed to examine the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on productivity growth, as well as the behavior of productivity during large recessions. Second, an open economy Keynesian growth model will be constructed to investigate the relationships between monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth in a global context. Finally, empirical analysis will be conducted to test the hypothesis that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions, using data from the United States and a panel of advanced economies. This research aims to provide new insights into the interconnectedness of business cycles, productivity growth, and policy interventions, with implications for the design of more effective stabilization policies."

Yet, the interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth and stabilization policies are well present in the policy debate, especially since the start of the Great Recession. In this proposal, I will develop a Keynesian growth framework to study business cycles and growth in a unified theory. The framework combines the Keynesian insight that fluctuations might be driven by changes in aggregate demand, with the notion, developed by the endogenous growth literature, that productivity growth is the result of firmsâ€™ investment in innovation. In part I, I will develop a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms, in the spirit of the state-of-the-art quantitative endogenous growth literature. I will use the framework to study the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on productivity growth; to understand the behavior of productivity during large recessions triggered by financial crises, such as the recent Great Recession; and to investigate the possibility that pessimistic expectations might give rise to periods of stagnation. In part II, I will provide an open economy Keynesian growth model, able to capture the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows and productivity growth. I will use the framework to explain why the inception of the euro was associated with a sharp increase in capital flows across its member countries, and with stagnant productivity growth in countries recipients of capital inflows. In part III, I will test the hypothesis, at the heart of the Keynesian growth framework, that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and to monetary and fiscal policy interventions. To this end, I will estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to policy and business cycle shocks, both in the United States and in a panel of advanced economies.",
