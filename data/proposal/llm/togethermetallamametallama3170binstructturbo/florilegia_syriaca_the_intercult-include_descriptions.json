        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal supports the FLOS project, an interdisciplinary endeavor to uncover the evolution of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic during Late Antiquity (1st millennium CE). Focusing on the pivotal yet underrepresented role of Syriac Christianity, the project seeks to illuminate a previously neglected body of Syriac and Christian Arabic sources from the 8th to 11th centuries. By exploring the production of florilegia – anthologies that excerpted and reinterpreted the patristic canon – this research aims to challenge the prevailing Greco-centric perspective and reveal the creative cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity.\n\nThe project consists of two main components: the creation of open-access digital editions of a set of Syriac florilegia, and an in-depth analysis of the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors from the period. These authors drew from Syriac patristic florilegia to address topics like incarnation and the Trinity in the context of interreligious interactions, particularly with Islam. By examining the transformation of shared Christian patrimony in this complex environment, FLOS will significantly enhance our understanding of the intellectual history of both Europe and the Middle East, shedding new light on the cultural heritage of Syriac Christians and informing contemporary European religious discourses."

Syriac Christianity was a pivotal mediator of culture in the Late Antique epistemic space, but is little-known today. FLOS aims to bring to light for the first time a body of highly relevant Syriac and Christian Arabic sources that have hardly ever been studied before. At the end of the millennium, in Islamic-ruled Syria, Mesopotamia, and Iran, Syriac Christians strived to define their religious identity. One of their strategies was the production of florilegia, i.e. anthologies that they used to excerpt and reinvent the patristic canon, a corpus of Greek Christian works of the 2nd–6th centuries shared by European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures. A Greco-centric bias has prevented scholars from viewing these florilegia as laboratories of cultural creativity. FLOS will reverse the state of the art through two groundbreaking endeavours: 1) open-access digital editions of a set of Syriac florilegia of the 8th–10th centuries; 2) a study of many neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors of the 8th–11th centuries. These tremendously important writings drew from Syriac patristic florilegia to pinpoint topics like incarnation and the Trinity against other Christians or Islam, showing how patristic sources were used to create new knowledge for the entangled environment of the Abbasid era. FLOS will thus dramatically improve our understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity; patristic Christianity will emerge as a bridge between the intellectual history of Europe and of the Middle East. By studying how this shared patrimony was transformed in situations of interreligious interaction, especially with Islam, FLOS will facilitate the comprehension of Europe’s current religious discourses, and the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of the Syriac Christians.",
