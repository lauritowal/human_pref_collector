        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nUnlocking the intricacies of human language evolution lies at the heart of understanding our species' unique capacity for complex communication. While other species convey rich information, human language transcends mere information exchange by imbuing meaning and facilitating cooperative goal-oriented interactions. Great ape gestures share similarities with human language in their systematic and meaningful nature, making them crucial to understanding the evolutionary origins of human language.\n\nTwo fundamental features of human language – social learning and syntactic structure – are universally present across cultures. However, these features are curiously absent in the communication systems of our closest relatives. This proposal seeks to address this evolutionary puzzle by investigating the complexities of ape gesture and its relationship to human language.\n\nEmploying a pan-African dataset spanning 17 ape and 9 human groups, this study will tackle three primary objectives: (1) examining cultural variation in ape gesture and its relationship to species, environment, and social interaction; (2) analyzing the impact of signal combination on meaning in ape communication; and (3) comparing human and ape gesture use and comprehension in adults and children. By leveraging innovative and established techniques across a diverse sample, this research aims to shed light on the fundamental question of how human language evolved, ultimately deepening our understanding of what it means to be human."

Other species’ communication contains rich information exchange; but humans do more than broadcast information. Language is used to communicate goals to partners, it goes beyond information: it has meaning. Only great ape gestures show similarly systematic meaningful communication; they are essential to understanding how human language evolved. Beyond meaning, two core features of human language are social learning and syntactic structure. These are universals, present across cultures. We all learn words and how to use them from others, leading to languages and dialects. We all use syntax; expressing different meanings by recombining words. In fact, these two features are common in animal communication: sperm whales learn songs from others; finches re-order notes into different songs. But, in a significant evolutionary puzzle, both appear absent in the communication of our closest relatives. The discovery of meanings in ape gesture resulted from studying ape communication under the challenging natural conditions that allow its full expression. A single study of a single group: it was the tip of the iceberg. Employing pan-African data across 17 ape and 9 human groups. I will tackle three major objectives. (1) Is there cultural variation in ape gesture? We will look at how species, physical environment, and social interaction affect how apes acquire and use gestures. (2) When apes combine signals, does it change their meaning? Moving beyond sequential structure we will look at how apes combine signals to construct meaning, and how the speed, size, and timing of gestures impacts meaning. (3) Human-ape gesture. We will investigate adults’ and children’s use and comprehension of gestures to compare them directly to other apes. Using new and established techniques across a dramatically wider sample I will address the fundamental question of how human language evolved.",
