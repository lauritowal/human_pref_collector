        "**Title: Unraveling the Early Stages of the Bantu Expansion in Central Africa**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe Bantu Expansion, a pivotal event in Late Holocene African history, remains shrouded in controversy and debate. This project seeks to shed new light on the earliest stages of this complex process through an interdisciplinary approach, combining African archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics. Our research team will conduct fieldwork in previously unexplored regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Angola to uncover the timing, location, and archaeological signature of the first Bantu-speaking village communities south of the rainforest.\n\nBy integrating archaeobotanical, palaeoenvironmental, and historical linguistic data, we aim to reconstruct the subsistence, diet, and habitat of early Bantu speakers and their interactions with indigenous hunter-gatherer populations. Our approach will also incorporate archaeozoological, genetic, and phylogenetic modeling to gain a holistic understanding of the interplay between human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa. This project will provide a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the Bantu Expansion, addressing long-standing questions and advancing our knowledge of African history and its ongoing implications."

It is also one of the most controversial issues in African History that still has political repercussions today. It has sparked debate across the disciplines and far beyond Africanist circles in an attempt to understand how the young Bantu language family (ca. 5000 years) could spread over large parts of Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. This massive dispersal is commonly seen as the result of a single migratory macro-event driven by agriculture, but many questions about the movement and subsistence of ancestral Bantu speakers are still open. They can only be answered through real interdisciplinary collaboration. This project will unite researchers with outstanding expertise in African archaeology, archaeobotany and historical linguistics to form a unique cross-disciplinary team that will shed new light on the first Bantu-speaking village communities south of the rainforest. Fieldwork is planned in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Angola that are terra incognita for archaeologists to determine the timing, location and archaeological signature of the earliest villagers and to establish how they interacted with autochthonous hunter-gatherers. Special attention will be paid to archaeobotanical and palaeoenvironmental data to get an idea of their subsistence, diet and habitat. Historical linguistics will be pushed beyond the boundaries of vocabulary-based phylogenetics and open new pathways in lexical reconstruction, especially regarding subsistence and land use of early Bantu speakers. Through interuniversity collaboration archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental and genetic data and phylogenetic modelling will be brought into the cross-disciplinary approach to acquire a new holistic view on the interconnections between human migration, language spread, climate change and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa.",
