        "Title: Assessing the Impact of Social Media on Conflict and Peacebuilding in Africa\n\nAs global initiatives expand internet access to remote regions, millions of people in conflict-affected areas will soon be connected to social media platforms. This project seeks to understand the complex relationship between social media and conflict in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa. By exploring the intersection of social media, peacebuilding, and violence, this research aims to address a critical gap in current debates. Over the next five years, we will investigate three key research questions: How do social media platforms influence transnational conflict dynamics? How do public authorities utilize social media to promote peace or incite violence? And how do individuals experience and respond to conflict through social media? By examining the online dissemination of dangerous speech, the role of social media in conflict migration, and the strategies employed by actors to shape online narratives, this project will provide valuable insights into the impact of social media on conflict and peacebuilding in Africa. The findings will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between social media, conflict, and peacebuilding, ultimately informing policies and interventions that promote peace and stability in conflict-affected communities."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",
