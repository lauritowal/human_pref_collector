        "**Title:** Developing a Comprehensive Building Modeling Approach: Integrating Form, Function, and Use\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nCurrent building modeling tools, including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems, provide an incomplete representation of buildings by solely focusing on physical and material characteristics. This limitation restricts the evaluation of buildings to aspects such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, neglecting the impact of the building on its future users' lives and activities. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a more comprehensive building modeling method that incorporates the purpose, function, and social, cultural, and economic profiles of building users. By integrating existing knowledge on human behavior in built environments with building design, we aim to create a more holistic building modeling approach. This research seeks to address the shortcomings of current building models and provide architects with a more effective tool for designing buildings that meet the needs of their intended users. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the creation of better-designed buildings that positively impact users' lives and the environment, aligning with the growing recognition of the built environment's significant influence on the quality of life and the planet's sustainability."

Buildings, unlike other products, cannot be understood independently of their context, of their intended use, and of their intended users. This shortcoming hinders the ability of current building models to support evaluations other than those based on physical and material characteristics of the building, such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability. In particular, the impact of a building that has not yet been built on the life and activities of its future users—a key element in determining whether or not the proposed building will meet the needs of its intended users—is not afforded by current building models. To afford comprehensive prediction and evaluation of future buildings, we also need to model the purpose and function of the building, and the social, cultural, and economic profile of the people who will use it. Although predicting users' behavior in a built environment and their interaction with the building and with other people is a highly complex task, vast research exists that is devoted to analyzing and explaining human behavior in built environments. Still, due to the shortcomings of building models, this knowledge rarely make into the practice of architectural design, at the time buildings are being designed. The proposed research aims at remedying that shortcoming by developing a more a comprehensive building modeling method, which will include form, function, and use information. A better model will lead to better designed buildings. In an era when the irrevocable impact of the built environment on the cost, quality, and perhaps even possibility of life on earth has been recognized, the need to make every effort to improve the tools used by building designers is self-evident.",
