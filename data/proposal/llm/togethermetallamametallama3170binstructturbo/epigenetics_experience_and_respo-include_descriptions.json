        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThe prevailing understanding of genetics as a fixed blueprint has shaped discussions around psychiatric conditions and responsibility. However, recent advancements in epigenetics have revealed that environmental factors significantly influence gene expression. This project, NEUROEPIGENETHICS, seeks to explore the ethical implications of epigenetics on neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Through a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, we will investigate how shifting conceptualizations of innate, biological, and genetic factors affect attributions of capacity and normative responsibility among professionals, individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, and their families. By examining the interplay between biological and social environments, we aim to redefine moral responsibility in the context of epigenetics and neurodevelopmental disorders, ultimately informing more nuanced approaches to child psychiatric practice and policy."

The conceptualization of psychiatric conditions as innate or acquired, biological or psychosocial, genetic or environmental, influences the ascription of both capacity responsibility (the capacity to adapt or adjust oneâ€™s own behavior) and normative responsibility of individuals or the society towards those diagnosed. But findings in the field of epigenetics indicate that the social and physical environment influence how genes are expressed. Indeed, epigenetics may shed a new light on distinctions such as innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, biological/psychosocial: a far more complex view on neurodevelopmental disorders may emerge, with ethical implications. However, the implications of epigenetics for discussions on the scope and extent of normative responsibility have not been adequately addressed. NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to investigate the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders. We will use theoretical and empirical methods to investigate how certain concepts (innate/biological/genetic) affect the ways in which professionals and stakeholders (persons with a neurodevelopmental disorder and their families) conceive of responsibility. We will evaluate how the emerging field of epigenetics alters the ascription of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility. We will research how individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)and their families experience the interaction between their condition and their biological and social environment. Finally, we will define moral responsibility in light of the emerging field of epigenetics in the area of neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychiatric practice.",
