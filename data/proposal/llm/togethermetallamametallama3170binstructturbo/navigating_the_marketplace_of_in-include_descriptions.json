        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal supports the Navigator project, a comprehensive investigation of the complex landscape of country performance indicators (CPIs) in global governance. Despite the promise of data-driven policy decision-making, the proliferation of CPIs has created a paradox: while each indicator aims to simplify complexity, their abundance generates ambiguity and complicates policy choices. The project addresses a critical knowledge gap by examining how private and public bodies navigate policy fields with multiple, competing indicators. Focusing on four key areas – education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness – Navigator develops a novel framework to analyze the \"marketplace of indicators\" and track the evolution of user and producer practices over time. By shifting the research focus from individual CPIs to the broader dynamics of the indicator marketplace, Navigator aims to advance our understanding of how CPIs influence policy decisions and how their limitations can be addressed. The project's findings will contribute to a more informed and effective use of CPIs in global governance, ultimately enhancing policy outcomes in critical areas."

States are now measured and ranked on a dizzying array of cross-cutting metrics. Prima facie, the era of indicators promises a revolution: armed with ever improving data, policymakers can better allocate scarce resources to address global challenges. Yet, the era of indicators generates a problem and a paradox: while each individual CPI strives to simplify complexity, an abundance of CPIs on the same issue multiplies complexity and thus generates ambiguity. Moreover, while it would be reassuring if we could assume only the soundest CPIs would thrive, many high-profile CPIs remain in widespread use despite well-known shortcomings.Crucially, the paradox begets a major puzzle that prior research has yet to consider: How do private and public bodies navigate policy fields populated with multiple indicators, each portending to measure the same phenomenon? Although prior research provides firm grounds to hope that CPI users and producers improve their practices over time, no studies have investigated whether they do. Rendering this gap tractable, Navigator investigates the “marketplace of indicators” in four major policy fields: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Navigator’s novel framework—inspired by the classic liberal theory of the marketplace of ideas—enables the systemic, longitudinal analysis of how users’ and producers adapt their practices over time: Whether users learn in light of criticism of their favoured CPIs, how they discern when faced with a diversity of CPIs; and how producers compete for users within crowded policy fields. In this way, Navigator would push the frontier of CPI research by conducting a systematic problem shift: from investigating a single CPI’s influence or limitations, to examining how users and producers adapt in the face of growing CPI competition and CPI critique.",
