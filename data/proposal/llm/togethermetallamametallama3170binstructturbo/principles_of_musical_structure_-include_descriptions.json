        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to expand our understanding of human cognition through the lens of music perception. By examining the complexities of auditory sequences and syntactic structures, we aim to uncover the underlying principles that govern musical structure and representation. Our research program is divided into theoretical, computational, and experimental strands. Theoretically, we will develop a novel, unified framework for musical syntax that integrates harmonic and voice-leading constraints, moving beyond the limitations of context-free grammars. Computationally, we will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses and implement our theory using graph grammars and generalized parsing approaches. Experimentally, we will test the predictions of our framework regarding mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependencies, learnability, revision, and tension. Our findings will contribute significantly to the fields of music cognition and cognitive science, advancing our understanding of human cognitive capacities."

The proposed project aims at advancing the understanding of human cognition and, specifically, the capacity to represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures by exploring the rich potential of music perception. Building on the PI’s previous work, this interdisciplinary research programme will be divided into three core strands: (A) The theoretical strand will be devoted to the investigation of formal principles that govern musical syntax and structure building in Western and non-Western music. Many current approaches share the expressive power of (tree-based) context-free grammars and are mostly confined to harmonic syntax only. Therefore, they face difficulty in expressing certain crucial syntactic phenomena in music. To address this lacuna, the theoretical strand will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity and reconciles harmonic structure with the constraints of voice leading within a single coherent framework. (B) Addressing the lack of machine-readable corpora in music research, a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses will be compiled and published in the context of the project’s computational strand. Further, the unified syntax theory will be implemented based on a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars, and trained and evaluated using the analytical corpus. (C) The formal framework developed in (A) entails specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure that will be empirically tested in the experimental strand of the project. Particular focus will be on aspects of nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. The outcomes of the project will make a significant contribution to both the field of music cognition and to the cognitive sciences in general.",
