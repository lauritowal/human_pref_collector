        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe need for sustainable food systems that promote human health, environmental protection, and economic well-being has become increasingly pressing. Despite progress in reducing hunger, the current state of agri-food production, trade, and consumption is causing significant harm to the environment and human health. This project proposes a comprehensive transformation of global food systems through evidence-based research and interdisciplinary analysis. By assessing the health and environmental impacts of food systems worldwide, identifying key threats and opportunities, and evaluating targeted solutions, this project will inform the development of effective and sustainable food systems. A systemic approach will be employed to address complex challenges and overcome existing barriers, providing a framework for policymakers and stakeholders to implement transformative change. Building on a strong track record of interdisciplinary research, this project aims to contribute meaningfully to the achievement of sustainable and healthy food systems globally."

While hunger has receded, food systems are causing increasingly severe damage to our environment and health. The FLORA project will contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption necessary to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems. The project will create essential evidence to identify and implement the shifts in practices and behaviours needed to effectively achieve this transformation, by (1) making a diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, from the production and consumption perspectives, with innovative measures of sustainability, (2) identifying key threats and opportunities with system dynamics and complex network analyses, and (3) targeting and evaluating tailored solutions with an inter-disciplinary modelling framework. The project will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food systems components. Global in scope, it sets the ambitious goal to overcome barriers in current approaches by taking a systemic approach and establishing a robust, interdisciplinary framework supported by empirical advancements to tackle complex food systems challenges. This innovative project builds on the PIâ€™s excellent track record in leading interdisciplinary research focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.",
