        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis research aims to contribute to our understanding of the rising wage inequality in industrialized countries and the persistent gender gaps in the labor market. We focus on the crucial role of firms in shaping these disparities, seeking to identify key drivers and potential solutions. Utilizing comprehensive German social security records spanning four decades, supplemented by survey and administrative data, this project explores three primary research questions. \n\nFirst, we investigate the impact of market forces, particularly increased product market competition and technological advancements, on the widening wage disparities between firms. Second, we examine how government policies, such as minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes, affect wage inequality across firms. Third, we analyze the effectiveness of firm-provided family-friendly policies in reducing gender inequality and explore how the firm environment influences mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth. \n\nOur findings will provide critical insights into the mechanisms driving wage inequality and gender disparities, enabling policymakers and firms to develop targeted interventions to address these pressing issues. By shedding light on the interplay between market forces, government policies, and firm practices, this research aims to inform evidence-based strategies for promoting greater equality in the labor market."

Furthermore, substantial inequality between men and women persists in all industrialised countries, and a large part of the gender gaps observed today is attributable to the arrival of children. In this proposal, we put firms at the centre of the analysis and ask the following questions: First, which market forces can (partly) explain the increasing wage inequality between firms? Second, how do government policies alter the wage structure? And third, how do firm policies and the firm environment impact on gender inequality? All projects draw on four decades of German social security records comprising the near universe of workers and establishments, which we augment with survey and administrative data on firms. In Project A, we investigate how two important market forces, increased product market competition and routine-biased technological change, contributed to the increasing wage inequality between firms, by changing which firms operate in the market (selection) and how employment is distributed across low and high productivity firms (reallocation), and by differentially affecting wage growth across firm types (differential wage growth). In Project B, we study how two prominent government policies, the introduction of a minimum wage and changes in business tax rates, affect wage dispersion between firms through selection, reallocation and differential growth effects. In Project C, we first analyse whether firm provided family-friendly policies, most notably flexible working times and child care facilities, can be effective at reducing gender inequality. We then investigate how the firm environment, specifically the presence of co-workers who are likely to have a working mother and hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, shapes mothersâ€™ return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.",
