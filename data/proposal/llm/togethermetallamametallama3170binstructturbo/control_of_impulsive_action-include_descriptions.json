        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nImpulsive actions often arise from a failure to regulate impulses, resulting in various clinical and behavioral disorders. Despite the importance of understanding impulse-control mechanisms, fundamental questions remain unanswered due to a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory control. This research program aims to address the knowledge gap by investigating the multifaceted nature of impulsive action and executive control. By exploring five key questions, we will elucidate the role of task-preparation stages, negative emotions, learning, functionality, and individual differences in impulsivity. Utilizing a combination of behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures, and mathematical modeling, we will develop a comprehensive model of impulsive action. Our goal is to transform the field by introducing a detailed, multifaceted model that explains impulsivity and control across various contexts. This new understanding will contribute to the development of novel interventions for impulse-control deficits and related disorders, ultimately benefiting individuals and society as a whole."

Failures to regulate impulsive actions have been associated with a variety of clinical and behavioural disorders. Therefore, establishing a good understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and how to improve them could be hugely beneficial for both individuals and society at large. Yet many fundamental questions remain unanswered. This stems from a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory control and well-practiced actions. To make significant progress, we need to develop new models that integrate different aspects of impulsive action and executive control. The proposed research program aims to answer five fundamental questions. (1) Can novel impulsive actions arise during task-preparation stages?; (2) What is the role of negative emotions in the origin and control of impulsive actions?; (3) How does learning modulate impulsive behaviour?; (4) When are impulsive actions (dys)functional?; and (5) How is variation in state impulsivity associated with trait impulsivity? To answer these questions, we will use carefully designed behavioural paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (e.g. facial EMG), and mathematical modelling of decision-making to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions. Our ultimate goal is to transform the impulsive action field by replacing the currently dominant ‘inhibitory control’ models of impulsive action with detailed multifaceted models that can explain impulsivity and control across time and space. Developing a new behavioural model of impulsive action will also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of individual differences in impulsivity and the many disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.",
