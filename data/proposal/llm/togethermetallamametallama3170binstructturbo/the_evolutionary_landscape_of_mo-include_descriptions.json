        "**Title: Unveiling the Ancient Roots of Human Evolution**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nRecent breakthroughs in fossil discoveries, dating, and genomic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of human origins, solidifying Africa as the birthplace of Homo sapiens. However, these findings also point to a more complex, deeper past, spanning nearly three-quarters of a million years. Our proposed research, NGIPALAJEM, aims to explore this extended timeline, which encompasses profound climatic and ecological shifts in Africa. Focusing on the critical period from 1.4 million years ago, we will investigate the interplay between human evolution and environmental changes.\n\nOur multi-faceted approach involves extensive fieldwork in Turkana to expand the scarce hominin fossil record, coupled with a comprehensive analysis of the large vertebrate fossil record. By employing innovative eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic techniques, we will shed light on the dynamics of ecological communities and the potential impact of human predation on modern African faunas. Moreover, we will apply cutting-edge morphometric and analytical methods to the African hominin fossil record, revealing new insights into human phenotypic diversity over the past million years.\n\nBy addressing these knowledge gaps, our research will provide a more nuanced understanding of human evolution within the broader context of African ecological history, ultimately rewriting the narrative of our species' origins."

New fossils, dates and genomic studies have consolidated our African origin. Yet, they also indicate a deeper past, involving multiple events. These events stretch to nearly three quarters of a million years ago (Ma), and take the problem of modern human origins into an entirely different climatic and ecological context. From 1.4 Ma, climate dynamics changed, initiating a 1 million-year period (EMPT) during which, besides greater climatic variability, there is a prolonged arid phase, profoundly affecting African environments. By the end of the EMPT, the structure of the large mammal community in East Africa had changed significantly. The first modern humans are part of this change. The recognition of this older, drier context for the evolution of our species drives NGIPALAJEM. The proposed research aims to establish major empirical benchmarks to answer big questions. First, building on new hominin discoveries in Turkana, NGIPALAJEM will undertake extensive fieldwork to add more specimens to the scarce hominin fossil record of this period. Second, it will increase the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana, and carry out inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses to throw light on the wider evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities, and investigate the role human predation may have played in shaping modern African faunas. Third, new fossils, such as the new small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins that will be described as part of the project, show that the range of hominin phenotypic diversity in the MP is greater than expected, and so novel morphometric and analytical techniques will be applied to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The outcomes of NGIPALAJEM will bring a new understanding of how the evolution of our species is part of a broader and longer African evolutionary landscape.",
