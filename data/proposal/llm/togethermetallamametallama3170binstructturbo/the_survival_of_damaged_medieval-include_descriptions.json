        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"Reevaluating Devotion and Destruction: A Multidisciplinary Study of Polychromed Christian Images in the Nordic Countries.\" This project seeks to investigate the complex and often tumultuous history of richly painted and gilded Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Focusing on approximately 150 wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces that have survived the Reformation, we aim to uncover the extent to which these objects have been intentionally damaged or mutilated. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies from the natural sciences, we will create a comprehensive analytical framework to examine the material properties of these objects, shedding light on the causes of damage and loss. Our research will challenge prevailing narratives about the preservation of medieval devotional objects in the Lutheran tradition and provide essential insights for the future care and conservation of these cultural heritage artifacts. The project's findings will have significant implications for the fields of art history, conservation, and cultural heritage management, informing training priorities and cross-cultural debates about the value and preservation of religious heritage in the Nordic region."

How have wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces transformed from potent objects of devotion to cultural heritage? To what extent is this category of cultural heritage at risk? Values attached to Catholic devotional objects have fluctuated dramatically since Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway declared a break with the church in Rome (1527 and 1537, respectively). However, documentary sources shed little light on changes in status, volatility, and repairs. POLYCHROME will take an ambitious leap that scholars concerned with polychromy in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been reluctant to make: to determine the extent to which losses of noses, eyes and limbs are tied to iconoclastic acts. To date, historians and most conservators have attributed damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism, but not to targeted violence. This is due in part to a lack of archival evidence, but also because secondary paints often mask critical information on surfaces and in internal structures. POLYCHROME will harness technologies from the natural sciences to create, from the ground up, the first analytical overview of c. 150 polychromed objects that are (or potentially were) partially mutilated. The material data will offer essential foundations for determining whether damages and losses can be linked to violence, accidents or inherent weakness. The data will guide the mapping of restorations and repairs, and will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates about heritage values and the future care of religious heritage in the Nordics. The outcomes will complicate conversations about the preserving effects of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects, and will influence training priorities for years to come.",
