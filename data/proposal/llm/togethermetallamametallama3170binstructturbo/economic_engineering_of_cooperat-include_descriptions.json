        "**Title: Harnessing Cooperation in Modern Markets and Societies through Economic Engineering**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nEffective cooperation is vital for the prosperity of economies and societies, but the pursuit of individual interests can often lead to detrimental outcomes. Recent technological advancements in market design and trading strategies present both challenges and opportunities for promoting cooperation. This project employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining experimental methods and behavioral game theory, to address pressing cooperation problems in modern markets and societies.\n\nThe proposed research is structured into three work packages, each focusing on a distinct challenge: (1) designing electronic reputation mechanisms to foster cooperation in digital environments, (2) developing mechanisms to prevent wasteful speed-based competition in financial and electricity markets, and (3) creating markets that align with ethical considerations, such as kidney exchange and pollution rights trading. By exploring these critical issues, this project aims to generate valuable insights for improving the functioning of modern markets and advancing the fields of cooperation and behavioral economic engineering. The outcomes of this research will have significant implications for policymakers, market designers, and scholars, ultimately contributing to the development of more cooperative and sustainable economic systems."

Thus, with inappropriate mechanisms to harness self-interest by aligning it with the common good, the outcome of social and economic interaction can be bleak and even catastrophic. Recent advances in computer technology lead to radical innovation in market design and trading strategies. This creates both, new challenges and exciting opportunities for “engineering cooperation”. This project uses the economic engineering approach (as advocated by Alvin Roth) to address some of the most pressing cooperation problems of modern markets and societies. I propose three work packages, each using innovative experimental methods and (behavioral) game theory in order to address a specific challenge: The first one studies the design of electronic reputation mechanisms that promote cooperation in the digital world. Previous research has shown that mechanisms to promote trust on the Internet are flawed. Yet, there is little empirical and normative guidance on how to repair these systems, and engineer better ones. The second studies the design of mechanisms that avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial and electricity market trading. Traders use algorithmic sniping strategies, even when they are collectively wasteful and seriously threatening market liquidity and stability. Yet, little is known about the robust properties of alternative market designs to eliminate sniping. The third one studies how to design modern markets that align with ethical considerations. People sometimes have a distaste for certain kinds of modern transactions, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights. Yet, little is known about the underlying nature and robustness of this distaste. My project will generate important knowledge to improve the functioning of modern markets, and at the same time open new horizons in the sciences of cooperation and of “behavioral economic engineering”.",
