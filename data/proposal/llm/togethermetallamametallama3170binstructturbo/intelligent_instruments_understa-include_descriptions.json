        "**Abstract:**\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) rapidly advances in creative capabilities, it challenges our understanding of art, culture, and society. This project investigates the transformative impact of creative AI on human relationships with technology and others through the lens of music. By developing innovative instruments with AI, exploring human-AI collaboration in music, and repurposing sonic instruments as scientific tools, this research aims to foster a deeper public understanding of AI's influence on our lives.\n\nThis interdisciplinary endeavor brings together experts from diverse fields to explore the intersection of intelligent instruments, embodied technologies, and societal implications of AI. The project seeks to establish a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving notions of self, others, and knowledge in the context of creative AI. By leveraging open science methods and building on the PI's expertise in music, philosophy, computer science, and AI, this research will contribute to the development of a human-centered approach to AI design and ethical principles for its integration in services and products.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to spark a public discourse on the role of creative AI in shaping our collective future, while providing a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the fields of AI, music, and the humanities. By exploring the frontiers of AI-driven creativity, this research will shed new light on the complex interplay between technology, society, and human experience."

But what does this mean? How does creative AI change our notions of art, culture and society? As new machine learning technologies begin to mirror ourselves, we need to look into that mirror and ask how this is changing us. This project takes a pioneering leap in research about AI by answering how new creative AI transforms our relationships with technology and other people. This ambitious vision is achieved by using music as a platform to establish public understanding of AI. Three respective work packages will develop: 1) instruments with creative AI; 2) human-AI collaboration in music; and 3) sonic instruments as scientific instruments. The project initiates a public discourse on creative AI and develops a theoretical framework describing the transformed notions of self, others and knowledge when we adopt intelligent instruments in our work. INTENT is interdisciplinary in nature. Applying the methodology of our new research collaboration protocol, we summon researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct frontier science on intelligent instruments as boundary objects. Through open science methods the outcomes will address: a) the role of creative AI in embodied technologies, and b) the understanding and reflection of artificial intelligence in future society. The PI is an established authority on new instruments and music software development. His interdisciplinary background in music, philosophy and computer science and AI, together with impactful academic leadership roles make him uniquely placed to lead this radical research programme. Grounded equally in technology development and the humanities, the project will benefit diverse disciplines by developing a theoretical framework of creative AI, initiating a discourse around human-centred creative AI, and defining principles of ethical AI design in services and products.",
