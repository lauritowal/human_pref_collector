        "**Title:** Rethinking Jewish Modernization through Early Modern Translations\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nChallenging conventional notions of modernity as a radical break with tradition, this project reexamines the complex dynamics of Jewish cultural transmission during the early modern period. By focusing on the largely overlooked corpus of non-Jewish texts translated into Jewish languages, we will uncover the intricate processes of intercultural exchange that shaped Jewish culture from the 16th century onwards. Jewish translators actively mediated between their sources and their own agendas, creating a distinctively Jewish yet cosmopolitan literary landscape. This comprehensive study will be the first to systematically explore the vast array of early modern Jewish translations, revealing unexpected interactions between East and West, tradition and innovation, and Christian and Jewish cultures. By positing translation as the primary mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer, we aim to revolutionize our understanding of Jewish modernization and the \"Jewish book,\" highlighting its collaborative, innovative, and porous nature. This research will provide a new paradigm for understanding the intricate dynamics of cultural exchange in early modern Europe and the emergence of Jewish modernity."

This massive upheaval is said to have shaken the very foundations of every culture it frequented, subsequently eliminating the world which once was, to make way for a new age. This project offers a new understanding of modernization, not as a radical break with tradition, but as the careful importation of new ideas by often timid, almost inadvertent innovators. The project focuses on the rich corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which developed during the early modern period. Largely neglected by modern scholars, these translations played a pivotal role in fashioning Jewish culture from the sixteenth century into modern times. Jewish translators were never merely passive recipients of their non-Jewish sources; they mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, and harnessed their sources to meet their own unique agendas. Throughout the process of translation then, a new corpus was created, one that was distinctly Jewish in character, but closely corresponded with the surrounding majority culture. JEWTACT offers the first comprehensive study of the entire gamut of these early modern Jewish translations, exposing a hitherto unexplored terrain of surprising intercultural encounters which took place upon the advent of modernity—between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. The project posits translation as the primary and most ubiquitous mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer in early modern Europe. In so doing, I wish to revolutionize our understanding of the so-called early modern “Jewish book,” revealing its intensely porous, collaborative and innovative nature, and to offer a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange.",
