        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to advance our understanding of knowledge generation and validation in large scientific collaborations, with a focus on particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). By leveraging cutting-edge digital humanities tools, we will analyze internal communication records, such as emails and wiki pages, to characterize collective research processes from a bird's-eye view. This approach will enable a comprehensive understanding of epistemologically relevant aspects of collaboration dynamics. The project aims to develop transferable historiographic guidelines for future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations and contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, particularly in the context of network epistemology. By harnessing the power of digital tools and computational methods, we can overcome previous limitations in studying complex research processes and gain a more nuanced understanding of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond. The project's findings and methodological guidelines will provide a valuable resource for historians and philosophers of science, ultimately enhancing our understanding of how knowledge is produced and validated in contemporary scientific collaborations."

The project will focus on an investigation of recent research practice in particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in order to gain a better understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in very large scientific collaborations. The main working hypothesis of the project is that collective research processes can be characterized, in epistemologically relevant terms, through a bird’s eye view analysis of the collaboration’s internal communication. The internal communication will be reconstructed from born-digital documents (e-mails, internal wiki pages, etc.) which accrue in the research practice of the collaboration. Abstracting from the case study, the project will also develop historiographic guidelines that can be transferred to future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations. Last but not least, the project will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, in particular to recent issues in “network epistemology”, by adapting the theoretical models to better fit important real-world cases. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to capture large-scale and complex research processes, such as the ones at CERN, and make them accessible for epistemological analysis. Almost all the studies of the research practice at CERN or similar cases have so far been restricted to the analysis of published articles, selected interviews and participant observation. Accompanied by historiographic guidelines and practical strategies (both of which are lacking at the moment) for best practices in the history and philosophy of science based on born-digital sources, the application of digital tools and computational methods may finally help us attain a maximally comprehensive picture of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond.",
