        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal**\n\nThis ERC Proof of Concept grant aims to translate cutting-edge research on novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators into a user-friendly software toolbox. The proposed toolbox will enhance the reliability of economic forecasts by incorporating a new family of models that utilize high-frequency information, real-time monitoring capabilities, and innovative predictive breakdown tests. These features are crucial for generating trustworthy forecasts, particularly in times of economic instability.\n\nIn collaboration with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, this project will focus on developing a software package that is accessible to decision-makers in government, finance, and industry. The proposed toolbox will provide a three-dimensional graphical representation of monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, enabling users to make informed decisions based on robust economic forecasts.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to equip policymakers, financial institutions, and businesses with a powerful tool that can improve the accuracy of economic forecasts, leading to more prudent economic policy-making and positive impacts on economic growth, social welfare, and individual well-being. By bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications, this project has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of economic forecasting."

In the ERC-funded starting grant (ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests) we developed novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators (such as economic activity, financial volatility and others) as well as evaluating the reliability of model predictions. In many cases our methods improve upon the current-state-of-art. The idea of this ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant is to use these novel models and tests to develop a software/toolbox that forecasts and monitors economic indicators. Most available forecasting software lack real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests which are important for reliable forecasts especially in periods of instability. Our forecasting and monitoring toolbox can improve the reliability of forecasts as follows: (1) using a novel family of models and high frequency information (2) monitoring forecasts in real-time (3) using new predictive tests of potential breakdowns. Such economic forecasts are at the heart of economic decision making made by governments, Central Banks, and firms that are potential users of our toolbox. In this ERC PoC we will initially work with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, given contacts have already been established, in order to examine various aspects of the development of this toolbox such as: building a user-friendly software, developing a three-dimensional graphical representation of the monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, and generally making our new methods accessible to decision makers. The overall objective of this ERC PoC grant is to provide a software with innovative techniques that can improve economic forecasts and thereby economic decision making. Reliable economic forecasts can lead to prudent economic policy making and affect the growth, economic and social welfare of countries, firms and individuals.",
