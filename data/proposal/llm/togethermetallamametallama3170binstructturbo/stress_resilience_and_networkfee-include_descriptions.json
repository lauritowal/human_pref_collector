        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of acute stress on higher-order cognition. Despite knowledge of the cellular effects of stressors, a significant gap remains in understanding how these effects translate to large-scale neural systems. To address this, we propose a novel framework centered on dynamic shifts in resource allocation across neural networks in response to acute stress. We will employ cutting-edge network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, and mobile applications to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of these shifts and identify predictors of resilience in everyday life.\n\nWe will then validate these findings in a patient group with heightened stress sensitivity, and investigate the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in generating rapid network shifts. Additionally, we will examine how network balance affects cognitive functions and develop a functional MRI-based neurofeedback intervention to train stress-sensitive individuals to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress.\n\nUpon completion, this project promises to deliver: 1) novel insights into the neural adaptations to acute stress; 2) ecologically validated biomarkers of stress resilience and sensitivity; and 3) a potentially transformative method for enhancing stress resilience. By bridging the gap between cellular effects and large-scale neural systems, this project will significantly advance our understanding of the interplay between stress and cognition, with far-reaching implications for mental health research and treatment."

Repeated exposure to stressors is furthermore a critical transdiagnostic factor in etiology, relapse, and chronification in almost all psychiatric disorders. We know from animal work at the cellular level how stressors trigger a neurochemical cascade that alters properties of widespread neuronal populations. A critical gap in our knowledge, however, is how such cellular effects translate to the level of large-scale neural systems which implement higher-order cognition. Here, I propose a novel framework for understanding such alterations as shifts in network balance: I hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at the level of large-scale networks. First, I will leverage recent advances in network connectivity modeling to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of such shifts during acute stress and recovery. Using wearable biosensors and mobile applications, I aim to identify which neural markers predict resilience to stress in real life. Second, I will cross-validate these markers in a patient group characterized by high stress sensitivity. Third, to investigate how rapid network shifts are generated, I will examine the distinct roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems. Fourth, I will test the hypothesis that cognitive functions supported by one network can be disrupted by shifting balance towards another. Finally, I will develop a network-based implementation of functional MRI neurofeedback to train stress-sensitive participants to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. When successful, this project will yield 1) unprecedented insight into how our brain adapts to acute stress; 2) novel ecologically validated transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience versus sensitivity; and 3) a potentially groundbreaking method for training stress resilience.",
