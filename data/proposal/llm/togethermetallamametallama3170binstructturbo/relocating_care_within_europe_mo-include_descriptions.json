    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the phenomenon of care relocation, where elderly individuals from Western Europe are transferred to care facilities in Central Eastern Europe, driven by significantly lower care costs. Through a multi-sited anthropological study, we will examine the experiences of care homes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary that cater to patients from Austria and Germany. By investigating the daily lives of care recipients, the business dynamics of care entrepreneurs, and the historical context of these regions, we aim to understand the complex transnational entanglements of welfare states that arise from care relocation.\n\nOur research will delve into the social, economic, and cultural implications of this trend, which has been described as 'grandmother deportation' or 'geriatric colonialism.' By analyzing the interplay between care providers, state insurances, and regional migration patterns, we will shed light on the consequences of care relocation for individuals, communities, and societies. This project seeks to contribute to a nuanced understanding of what it means to age and require care in an increasingly interconnected Europe, where the boundaries between national welfare systems are becoming increasingly blurred."

This project looks at the reverse phenomenon: care relocation, in which the ageing body is relocated to places where care is more affordable. This hotly contested trend, described as ‘grandmother deportation’ or ‘geriatric colonialism’, can be seen as an extreme example of the marketization of care, and entangling welfare states as entitlements are carried across national borders within Europe. This multi-sited anthropological study will take as case studies care homes in Central Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) that recruit patients from Austria and Germany, and offer care at roughly one-third of the cost of similar institutions in the home countries. What does care relocation do to the people and places involved? Most of these care homes are located in regions characterized by a long German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, adding historical complexity to the story. Some serve only German-speaking patients, others serve local, wealthier elderly people as well. They are run by former migrant care workers and by international companies, bringing labour migration and real estate investment into the picture. ReloCare breaks new ground by encompassing all of these aspects in one study. Alongside in-depth ethnographic studies of daily life in these care homes, the researchers will investigate the nexus of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and the histories of places and regional migration, providing an understanding of these new transnational entanglements of welfare states. In perceiving care relocation as both part of future making and a response to the privatization of care landscapes in the region, it asks what it means to become old and in need of care in an increasingly intertwined Europe.",
