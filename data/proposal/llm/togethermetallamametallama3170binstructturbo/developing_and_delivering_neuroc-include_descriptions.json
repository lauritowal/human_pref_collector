        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to bridge the gap between cognitive science and systems neuroscience by developing innovative methods and tools that integrate brain function and mental behavior. The goal is to advance our understanding of the neural basis of higher cognitive functions, crucial for understanding mental processes and developing effective treatments for neurological disorders. The proposed project combines experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, and in vivo neuroimaging to investigate complex mental behaviors and map neural systems. Two main activities will be pursued: (1) converging methods by simultaneously employing neuroscience and cognitive techniques to achieve a unified understanding, and (2) developing novel neurocomputational models that formalize the connection between brain and cognition. These models will retain the ability to simulate detailed cognitive behavior while reflecting systems-level neuroanatomy and function, enabling a deeper understanding of the mind-brain relationship. By securing the missing link between cognitive science and systems neuroscience, this project will make a significant contribution to the field of cognitive-clinical neuroscience and have a lasting impact on the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders."

This is crucial, scientifically, if we are to understand the nature of mental processes and how they arise from neural machinery but also, clinically, if we are to establish the basis of neurological patients’ impairments, their clinical management and treatment. Cognitive-clinical neuroscience depends on three ingredients: (a) investigating complex mental behaviours and the underlying cognitive processes; (b) mapping neural systems and their function; and (c) methods and tools that can bridge the gap between brain and mental behaviour. Experimental psychology and behavioural neurology has delivered the first component. In vivo neuroimaging and other allied technologies allow us to probe and map neural systems, their connectivity and neurobiological responses. The principal aim of this ERC Advanced grant is to secure, for the first time, the crucial third ingredient – the methods and tools for bridging systematically between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. The grant will be based on two main activities: (i) convergence of methods – instead of employing each neuroscience and cognitive method independently, they will be planned and executed simultaneously to force a convergence of results; and (ii) development of a new type of neurocomputational model - to provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. Computational models are used in cognitive science to mimic normal and impaired behaviour. Such models also have an as-yet untapped potential to connect neuroanatomy and cognition: latent in every model is a kind of brain-mind duality – each model is based on a computational architecture which generates behaviour. We will retain the ability to simulate detailed cognitive behaviour but simultaneously make the models’ architecture reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function.",
