        "**Title: Inequality-Aware Market Design: A Mechanism-Design Framework for Optimal Marketplace Structure**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to develop a novel theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), addressing the challenge of designing marketplaces that account for underlying inequalities between participants. Unlike traditional economic intuition, which prioritizes allocative efficiency, IMD acknowledges that policymakers often face trade-offs between efficiency and redistributive goals. By employing a mechanism-design framework, this research aims to identify the optimal market structure that balances welfare weights reflecting redistributive preferences with the private information of market participants. The project's central hypothesis posits that, under certain conditions, sacrificing allocative efficiency may be necessary to achieve a more equitable distribution of surplus. This study will investigate the validity and scope of this hypothesis, providing policy guidance on the use of distortionary market interventions to address inequality. By integrating redistributive objectives into market design, IMD offers a fresh perspective on addressing inequality, complementing traditional approaches to redistribution through taxation."

Yet, traditional economic intuition opposes these sorts of policies because—unlike well-functioning markets—they introduce allocative inefficiency. In this project, I will explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). My approach is to deploy a mechanism-design framework that identifies the optimal way to structure the market. In the baseline framework, the designer maximizes a welfare function whose welfare weights reflect her redistributive preferences induced by the inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information both about their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. Research will focus on testing the validity and scope of the main hypothesis: When inequalities are sufficiently pronounced and can be detected based on agents’ behavior in the market, it becomes optimal to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable split of surplus. For example, optimal market designs may involve inefficient rationing. Inequality-aware Market Design provides a novel way to address the growing problem of inequality in market-design settings. The redistributive objective distinguishes this theory from the traditional mechanism-design literature that has focused predominantly on efficiency and revenue as design goals; the focus on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace complements the public-finance approach to redistribution through the tax system. IMD provides policy guidance by explaining whether and how policymakers concerned about inequality should resort to distortionary market interventions.",
