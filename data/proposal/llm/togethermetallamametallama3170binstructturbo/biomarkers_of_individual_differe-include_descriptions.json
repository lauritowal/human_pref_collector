        "**Title:** Investigating the Interplay between Physiological State, Personality, and Visual Perception\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nDespite significant advances in understanding the human visual system, little is known about the underlying factors that influence individual differences in visual perception. This project, PUPILTRAITS, aims to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the intricate relationships between physiological state, personality traits, and visual processing. By combining cutting-edge techniques, including advanced pupillometry and ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the human visual cortex, this research will investigate how differences in visual perception are associated with distinct personality profiles and behavioral characteristics.\n\nBuilding on preliminary data, this study predicts that correlations between personality traits and visual processing patterns will provide novel biomarkers for identifying perceptual styles, even in young children. Additionally, a physiological intervention (ketosis) will be used to examine changes in perception within individuals, shedding light on the malleability of early visual processing and its relationship to metabolic state. The findings of this project have the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, such as Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and inform the development of innovative diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches that leverage the interplay between physiology, perception, and behavior."

We know in detail the fundamental steps leading to visual perception, but we do not know why normally sighted people differ in how they perceive: why some “see the forest before the trees”, while others have a fragmented perceptual experience focused on local features. PUPILTRAITS aims to fill this gap by taking an innovative approach to vision science, to understand how vision is affected by physiological state and personality traits. I will measure visual processing with both classic and new methods (that I helped develop), including pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance of human visual cortex, and psychophysics. Based on solid pilot data, I predict that differences in behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits, providing new reliable biomarkers of the local context-independent perception associated with autistics traits, even in young children (using pupillometry). These tools will also reveal changes of perception within individuals: during a safe and simple physiological intervention (ketosis, a metabolic state that can be naturally induced by fasting and intense physical activity), to show that early visual processing can be altered by acting on metabolism, and that this consequently affects holistic/local perceptual styles. My aim is to provide new knowledge on the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing and perception. This has the potential for a strong societal impact: it can change our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, like Autistic Spectrum Disorders, characterized by a different way of processing incoming information; it can aid their diagnosis through objective evaluation of perceptual styles, and encourage innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at changing perception and behavior by acting on general physiology: how we eat and exercise",
