        "**Abstract:**\n\nAddressing health inequality remains a pressing societal concern, as its roots often lie in childhood and can persist across generations. The critical period of childhood, marked by rapid growth and development, is particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of multiple, intersecting forms of disadvantage. However, existing research has predominantly focused on social adversity, neglecting the complex interplay between biological, health, neighbourhood, and environmental factors.\n\nThis project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by establishing a unified data infrastructure, integrating life course analyses of multiple layers of childhood adversity in a large, multi-generational cohort. By harnessing advanced methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science, we will systematically investigate the emergence and persistence of health inequality across generations. Our innovative approach will enable the identification of key patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics driving health disparities.\n\nTo translate research findings into actionable public health strategies, we will establish a policy data lab, integrating nationwide policy evidence and simulation models. By redirecting the focus of health inequality research towards the multifaceted nature of childhood adversity, this project aims to inform targeted interventions, ultimately breaking the cycles of disadvantage that perpetuate health inequality."

Childhood is a sensitive period with rapid growth and development, and adversity during this period may have long-lasting health effects. More importantly, multiple forms of adversity intersect with each other, and disadvantaged children are often exposed to adversity across multiple biological, health, social, neighbourhood and environmental layers, but the childhood adversity literature has almost exclusively focused on social adversity. This is a major gap in our understanding, and empirical data which transcends multitude layers of adversity and follows individuals over entire life courses or across generations is lacking. With LAYERS, I am in a unique position to meet this challenge by creating a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of multiple layers of childhood adversity in 2M people over three generations combined with an interdisciplinary fusion of methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a newly developed complex systems framework. This innovative combination of data and methods will allow for a systematic generation of knowledge on the patterns of health inequality that emerge in early life and transcend generations, the mechanisms which generate these patterns, and the dynamics that make them change over time. To translate these insights into actionable public health, LAYERS will establish a real-world policy data lab which integrates evidence from nationwide policies and simulations. Combined, these interconnected elements will redirect the next frontier in health inequality research towards the multiple layers of adversity which generate inequality over the life course and across generations. Ultimately, this will help us break vicious circles of adversity by identifying children and families who would benefit from targeted support.",
