        "Title: Enhancing Democratic Governance through Legislative Analysis\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe increasing polarization of politics worldwide underscores the importance of understanding how divergent perspectives are integrated into effective legislation. Despite the critical role laws play in democratic governance, the relationships between legislative design, creation, and long-term survival remain poorly understood. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by analyzing legislative texts in the US, UK, and EU through advanced computational methods. We aim to answer three key research questions: (1) What core dimensions define legislative design, and how can we quantify these dimensions using textual analysis? (2) What explains variations in legislative design across laws, policy domains, and political systems? (3) Why do some laws endure, while others undergo frequent revisions or radical transformations?\n\nBy focusing on the dimensions of versatility and precision, this project offers a novel perspective on legislative design, enabling the comparison of legislative outputs across domains, systems, and time. Our integrated theoretical framework will advance the field of comparative public policy, while our methodological approach will pioneer the computational analysis of legislative content. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the development of more effective and responsive democratic governance, enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic institutions."

Given the increasingly hostile political climate around the world, solving this task has never been more difficult and more important than today. Yet, despite the crucial relevance of laws for our daily lives and the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic government, our understanding of how the design, creation and long-term survival of legislation are related is still very limited. The DEMOLAW project analyses legislative texts in three different political systems (US, UK, EU) with cutting-edge computational methods to answer three major research questions: (1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law and how can we exploit textual properties of law texts to measure these dimensions empirically? (2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary across laws, policy domains and political systems? (3) How can we explain why some laws are entirely stable over time, while others are constantly adjusted and sometimes transformed fundamentally? The project makes three major contributions. First, it provides an entirely novel conceptual perspective on the design of democratic laws by focusing on two analytical dimensions that are central to any piece of legislation: versatility and precision. This innovative approach allows us, for the first time, to measure and compare the substance of legislative output across and within policy domains, political systems and over time. Second, the project will develop and test an integrated theoretical framework on both the creation and the survival of democratic legislation and thereby advance the theoretical state-of-the-art in comparative public policy. Finally, the projectâ€™s ground-breaking methodological approach will pave the way for a computational analysis of legislative content and will thereby push the boundaries of how we study democratic decision-mak",
