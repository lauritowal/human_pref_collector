        "**Title: Exploring the Rise of Religious Vigilantism in Global South Mega-Cities**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nIn the Global South, rapidly expanding mega-cities face significant challenges in providing essential services and security to their citizens. As state agencies struggle to cope, non-state actors, including religious organizations and vigilantes, have filled the gap by establishing alternative governance structures. This project investigates the emergence and legitimation of these religious vigilantes, focusing on their use of violence and role in maintaining order alongside state actors. Through an ethnographic comparison of Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, we will examine the complex relationships between Christian, Islamic, Afro-Brazilian, and Indigenous religions and the production of authority among vigilante groups. By exploring the intersections of religion, violence, and governance in these contexts, this research aims to shed light on the ways in which mega-city residents confer authority on these groups and the specific roles of different religious traditions in legitimizing vigilantism. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of power dynamics in Global South mega-cities and inform policies aimed at enhancing human security and governance in these regions."

In such contexts, religious organizations and non-state security actors (vigilantes) have merged into alternative governance organizations. The emergence of religious vigilantes suggests a different connection between religion and violence than emphasized in current research on religious fundamentalism and terrorism. While religious vigilantes use violence systematically, they generally do not aim to overthrow the state, nor do they seek a global audience to witness their violence. They operate side-by-side with state actors to maintain order. Major questions are: why do mega-city residents grant these religious vigilantes authority? And what is the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices? SACRASEC will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes in mega-cities of the Global South through an ethnographic comparison of three mega-cities. The case studies focus on Christian and Afro-Brazilian religion in Rio de Janeiro; Christian, Islamic and Indigenous religion in Lagos; and Islamic and Indigenous religion in Jakarta. This comparative focus makes it possible to draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, while also enabling an analysis of the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. This research extends the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology. It will provide critically needed knowledge on the power structures in mega-cities of the Global South, and in so doing will contribute important insights to policies aimed at improving human security.",
