        "**Title:** Investigating Maternal Adaptations in Pregnancy and Postpartum: A Longitudinal Study\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nPregnancy is associated with profound biological changes that facilitate the onset and regulation of maternal behavior. Our previous research has shown significant reductions in cerebral gray matter volume in areas related to social cognition during pregnancy. This project aims to develop a comprehensive model of maternal adaptations by examining changes in brain structure, cognitive performance, and maternal-infant bonding from pre-pregnancy to postpartum. \n\nWe will employ a prospective longitudinal design, collecting neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data from three groups of nulliparous women: those undergoing a full-term pregnancy, those whose same-sex partners are pregnant, and a control group. Our study will investigate the timing and dynamics of brain changes, the impact of environmental and psychological factors, and the identification of metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations. \n\nBy integrating our findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework, we will provide a dynamic and comprehensive characterization of maternal adaptations, shedding light on the complex interactions among different functional domains. This project is innovative and timely, offering a pioneering approach to understanding the biological and psychological changes that occur during pregnancy and postpartum. Our findings will contribute significantly to the development of a longitudinal model of maternal adaptations, with implications for maternal and infant health."

We were the first group to find (1, 2) that pregnancy is associated with consistent, pronounced and long-lasting reductions in cerebral gray matter (GM) volume in areas of the social-cognition network. The aim of BEMOTHER is to develop an integrative model of the adaptations for motherhood that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period by: i) establishing when the brain of pregnant women begins to change and how it evolves; ii) characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding and psychiatric measures; iii) assessing the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors in the maternal adaptations, iv) identifying the metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and v) integrating the previous findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework (RDoC) (3). We will use a prospective longitudinal design at 5 time points (1 pre-pregnancy session, 2 intra-pregnancy sessions and 2 postpartum sessions) during which neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral and metabolomics data will be acquired in 3 groups of women: a group of nulliparous women who will be undergoing a full-term pregnancy, another group of nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo a full-term pregnancy, and a group of control nulliparous women. We will provide the longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, but we will also deliver intermediate longitudinal evaluations after the postpartum session, as well as cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session. BEMOTHER is timely and innovative. It adopts the translational RDoC framework in order to provide a pioneering, comprehensive and dynamic characterization of the adaptations for motherhood, addressing the interaction among different functional domains at different levels of analysis.",
