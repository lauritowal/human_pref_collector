        "**Title: Investigating Intergenerational Communication through a Community Neuroscience Approach**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nEffective communication between individuals of different ages is crucial in our daily lives, yet the neural mechanisms supporting intergenerational interactions remain poorly understood. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by employing a novel 'community neuroscience' approach that integrates laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and interpersonal analyses. We will explore how age-related differences in brain function impact conversational flow, speech processing, and prediction of others' intentions. To address these questions, we will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during co-designed storytelling events, and use this data to inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies. By combining the strengths of naturalistic observations and experimental control, this project will provide new insights into the neural basis of intergenerational communication and develop tools to improve communication across age groups. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between individuals of different ages and facilitate the development of evidence-based strategies to enhance intergenerational communication."

InterCom combines laboratory research with real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal analyses with interpersonal measures (e.g. ‘brain-to-brain synchrony’), to better understand multi-generational communication, both within and beyond family contexts. Do age-related differences in brain rhythms inhibit conversational flow? How do listeners process speech produced by children or older adults? Can intergenerational miscommunications be partly attributed to the fact that children and older adults are less likely to predict what others are about to say? How can we overcome implicit neurobehavioral culprits of misalignment? Curiously, while laboratory studies have shown that there are significant differences in how children, adults, and older adults process (non)verbal information, these and related questions remain largely unanswered. InterCom will test a novel ‘community neuroscience’ approach, one that flows from the real world, to the lab, and back. We will collect brain, body, and language data from socio-culturally diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events that are co-designed with community partners. The data collected during these events will then inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies and vice versa. As such, InterCom leverages the benefits while offsetting the downsides of both naturalistic observations and experimental control, and will innovate on and combine laboratory and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and data analysis in a truly reciprocal manner. Together, InterCom will tread previously uncharted territory in both intergenerational and real-world neuroscience research to generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations.",
