        "**Title: Understanding Flavor Preference Formation and Regulation**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nTransforming human diets is a pressing global priority, but overcoming entrenched preferences for familiar flavors remains a significant obstacle. The process of odor-taste associative learning, which underlies flavor preference formation and retrieval, is poorly understood. This project seeks to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating the cortical mechanisms that enable the transfer of appetitive properties from odors to environmental objects. Through a multi-level approach, we will explore the neural processes that govern the acquisition of new flavor preferences and their regulation by digestive signals.\n\nOur research will focus on three interconnected levels of investigation: (1) identifying the neural code that enables odors to acquire and evoke taste associations, (2) elucidating the cortical mechanisms that facilitate the encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations in variable contexts, and (3) examining the interactions between digestive feedback and the neural coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval. By shedding light on the biological basis of flavor preference formation and regulation, this project aims to inspire the development of novel interventions that promote dietary changes across the lifespan and address maladaptive eating patterns."

Odor-taste associative learning is the principal perceptual support process for flavor preference formation and retrieval. Mechanistic insight into the cortical processes that transfer appetitive properties of an odor from the mouth onto environmental objects is, however, almost completely absent. As a result, fundamental questions about the processes that drive the acquisition of new flavor preferences, and their regulation by signals from the digestive tract, still remain to be answered. OLFLINK will uncover processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth across three nested levels of investigation that are usually studied in separation. In doing so, I propose to discover key factors that facilitate or hinder acquisition of new flavor preferences. Specifically, I will 1: determine the distributed CODE by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (WP1), 2: delineate the cortical CONTROL mechanisms that facilitate encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations in the light of contextual variability (WP2), and 3: determine the interactions with digestive feedback that REGULATE this flexible coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (WP3). This final step especially provides insight into the bodyâ€™s ability to adjust learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and has potential to transform our thinking about the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. The novel insights from OLFLINK will fill the knowledge gap that currently exists between the mechanisms driving perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the outside world, and will inspire the development of novel interventions to facilitate dietary changes over the life course.",
