        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the development and implementation of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to facilitate a successful transition to high school for children who have experienced social difficulties in elementary school. Building on previous research showing that negative social experiences can impede self- and stress-regulation, A.L.I.B.I. aims to enhance children's self-regulation skills and prosocial behavior. In the game, children navigate a virtual high school environment, engaging in prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and thoughtful decision-making to uncover a hidden alien. This innovative approach provides a realistic yet safe space for children to practice social skills and prepare for the challenges of high school. The proposed project will (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a standalone game, (2) assess its effectiveness, (3) integrate it into existing school transition programs in collaboration with school counseling organizations, and (4) develop a marketing strategy for broader implementation in the Netherlands and Europe. By supporting the transition to high school, A.L.I.B.I. has the potential to promote positive social relationships, improved self-regulation, and long-term academic success."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 286 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nOur ERC-team (ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay) has found that poor social experiences with peers (peer rejection, victimization) and teachers (low support or conflictual relations with teachers) during elementary school impede children’s self- and stress-regulation during the elementary school years. The affected self- and stress-regulation places these children at risk of developing similar troublesome relations with teachers and peers after the transition to high school. We propose to develop a serious game named A.L.I.B.I. to help children make a successful transition to high school by increasing children’s self-regulation skills and their prosocial behavior. In A.L.I.B.I. children play in a virtual high school environment. The objective of A.L.I.B.I. is to uncover an alien, who is disguised as a teacher or peer. By engaging in prosocial interactions with teachers and peers, by taking the perspective of others, by learning to overthink multiple response options before acting, and by valuing long term perspectives over short term goals, children will receive clues that will help them to uncover the alien. The advantage of A.L.I.B.I. is that through the use of a virtual school environment, it provides children a realistic yet safe environment to learn and rehearse prosocial behaviors, to prepare them for the new social environment. In addition, A.L.I.B.I. is intuitively attractive for children, through its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer. The proposed ERC PoC grant has the goal to (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game that will be ready for implementation, (2) to the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I., (3) to integrate A.L.I.B.I. in ongoing school transition trainings as provided by three school counseling organizations in three regions in The Netherlands, and (4) to develop a marketing strategy for broader Dutch and European implementation.",
