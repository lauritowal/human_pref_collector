        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal**\n\nThe proposed project, \"Negotiating Sanctity in the Global Catholic Context,\" examines the role of artworks in the process of establishing the sanctity of Catholic blesseds and saints in the post-Tridentine era. This period saw the rise of Iberian empires, and the cult of saints became a crucial battleground between the Catholic Church and Protestantism. By analyzing artworks produced in newly Christianized territories, this project seeks to uncover the ways in which local Catholic communities negotiated their spiritual status within universal Catholicism.\n\nThe research hypothesizes that artworks related to the recognition of saints served as tools for self-representation and social identity formation, revealing the complex dynamics between local and universal Catholicism. By tracing the circulation of material objects and iconographies within global networks of knowledge transmission, this project aims to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world.\n\nCombining art historical analysis with concepts from critical sociology, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the global Catholic context and its cultural and artistic expressions. The findings will have significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between the Roman Curia, local Catholic communities, and the Iberian empires, and will shed new light on the role of art in negotiating sanctity in the early modern period."

As the cult of the saints was among the key conceptual battlegrounds in the conflict between the Catholic church and the Protestants, in the post-Tridentine period, saints came to fulfill spiritual, ideological and propagandistic purposes. Art history has paid heightened attention to the adherence of artworks to the models of sanctity formulated by the Tridentine church, leading to an overall neglect of competing local constructions of sanctity, a shortfall particularly momentous with regard to blesseds and saints connected in different ways to the process of European expansion, specifically to the Iberian empires. The hypothesis under examination is that the artworks produced in relation to gaining recognition by the Church of saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories reveal an underlying negotiation of the local Catholic communities’ spiritual status within universal Catholicism. As official recognition affirmed the society which had made a saint its own, artworks related to this process served purposes of self-representation within the broader framework of social identity formation. GLOBECOSAL traces the circulation of material objects and iconographies within and between global networks of knowledge transmission, and combines this approach with a hypothetical ‘global market of symbolic values’ developed on the basis of concepts from critical sociology. Investigating the negotiation of sanctity between Rome and geographically distant areas participates in ‘globalizing’ the history of early modern art and is qualified to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world at large.",
