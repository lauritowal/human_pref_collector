        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nFostering a Harmonious Multicultural Society through Intergroup Tolerance\n\nAs societies become increasingly diverse, understanding how to coexist peacefully is a pressing concern. Intergroup tolerance, a crucial aspect of harmonious coexistence, remains underexplored in social psychological research. This project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by examining the psychological and social dynamics of intergroup toleration. We aim to investigate four key components: the psychological underpinnings of tolerance, the processes driving its acceptance, the limits of tolerance, and the consequences of being tolerated. By combining survey data, framing experiments, and EEG lab experiments, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of intergroup toleration. This research will provide valuable insights into promoting tolerance and contribute to the development of initiatives that foster a more inclusive society. Given the growing importance of cultural diversity and the lack of systematic social psychological research, this project is both innovative and timely."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",
