        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: Exploring the Public Opinion Nexus in Collective Defence Decision-Making**\n\nMilitary alliances often falter when member states fail to uphold collective defence commitments, yet the influence of public opinion on these critical decisions remains poorly understood. This proposed research project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by placing public opinion at the forefront of inquiry into the microfoundations of collective defence. Leveraging innovative approaches from experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, a comprehensive, cross-national study will be conducted in key NATO member states, focusing on individual attitudes towards allied assistance in diverse collective defence scenarios.\n\nThe proposed theoretical model explores the complex interplay between individual attitudes, public opinion, and decision-makers' views, with a particular emphasis on the strategic context's impact on public opinion formation and policy-making. Hypotheses suggest that the nature of the conflict – specifically, whether it falls within a \"grey zone\" or involves direct armed aggression – significantly influences the role of public opinion in shaping decision-makers' views. A novel methodological approach employing immersive mixed-media experiments will be used to examine how attitudes towards defending allies shift under varying conditions.\n\nThe project's findings have the potential to redefine our understanding of military alliance stability and credibility, particularly in the context of the current deteriorating international security environment."

The historical record shows that allied states often do not honour their collective defence commitments, but existing scholarship has not yet explained the role of public views in these high-stakes decisions. The MICROCODE project aims to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence that puts public opinion in allied countries at the centre of inquiry. Building on cutting-edge approaches in experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, I aim to conduct an extensive, cross-national investigation in the key NATO member states, with the views of individuals as the principal unit of analysis. I introduce a complex theoretical model to explain (1) how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios; (2) how these individual attitudes aggregate to form public opinion shaped by societal cues; and (3) how, in turn, public opinion shapes the views of decision-makers in allied states. My main set of hypotheses concerns the critical impact of the strategic context on the formation of public opinion and its relevance for policy-making: I propose that whereas conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression leave a limited role for public opinion, the more ambiguous “grey zone” conflicts potentially open a wide “contestation space” where public views become more polarised, elastic, and simultaneously more relevant for decision-makers. As a methodological innovation, I will use novel immersive mixed-media experiments to create an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for the participants and examine how their attitudes towards defending allies change under different conditions. At a time of dramatic deterioration of the international security environment, the MICROCODE project’s findings could redefine how we view the stability and credibility of military alliances.",
