        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThe development of digital twins of the ocean (DTOs) has the potential to revolutionize ocean science and governance, but their creation and use raise critical questions about power dynamics, data ownership, and the distribution of benefits. As the European Commission builds a prototype DTO, this project aims to address the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with these emerging technologies. By examining the socio-technical making of DTOs in national and international contexts, we will investigate the politics of data access, ownership, and sharing, as well as the norms and values that govern their use.\n\nOur research will focus on three key regions: the European Union, the United States, and China, analyzing the practices, policies, and politics that shape the development and use of DTOs. We will also study the role of DTOs in multilateral negotiations, exploring how these technologies influence decision-making processes and outcomes.\n\nBy re-conceptualizing digital twins as socio-technical relations embedded in specific institutional, political, and economic contexts, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by DTOs. Our methodological approach will combine qualitative and quantitative research methods, providing a comprehensive and interdisciplinary analysis of the complex issues surrounding DTOs. Ultimately, this project aims to inform the development of equitable and effective DTOs that support sustainable ocean futures."

The EU DTO is part of a larger set of substantial global and national efforts to develop highly accurate digital models of the ocean for ‘better decision-making’ and an emerging high-tech knowledge infrastructure that turns various types of ocean data into prediction tools for public and private actors with a stake in the transition towards sustainable ocean futures. However, DTOs, although needed to advance ocean science and governance, are a political issue in themselves. Firstly, DTOs run the risk of perpetuating global inequalities because the capacities to develop, access, and use ocean data, information, and science are unequally distributed. Secondly, DTOs may create an array of legal and political uncertainties regarding data access, ownership, security, and sharing. Thirdly, DTOs should be embedded into a set of norms, rules, and values to prevent abuse and misuse in practice — a neglected aspect in the current ‘twin rush’. TwinPolitics will overcome shortcomings in the study of DTOs by examining both the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes and the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting. TwinPolitics will re-conceptualise digital twins as socio-technical relations operating under a specific set of institutional, political, and economic conditions and within a hybrid research, data, and observation environment. TwinPolitics will break new ground by developing a methodological approach that combines, on the one hand, qualitative and quantitative research on the practices, policies, and politics presiding over digital twins in national/regional contexts (EU, USA, China) with, on the other hand, the study of DTO use during multilateral negotiations.",
