        "**Abstract:**\n\nAdolescent behavior and development are profoundly influenced by peer relationships, with social media amplifying these effects. Despite the significant impact of peer influence, the underlying mechanisms and factors contributing to adolescent susceptibility remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap by developing a novel theoretical framework and computational models to elucidate the role of social information in adolescent behavior. We conceptualize adolescents as active agents seeking social information, and our research aims to investigate when and from whom they seek this information. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, combining behavioral tasks, computational modeling, and neuroimaging, we will examine the neural and hormonal correlates of social learning. Furthermore, we will conduct experimental studies within real-world peer networks to investigate the diffusion of information and the impact of different peer types. Our findings will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of social learning, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to promote positive outcomes and mitigate risk behaviors in adolescents."

More recently, peer influence seems to be amplified by developments in social media (e.g. viral risk-taking challenges). However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms underlying peer influence, or why adolescents are specifically sensitivity. The primary goal of this proposal is to gain insights in the role of social information in adolescent behavior, by developing a new theoretical framework that will be formalized in novel computational models. First, in contrast with previous accounts, adolescents are not treated as the passive receivers of social information, but considered as agents that play an active role in searching for social information. This search revolves around two main questions: when to search for social information, and who to learn from. To track development in social learning strategies I will develop novel tasks to investigate (1) when, and how much, social information is searched for, and (2) who adolescents will go to. Second, I will employ computational models in combination with functional magnetic imaging to gain insight in how brain development, and pubertal hormones are associated with changes in specific computational processes that are involved in social learning. Thirdly, social learning will for the first time be studied experimentally in real peer social networks. Social network analyses will be used to elucidate the impact of different types of peers, and to study the diffusion of information through peer groups. Our findings will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of social learning in the context of real world social networks. Such fundamental knowledge can inform the development of interventions preventing risk or promoting prosocial behavior and educational outcomes.",
