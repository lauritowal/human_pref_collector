        "**Title:** Understanding the Lived Experience of Accountability and Rights in European Prisons\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to investigate how mechanisms for securing rights, ensuring accountability, and upholding the rule of law are experienced in European prisons. By examining the perspectives of prisoners, prison staff, and staff of accountability bodies, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structures and processes in place to ensure fair, transparent, and human rights-compliant decision-making in prisons. Drawing on insights from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, this study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to document and analyze the lived experience of accountability and rights in European prisons. The project will explore how accountability structures reflect and shape penal ideologies and prison regimes, and how these concepts are distinctively 'European' in nature. By shedding light on the practical implementation of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness in prisons, this research aims to inform the development of more effective and rights-respecting penal policies and practices, ultimately contributing to the protection of human rights and the rule of law in the prison context."

Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context.",
