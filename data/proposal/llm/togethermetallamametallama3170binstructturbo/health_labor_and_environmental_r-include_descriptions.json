        "**Title: Enhancing Environmental Policy with Advanced Impact Analysis**\n\nThe European Union has witnessed significant improvements in environmental quality, driven by structural transformations and stringent regulations. Despite these advancements, policy makers continue to prioritize environmental protection due to pressing global concerns, such as climate change, and rising public demand for better environmental quality. This project seeks to contribute innovative tools for assessing the trade-offs between environmental protection and economic growth, focusing on the impacts of fossil fuel combustion on human health and the economy.\n\nBy integrating empirical modeling, causal inference, and chemical transport models, this research aims to provide more accurate estimates of the economic damage caused by air pollution. The project consists of two parts: the first examines the unintended consequences of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme on local air quality, while the second develops a unified framework to analyze the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The ultimate goal is to provide empirical evidence that informs environmental policy-making in the context of climate change and air quality management, with the potential to make a significant impact on global environmental policy."

Notwithstanding such improvements, environmental regulation continues to be a top priority for policy makers in Europe and other post-industrial societies. Global climate change is an important reason for this. Increasing demand for environmental quality is another one, explaining why some of the richest agglomerations in Europe have been adopting very costly measures to further reduce air pollution. Both global climate change and regional air pollution originate to a large extent from the combustion of fossil fuels, an activity that, in Europe, is costly to curb but also causes substantial damage to human health. This project contributes new tools for assessing this trade-off by (i) developing empirical models that greatly enhance spatial detail in state-of-the-art economic impact analysis, (ii) pioneering an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions at the source to chemical transport models for air pollutants, and (iii) incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts of air pollution into economic damage estimates. Part I of the project studies the economic implications of changes in local air quality that were an unintended consequence of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide. Part II analyzes the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration in a unified empirical framework. The key objective of this project is to provide empirical evidence that can inform environmental policy-making in the broad contexts of climate policy and air quality management. Given the ambitious concepts proposed, the global significance of the environmental problems addressed, and the focus on policy, this project has the potential to make a large impact.",
