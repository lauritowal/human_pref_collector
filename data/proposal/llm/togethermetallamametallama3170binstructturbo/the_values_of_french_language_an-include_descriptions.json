        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project explores the intersection of language and identity in medieval Europe, focusing on the role of French as a transnational language between 1100-1450. By examining the complex linguistic landscape of the time, we aim to challenge traditional narratives of national languages and instead highlight the significance of multilingualism and supralocal languages, such as Latin and French, in shaping European identity. Our case study centers on L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César, a widely disseminated textual tradition that offers a unique window into medieval understandings of European history and identity.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary collaboration involving scholars from Europe and North America, we will draw on expertise in codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology to reevaluate the cultural and historical significance of French as a lingua franca. By doing so, we hope to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages and to stimulate reflection on the complex relationships between language, identity, and nationhood. Our project builds on prior critiques of national languages and literary traditions, but offers a fresh, international perspective on the topic, with the ultimate goal of shedding new light on the role of language in shaping European identity."

What is the relation historically between language and identity in Europe? How are cognate languages demarcated from each other? Normative models of national languages helped shape Europe. Yet they did not become hegemonic until the 19th century. Indeed, they were imposed (not always successfully) on a linguistic map of Europe more fluid and complex than most histories of national languages allow. In the Middle Ages multilingualism was common, as was the use of non-local languages, notably Latin, but also French. This project undertakes a revaluation of the nature and value of the use of French in Europe during a crucial period, 1100-1450, less in terms of its cultural prestige (the traditional focus of scholarship) than of its role as a supralocal, transnational language, particularly in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The project fosters collaboration between, and cuts across, different intellectual and national scholarly traditions, drawing on expertise in codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology; it involves scholars from a range of European countries and North America, entailing empirical research around a complex and widely disseminated textual tradition vital to medieval understandings of European history and identity, L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César. This case study will ground and stimulate broader speculative reflection on the two core questions concerning linguistic identity. While the project builds on prior critiques of the construction of, and investment in, national languages and literary traditions, it has a broad historical scope, and will offer an innovative, genuinely international perspective, in terms of both its object of study and method. Indeed, its final aim, through and beyond its consideration of French as a lingua franca, is to interrogate that language’s role in the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages.",
