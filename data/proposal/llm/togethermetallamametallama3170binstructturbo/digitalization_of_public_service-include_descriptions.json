        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nEvery year, millions of lives are lost and countless individuals are pushed into extreme poverty due to inadequate access to essential public services in low-income countries. In response, governments worldwide are embracing digital technologies to expand access to public services. However, despite initial optimism, many digitalization projects in low-income countries fail or exacerbate existing inequalities by excluding vulnerable populations with limited connectivity.\n\nThis research proposal seeks to bridge the knowledge gap surrounding the determinants of successful digitalization in the public sector of developing countries and the potential of digital technologies to enhance the efficiency and inclusivity of public service delivery. Through a collaborative effort with local governments and NGOs, this project will conduct four large-scale randomized experiments in countries undergoing public service digitization, including India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The experiments will investigate the impact of digital technologies on both the demand and supply sides of public service delivery, with a focus on promoting more equitable and robust economic growth. The findings will inform public policy, ultimately contributing to improved access to higher-quality public services for a broader segment of the population in low-income countries."

Governments across the globe have responded by adopting digital technologies — e.g., by making services available to citizens virtually — in the hopes of providing broader, faster, and cheaper access to public services. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in this regard, low-income countries continue to struggle with nearly one-third of digitalization projects being abandoned and substantial resources being wasted (World Development Report, 2016). Moreover, even when successful, these digitization projects they risk excluding vulnerable individuals with limited connectivity, potentially widening existing inequalities. This research proposal aims to advance our understanding of (i) the determinants of the success or failure of digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, and (ii) the ways digital technologies can be harnessed to improve the efficiency and inclusion of public service delivery, thereby producing more robust and inclusive economic growth. In collaboration with local governments and NGOs, I will design and carry out four large-scale randomized experiments in countries where public services are being digitized (India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Liberia). In these experiments, I will study digital technologies that influence (i) the demand for public services by allowing citizens to access them digitally, and (ii) the supply of in-person services by remotely monitoring or supervising the delivery agents. The results will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately helping a broader segment of the population access more and higher quality public services.",
