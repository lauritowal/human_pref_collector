        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe 2007 global economic crisis highlighted the critical interplay between real estate, finance, and state institutions. Despite this, the connections between these sectors remain understudied and under-theorized. Existing research has primarily focused on either the finance-state nexus or the real estate-state relationship, often neglecting the other crucial components. This project proposes a novel framework, the real estate/financial complex, to capture the intricate relationships between these sectors and states at various scales, from local to global.\n\nThis project aims to investigate the quantitative and qualitative shifts in real estate, finance, and their interaction across multiple countries and local contexts. An international comparative approach will be employed, with a postdoctoral researcher conducting broad-spectrum research and three PhD students each examining two countries and complementing national mappings with in-depth local case studies. The principal investigator will focus on the qualitative transformation of real estate, finance, and the state's role, as well as the global dimensions and conceptualization of the complex in relation to shifting state-society-market dynamics.\n\nBy bridging the gap between macro and micro perspectives, this project seeks to advance our understanding of the real estate/financial complex and its implications for state institutions, economic stability, and societal well-being."

States and their many institutions have also been seen as complicit to the crisis. The connections between real estate (both residential and non-residential), finance and states still remain under-researched and under-theorized. Work in various political economy traditions has done a great deal of research into the connection between finance and states, but they have often ignored a crucial sector: real estate. There is also a tradition of work focusing on the interaction between real estate and states, usually concentrating on the involvement of municipalities in real estate projects. Finance is often ignored in this tradition. Moreover, this tradition has its roots in urban studies and is very micro focused, while the various political economy traditions are very macro focused. In other words, we not only need a stronger connection between finance and real estate, we also need a stronger connection between different scales: local/urban, national and global. I here propose a new metaphor that can help us to centre attention on the connection between real estate, finance and states: the real estate/financial complex, akin the military/industrial complex. Both complexes should be seen as triangles since states are also part of the equation. A Postdoc will do internationally comparative research on both the quantitative and qualitative shifts towards real estate, finance and their interaction. Three PhD students will focus on two countries each, each complementing two national mappings of the complex with two local/urban case studies. The PI will focus on the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance and the role of the state in this; the global dimensions of the complex; and the conceptualization of the complex in relation to the structural changes in state-society-market relations.",
