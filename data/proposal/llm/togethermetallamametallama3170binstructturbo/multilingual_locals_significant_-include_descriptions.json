        "Title: Rethinking World Literature: A Multilingual and Located Approach\n\nAbstract:\n\nCurrent conceptions of world literature often rely on oversimplified notions of global circulation and a dominant English canon. However, this paradigm neglects the complexities of multilingual literary landscapes. This project seeks to challenge this monolingual straitjacket by exploring the diverse literary geographies of north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia. Through a comparative study of these regions, each with distinct experiences of colonialism, multilingualism, and oral traditions, we aim to develop a more nuanced understanding of world literature as a multifaceted and locally situated phenomenon.\n\nOur research will focus on three critical periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current era of globalization. By examining local transculturations, debates on world literature, and the dynamics of multilingualism, we will highlight the complex interplay between appropriation, co-constitution, and diffusion in shaping literary fields. This project will contribute to the development of a theoretical framework, methods for multilingual research and training, and strategic dialogues with scholars and writers across multiple regions. By recentering the discussion of world literature on its multilingual and local contexts, we aim to create a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of literary production and circulation."

It is mostly in English. Its main genre is the novel.” These are caricatures of how World literature as a set of discourses is shaping the field of literary studies, but in fact Non-Western literatures are positioned with reference to a single global timeline and a single map, and translations supposedly ensure that worthy texts enter the global canon. What does not circulate globally is provincial, not good enough, not “world literature”. This picture bears little resemblance to the multilingual world of literature, which consists not of a single map but of many “significant geographies” specific to language, group, and genre. By exploring the often fractured “multilingual locals” and “significant geographies” of literature in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia—each with different experiences of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and continuing oral traditions—we seek to establish a multilingual and located approach to world literature in place of meta-categories like “global” and “world”. Mindful of older histories and networks of literary multilingualism and critical of the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories that partition Anglophone and Francophone literature from Arabic, Amharic, and Hindi/Urdu, we focus on three periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. We will study local transculturations, local debates on world literature, old and new forms of multilingualism, actors and technologies of print and orality, to highlight dynamics of appropriation rather than imitation, co-constitution rather than diffusion, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories that together form local and transnational literary fields (“world literature”). The project will propose a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues with scholars and writers in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, UK and France.",
