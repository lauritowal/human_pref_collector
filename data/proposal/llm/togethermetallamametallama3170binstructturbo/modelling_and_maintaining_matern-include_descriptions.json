        "Title: Unraveling the Impact of Pregnancy Loss on Maternal Brain Plasticity and Mental Health\n\nAbstract:\n\nPregnancy loss poses significant risks to the mental health of affected women and their families, yet it remains a relatively understudied area in global health. This project aims to investigate the effects of early and late pregnancy loss on maternal brain anatomy and function, with a focus on understanding how motherhood-related changes in the brain are reversed following pregnancy termination. Leveraging expertise in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, we will collect longitudinal data from women who have experienced early miscarriage or stillbirth, including repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessments, and comprehensive mental health monitoring. Whole-genome sequencing of both women and their life partners will be performed, along with detailed surveys, to uncover how individual brain trajectories relate to environmental and genetic risk factors. By integrating existing big data and advanced computational modeling techniques, we will identify unique brain imaging patterns in the context of population norms. This project seeks to reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability and targets for maintaining maternal mental health, ultimately informing strategies to support women's health and the well-being of future offspring."

While we have started to gain insights into how pregnancy shapes the female brain toward motherhood, the impact of the abrupt termination of pregnancy on maternal brain plasticity remains largely unknown. Here, I seek to study traces of unwanted terminated pregnancy following early and late pregnancy loss in the female brain, understanding to what degree motherhood associated changes in brain anatomy and function are formed back when a pregnancy is lost. I aim to identify traces and determinants of afflicted mental health in this period of profound vulnerability and (self-)stigmatization. Leveraging my portfolio of expertise in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, the HealthyMom project will acquire unique longitudinal data of the weeks and months following early miscarriage or stillbirth. Specifically, women will undergo repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessment and a comprehensive monitoring of their mental health. I will perform whole genome sequencing, not only of the women but also of their life partners. Together with detailed surveys, this will allow me to uncover how individual brain trajectories relate to environmental levers for mental health maintenance and to genetic risk factors, including genetic effects of the partners on the women. The project will draw on existing big data and advanced computational modelling techniques to chart individual brain imaging patterns in the context of the population norm. As such, HealthyMom offers unprecedented opportunities to understand female-specific brain dynamics and to reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability as well as targets for maintaining maternal mental health. It has significant implications for womenâ€™s health and (indirectly) the health of future offspring.",
