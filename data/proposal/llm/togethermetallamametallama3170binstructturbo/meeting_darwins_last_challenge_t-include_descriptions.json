        "This interdisciplinary research project seeks to investigate the long-standing hypothesis of a correspondence between the evolution of languages and the genetic history of populations. By integrating cutting-edge methods from formal and typological linguistics with recent advances in genetic analysis, we aim to re-examine the relationship between language transmission and biological evolution. Our approach employs a novel comparative method based on grammatical evidence, ensuring high standards of testability and replicability, and facilitating the measurement of linguistic distances between distant populations. In collaboration with geneticists, we will identify populations of significance for joint language and gene sampling, and utilize genome-wide data and biostatistical methods to analyze DNA diversity and its relationship to linguistic diversity. By bridging the gap between linguistics and genetics, this project has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of human evolution and cultural transmission."

Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994) advocated a correspondence between some proposed language families and classical genetic markers, i.e. between biological evolution and transmission of cultural traits (languages), in agreement with Darwin’s (1859) prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. Their conclusions were variously criticised, and are especially undermined by the weakness of available language classification methods, mainly based on lexical (in a broad sense) material: these are either too narrow in scope (classical method) or probabilistically unreliable (Greenberg’s mass comparison) to provide solid long-range taxonomies to be matched against those of geneticists. We will address such issues with a radically new comparative method (Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) based entirely on grammatical evidence and on recent theoretical advances in formal and typological linguistics. The method ensures unprecedented standards of testability/replicability and can measure linguistic distances between even remote populations. Linguists and biologists will for the first time jointly select the populations most significant from either perspective for language/gene sampling. We will also adopt the newest powerful genetic tools of the last decade, both in terms of data (genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, including uniparentally transmitted markers of the Y chromosome and of mitochondrial DNA) and of biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.",
