        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to explore the intersection of environmental violence and cultural representation, examining how contemporary artists, writers, and filmmakers address the consequences of human actions on the natural world. By analyzing ecologically-charged works and their connections to colonialism, genocide, and other atrocities, we will uncover the historical and structural links between crimes against humanity and crimes against nature. Our research will develop a novel ecological model for understanding violence and its representation, focusing on the emotional resonance and cultural implications of these works. We will also investigate how cultural productions can foster critical self-reflection and empathy, ultimately informing pedagogical strategies for promoting nuanced understandings of environmental crises. By bridging cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, this project aims to revolutionize our understanding of violence, memory, and the human-nature relationship, providing a framework for rethinking the complexities of ecoviolence and its representation in more-than-human terms. The outcome will be a comprehensive guide for integrating cultural representations into educational settings, enabling more effective critical engagement with environmental issues and challenging simplistic narratives of victimhood and perpetratorship."

How do we remember the victims, both human and non-human? And who is to blame? Contemporary culture plays a crucial role in addressing these questions. Large-scale processes like ecocide and extinction pose significant conceptual and representational challenges. This project posits that writers, artists and filmmakers are responding to these challenges by adapting existing repertoires, especially ones that emerged in response to the Holocaust, slavery, and other atrocities. In so doing they reveal the historical, structural and discursive links between crimes against humanity and crimes against nature. EcoViolence will be the first comprehensive, transnational, comparative study of the cultural imaginary of environmental violence. Bringing together recent work in cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will develop an innovative ecological model for the study of violence and its representation. We will document how texts, films, art works, plays and exhibitions represent ecoviolence; map how they link it to colonialism and genocide; and analyse how they reflect on questions of guilt and responsibility, as well as culture’s own implication in the violence it depicts. Furthermore, we will explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to help people relate to the environmental crisis and promote critical self-reflection. EcoViolence will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research and ecocriticism by providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms. The project will result in a “best practices” guide to engage cultural representations in pedagogy to enhance critical literacies about ecoviolence and move beyond simplistic stories where everyone is either a victim or a perpetrator that have stifled full responses to our collective ecocidal trajectories.",
