        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal seeks to investigate the relationship between historical legacies and contemporary outcomes in conflict and economic development. Building on the new institutional economics, we aim to contribute to the ongoing debate on the interplay between institutions and human capital in shaping economic development and conflict. Utilizing a novel dataset of administrative records from the first colonizers of Latin America (1492-1599), we will conduct a within-country analysis to examine the relative importance of institutions versus human capital in explaining economic development and conflict in different regions of Latin America. The dataset, which includes information on settlers' personal characteristics and destinations, allows for a nuanced exploration of the interaction between human capital and institutions during the initial period of colonization. Furthermore, this research will also explore the persistence of institutions over time, drawing insights from the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization. In a complementary strand of the project, we will construct a dataset of ancient conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the long-term dynamics of conflict across regions and shed light on the sources of contemporary conflict. By adopting a dual historical approach, this research aims to provide a richer understanding of the enduring impact of historical legacies on economic development and conflict."

Following the lead of the new institutional economics, part of the literature argues that institutions cause differences in productivity and factor endowments which, in turn, explain economic development. An alternative view assumes that human capital shapes institutional changes and, therefore, institutions are endogenous. In the first part of the project, which is the core of the research proposal, I will try to move one step further in this debate by taking an approach that uses administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The data contain some personal characteristics on each of the settlers from 1492 to 1599 (town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, city of arrival in the Americas, etc). Using within-country analysis, since we have information on the precise destinations of the first “pobladores” (settlers), and the different institutional set-ups during the first years of colonization for different geographical areas in Latin America, I will reexamine the issue of institutions versus human capital in the explanation of economic development and conflict. The institutions in the initial times of colonization were not the same in all the regions of Latin America and, in many cases, represented an evolution of pre-Colombian institutions. The new data allows also the analysis of the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial times. In addition the migrations and the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization provide also some guidance for the research on the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part I plan to go further back in time to understand how very old conflicts influence current conflict. I will construct a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the dynamics of conflict by regions in the very long run.",
