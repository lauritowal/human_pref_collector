        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposed research project investigates the impact of household and firm heterogeneity on economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy. The study focuses on the development of a theoretical framework that differentiates between constrained and unconstrained agents, allowing for the identification of a heterogeneity wedge that explains the disparity between aggregate consumption and investment in economies with diverse households and firms, versus those with a representative agent. This framework will be applied to both theoretical Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models and empirical analysis using household and firm-level panel data. A comparative analysis of HANK and Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) models will also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of TANK models in approximating the dynamics of HANK models and their fit to empirical data. The project's findings will have significant implications for monetary policy, particularly in understanding the role of constrained households in influencing the effects of economic shocks and policy interventions, such as wage flexibility and helicopter drops. Ultimately, this research aims to shed light on the optimal monetary policy in the presence of household and firm heterogeneity."

A first objective is the development of an “organizing framework” which focuses on the distinction between two types of agents of households (or firms) at any point in time: those who satisfy an intertemporal optimality condition (labeled as “unconstrained”) and those who do not (labeled as “constrained”). A heterogeneity wedge can be defined that accounts for the differential behavior of aggregate consumption (or investment) relative to an economy with a representative household (or firm). The analysis of that wedge and its components should help understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates, both in the context of specific HANK models as well as actual economies (using household or firm-level panel data). A second objective is the conduct of a comparative analysis of the aggregate equilibrium dynamics of HANK and TANK (for Two Agent New Keynesian) models. The latter class of models, which preserve the tractability and ease of interpretation of the standard Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) model, restrict the heterogeneity to the presence of two types of agents (constrained and unconstrained), with a constant share of each in the population. The key question to be studied is the extent to which some version of a TANK model may provide a good approximation to the dynamics of existing HANK models, as well as a better data fit than their RANK counterparts. Several applications are proposed, including the analysis of the role of constrained households in shaping the gains from wage flexibility and in determining the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, as well as the study of the impact of heterogeneity on the nature of the optimal monetary policy.",
