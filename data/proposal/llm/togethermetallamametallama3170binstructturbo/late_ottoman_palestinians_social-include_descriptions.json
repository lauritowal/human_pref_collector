        "**Title: Unpacking Late Ottoman Palestine: Social Strategies and Dynamics in a Globalized World**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project delves into the complex social landscape of late Ottoman Palestine (1880-1920), a period marked by imperial expansion, globalization, and state-building. Amidst this transformative era, Palestinians employed diverse strategies to navigate challenges and secure social advancement. Through an in-depth examination of census-taking as a social process, this project seeks to understand the individual and collective practices that enabled Palestinians to cope with economic stress, social change, and imperial influence. By analyzing census data and developing a theoretical framework, this study aims to establish a comparative framework for social practices across the region and beyond, contributing to a global social and cultural history. The project also seeks to set new standards for Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire, enabling new perspectives on colonialism under the British Mandate and informing future research in the field."

Therefore, in this period we find the roots of many social formations that have remained relevant until the present. My focus is on the individual and collective practices for coping with various challenges and on census-taking as a social process. It will open up new perspectives on social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine, in a historical context defined by European imperialism, Ottoman state building and globalisation. The main research question is: which social strategies did late Ottoman Palestinians employ, across ethnic, religious and class divides, to confront challenges on the individual and collective levels? These include fostering social advancement of oneâ€™s household or coping with economic stress. My hypothesis is that an accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. Using the census process and its data I will establish yardsticks that will make it possible to compare social practices across the region and beyond, and thus contribute to ongoing efforts to write a global social and cultural history and it will develop a theoretical framework and methodological standards that will be useful for similar research projects. Specifically, the project aims to set new standards for how to realise the vision of an HGIS for the entire Ottoman Empire. Enabling comparison with other sources it may also offer intriguing new perspectives for the study of colonialism, notably under the British Mandate.",
