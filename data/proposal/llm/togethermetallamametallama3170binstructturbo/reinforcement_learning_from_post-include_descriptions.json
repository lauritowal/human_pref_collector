        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe neural mechanisms driving food selection and consumption remain poorly understood. Research in rodents has shown that post-ingestive sensory information influences food preferences, mediated by dopamine release and viscerosensory signals from the vagus nerve. Similar effects have been observed in humans, where pairing flavors with carbohydrates enhances pleasantness and consumption. However, the underlying mechanisms in humans are unclear, with recent findings suggesting that nutrient conditioning may modulate the value of actions rather than associated stimuli. This proposal, CalorieRL, aims to investigate post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior using a multidisciplinary approach combining computational reinforcement learning models, brain imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation. We hypothesize that food-seeking behavior is driven by a dopaminergic substrate, with neural activity in brain reward circuits influenced by sensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Furthermore, we will examine the relevance of post-ingestive reinforcement in the context of obesity, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of appetitive learning and their implications for understanding eating behavior."

Selection of food is guided by sensory feedback, including post-ingestive information about energy content, that has been studied across several species, paradigms and nutrients. In rodents, post-oral administration of sugar is associated with striatal dopamine release and conditions robust preferences, in part as a result of viscerosensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Consistently, in humans there is evidence that pairing a flavour with a tasteless carbohydrate will enhance pleasantness of the pre-ingestive stimulus and increase its consumption. However, available data in humans have provided limited mechanistic underpinnings for this process and, in our own experiments, performed with greater control of pre-ingestive stimulation, while we reproduced increased consumption of conditioned flavours, we found no evidence for post-ingestive mediated changes of pleasantness. Critically, this suggests that the impact of nutrient conditioning on behaviour and choice reflects the modulation of the value of actions, rather than that of associated stimuli. The application of computational reinforcement learning theory to human probabilistic decision-making tasks, which has allowed for renewed sophistication and progress to understand the mechanisms of appetitive learning, is yet to be applied to address this question. In CalorieRL, we will use computational reinforcement models applied to instrumental conditioning, in addition to brain functional and molecular imaging and peripheral nerve stimulation, to study post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behaviour. We hypothesize such behaviour has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits, resulting from sensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Importantly, we will also address if post-ingestive reinforcement is relevant in the context of obesity.",
