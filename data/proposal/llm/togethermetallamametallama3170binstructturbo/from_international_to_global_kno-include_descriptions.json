        "**Title:** Investigating the Shift from International Public Health to Global Health: A Socio-Historical Analysis\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project explores the transformation of health governance from the post-World War II era of international public health to the current regime of global health. Focusing on the intersection of globalization, knowledge production, and health practices, the study investigates the shift from eradication policies and nation-state-centric approaches to risk management, market-driven regulations, and public-private partnerships. Through a comparative analysis of four key health areas – tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics – the project examines how categories, treatment regimens, and health products have become integral to the global health landscape.\n\nBy combining historical and anthropological methods, the research examines the evolving role of international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, and highlights the experiences of non-Western countries, particularly India. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between global and local health practices, and the circulations of knowledge, goods, and policies across different contexts. The study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the transition from a Cold War-era political and economic order to a neoliberal, multi-centric world, and to shed light on the social, economic, and historical factors shaping the contemporary global health landscape."

The project seeks to understand this transition in terms of globalization processes, looking at the making of knowledge, the production and commercialization of health goods, the implementation of public health programs, and routine medical work. It will focus on four fields of investigations: tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine and medical genetics in order to understand how categories, standardized treatment regimens, industrial products, management tools or specific specialties have become elements in the global government of health. The project associates historical and anthropological investigations of practices in both international and local sites with strong interests in: a) the changing roles of WHO; b) the developments taking place in non-Western countries, India in the first place. The expected benefits of this research strategy are: a) to take into account social worlds including laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions and international organizations; b) to approach the global as something translated in and emerging from local practices and local knowledge; c) to explore different levels of circulations beyond the classical question of North-South transfers; d) to deepen our understanding of the transition from the political and economical order of the Cold War into a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty.",
