        "Title: Unlocking the Literary Heritage of Anglo-Saxon England: A Comprehensive Digital Corpus of Old English and Anglo-Latin Verse\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to create a groundbreaking online library of all surviving verse from Anglo-Saxon England, spanning over four centuries (c. 670-1100 CE). By consolidating and digitally encoding approximately 60,000 lines of poetry in Old English and Anglo-Latin, we aim to facilitate in-depth analysis of linguistic, stylistic, and thematic features across the corpus. This bilingual database will enable researchers to identify patterns of influence and connection between texts, poets, and languages, shedding new light on the evolution of Anglo-Saxon literature and its place within the broader European context. Through a combination of digital tools, conferences, and publications, our project will make this rich literary heritage accessible to a modern audience, fostering innovative perspectives on the cultural and literary landscape of medieval England and beyond. By providing a comprehensive, interactive, and multilingual corpus, we will revolutionize the field of Anglo-Saxon studies, enabling scholars to explore, analyze, and interpret the oldest surviving poetry in England in unprecedented ways."

CLASP will focus on all surviving verse of Anglo-Saxon England, composed in Old English and Anglo-Latin over a period of over four centuries (c. 670â€“1100 CE), and produce for the first time an online and interactive consolidated library, marked up through TEI P5 XML to facilitate the identification of idiosyncratic features of sound, metre, spellings, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres across the entire corpus, so forging connections and suggesting more certain chains of influence both within and between the two main literary languages of Anglo-Saxon England. The bilingual corpus comprises almost 60,000 lines of poetry, with about half surviving in each language, and mostly appearing in only a single witness, usually in manuscript. More than fifty named poets are identified, many of them dateable with more or less precision, whose influence on each other can be closely documented, while in the case of anonymous verse, most of which is in Old English, the focus will be on tracing potential influence between texts, to establish a comparative rather than an absolute chronology. CLASP will use the full panoply of digital resources, including sound- and image-files where relevant, to make the oldest surviving poetry in England available to a modern audience for unprecedented kinds of exploration, comprehensive analysis, and interrogation, and in a series of conferences, workshops, and other publications will show the potential of such a comprehensive multilingual corpus to revolutionize perspectives not only on Anglo-Saxon England, but elsewhere in Europe, where Latin and the vernacular likewise co-existed in a Christian context across centuries.",
