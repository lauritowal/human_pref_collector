        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project aims to redefine the narrative of European welfare and social care by highlighting the pivotal role of local actors, such as families and associations, in shaping welfare systems in three distinct European border regions: the Galician, North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German borderlands. By examining the complex interactions among local actors from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this research will shed light on the collaborative and often contested nature of welfare provision in these regions, where state influence was frequently limited and diverse local structures based on various forms of identity and solidarity emerged. \n\nThrough in-depth local studies and comparative analysis, this project will investigate the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that have long characterized European welfare systems, particularly in contexts where competing structures of social provision coexisted. By placing these local studies within a broader transnational framework, we will explore the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across north-western, eastern, and south-eastern Europe. This research seeks to contribute to ongoing debates about welfare reform, providing a nuanced historical understanding of the development of European welfare systems and their relevance to contemporary societal challenges."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",
