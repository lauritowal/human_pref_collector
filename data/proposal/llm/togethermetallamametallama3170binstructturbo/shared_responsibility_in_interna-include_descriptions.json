        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, Rethinking Shared Responsibility in International Cooperation (R-SRIC), aims to reexamine the allocation of international responsibilities in collaborative efforts to achieve common objectives, such as protecting the environment and preventing human rights atrocities. As multiple actors work together, their individual responsibilities become increasingly complex and diminished, potentially undermining the effectiveness of international responsibility schemes. The existing framework, based on individual responsibility, lacks the necessary concepts and perspectives to address shared responsibilities effectively.\n\nR-SRIC will investigate the extent and nature of this problem, developing new approaches to match international cooperation with a corresponding system of responsibility. The project will explore two key aspects: principles of international responsibility, including collective, joint, and proportional responsibility, and processes, focusing on how quasi-judicial mechanisms can better account for the collective context of international policies. Through a combination of conceptual analysis, theoretical foundation, and empirical case-studies, R-SRIC seeks to improve our understanding of the principles and processes required to establish a robust system of shared responsibility in the face of growing international cooperation."

International cooperation may complicate attempts to determine who is responsible for what. SHARES is based on the unrecognized and unexplored fact that as the responsibility for policies is shared among more actors, the discrete responsibility of every individual actor is diminished proportionately. International cooperation paradoxically may undermine the key objectives of any scheme of responsibility : the protection of the international rule of law and the provision of remedies of injured parties. The dominant principle of individual responsibility, and the scholarship based on it, provides us neither with the concepts nor the perspectives for addressing shared responsibilities. SHARES will uncover the extent and nature of the problem of scattering of international responsibilities in cases of international cooperation and will provide fresh perspectives on how cooperation can be better matched by a corresponding system of international responsibility. It will pursue two interlocking tracks, focussing on principles and processes of international responsibility. As to principles, it will examine the possibility of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly or proportionately responsible. As to processes, SHARES will rethink how (quasi-)judicial processes may better taken into account the collective context of the international policies of states and other actors. SHARES will complement a conceptual and theoretical foundation with a thorough empirical approach, exploring through case-studies how we can improve our understanding of the principles and processes that are needed to match the unprecedented international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility.",
