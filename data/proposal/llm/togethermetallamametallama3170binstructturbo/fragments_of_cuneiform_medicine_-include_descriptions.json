        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project, BabMed, undertakes a groundbreaking investigation of ancient Babylonian medical science, exploring the largest collection of pre-Hippocratic medical data. By integrating cuneiform materials with Aramaic texts from the Babylonian Talmud, we challenge traditional narratives that have overlooked Babylonian medicine due to inaccessible cuneiform literature. Our research tests two key hypotheses: the longevity of cuneiform usage and the derivation of Aramaic medicine from Akkadian sources. Employing native taxonomies, we will reassess the history of medicine, moving beyond flawed retrospective diagnoses that have dominated the field. By comparing Babylonian medicine to neighboring systems, we aim to counter the prevailing Eurocentrism that has positioned Greek medicine as the standard for ancient medicine. Our findings will establish a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer in ancient medicine, revealing how script and language barriers were overcome and how Babylonian medicine was preserved in the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text bridging Greco-Roman and Persian scientific traditions."

The latest phase of Babylonian medicine, as preserved in Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud, has never been systematically studied in the light of older cuneiform materials. The absence of accessible cuneiform medical literature has forced recent medical histories to bypass Babylonian medicine, while Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has simply been ignored. BabMed tests a number of 'high risk' propositions, including two key hypotheses: 1) cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected, and 2) Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. BabMed's methodology relies upon native taxonomies rather than modern biomedical disease classifications, countering flawed retrospective diagnoses that obviate the entire history of medicine. Comparisons with neighbouring medical systems challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories, in which Greek medicine has become the standard for all ancient medicine. BabMed will introduce a new paradigm for knowledge transfer which will recognise the barriers between ancient arts of medicine and how they were overcome in antiquity. One such barrier was script and language, and BabMed proposes that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text which straddles the borders of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia and mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds.",
