        "**Abstract:**\n\nApproximately two billion people worldwide face nutrient deficiencies due to limited dietary options. Current food security policies in low-income countries prioritize increasing agricultural production and caloric intake. However, this approach often overlooks the crucial role of forests in providing diverse food sources and nutritional benefits to rural communities. This project aims to investigate the impact of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality in low-income countries.\n\nA multi-scale, data-driven approach will be employed to identify hotspots of forest change and deteriorating diets, and to develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages. By linking publicly available household data on food consumption with forest metrics, this study will provide the first empirical evidence of the relationship between forests and dietary quality. In-depth fieldwork in two countries will further elucidate the causal relationships between forest loss and local dietary outcomes.\n\nThe findings of this project will challenge conventional food security policies by highlighting the importance of socio-ecological interactions between forests and agriculture. By recognizing the role of forests in dietary diversification, this research will inform a more holistic approach to food security, one that considers the interdependencies between forest ecosystems and human nutrition."

Dietary diversification is key to solving this problem, yet food security policy, especially in low-income countries, still focuses on increasing agricultural production and access to sufficient calories as the main solution. But calories are not all equal. Indeed, this approach has created a blind spot with respect to the role of forests, which are often overlooked but may be important for dietary diversification for the rural poor by providing wild foods, high-value products which can be sold and thereby enable food purchases, and fodder for livestock which then provide meat, milk and eggs as well as manure to improve agricultural production. This project will identify how forest loss and fragmentation affect people’s dietary quality. I will apply a cutting-edge multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach. First, I will take a broad-scale perspective to explore where forest loss, forest fragmentation, and dietary changes are taking place and identify hotspots of forest change and deteriorating diets. To do so, I will spatially link publicly available household data on food consumption, with metrics on the proportion and spatial arrangement of forest from longitudinal datasets. Second, I will unravel the mechanisms linking forests and diets to develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages. Third, I will zoom in on selected sites in two countries and use in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes locally. The project will break new ground by providing the first generalizable empirical evidence of how and why forests influence dietary quality in low-income countries, thereby laying the ground for a shift in how we think about pathways to food security – that is, to move from conceptualizing food security as driven by agriculture alone to seeing it as dependent on socio-ecological interactions at the forest-agriculture nexus.",
