    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of OsciLang, a novel, wearable brain-computer interface neurofeedback system designed to diagnose and treat language disorders, including dyslexia and specific language impairment. Building on recent research highlighting impaired auditory processing in dyslexia, OsciLang leverages neural oscillations to enhance brain-speech synchronization, a crucial aspect of language function. The system utilizes EEG to measure and provide real-time feedback on neural activity, enabling users to exert top-down control over specific activation patterns. By focusing on phase coherence at theta and delta bands, OsciLang offers an innovative approach to neurofeedback training, with the potential to improve literacy skills in individuals with language impairments. Furthermore, this project lays the groundwork for a broader framework and technology to enhance reading abilities in the general population. With its affordable, lightweight, and user-friendly design, OsciLang has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, providing a valuable tool for individuals, educators, and clinicians."

To date there is no established neurofeedback protocols for treating language or reading impairments. In essence, this tool will (a) diagnose/measure and (b) improve/rehabilitate an individual’s ability to synchronize their brain’s activity with changes in a speech signal. This novel type of neurofeedback, based on phase coherence of the neural oscillatory activity with speech, will allow us to detect and enhance language function. It capitalizes on our recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, where we found reduced auditory tracking in delta band in dyslexic readers compared with controls, advocating impaired auditory processing in dyslexia. Thus, our work and related findings suggest that literacy skills in dyslexics will improve by means of neurofeedback training protocols that enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, especially in noisy environments. OsciLang will help to sustainably enhance brain-speech synchronization strength by allowing participants to shape their neural activity while tracking speech. This will be accomplished by presenting participants with a simple and friendly interface that quantifies basic parameters of their brain activity in real time, measured via EEG. This information can then be used by participants to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Based on our prior findings, OsciLang’ algorithms will be monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, an innovative approach that has yet to be implemented in a neurofeedback system. Oscilang will also lay the foundations for extending this novel approach to provide a general framework and technology for enhancing any individual’s ability to learn to read.",
