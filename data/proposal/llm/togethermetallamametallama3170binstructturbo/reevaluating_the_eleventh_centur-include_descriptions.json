        "**Title:** Recontextualizing Medieval History through Digital Assertion-Making: A Trans-Regional Approach to the Late 11th Century\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the way digital historical data is created, curated, and analyzed by reframing existing and new information as assertions linked to authoritative sources. By acknowledging the inherent complexity and disputed nature of historical facts, our approach enables nuanced manipulation and interlinking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, and conflict. We will apply this innovative methodology to a critical yet underexamined aspect of medieval history, focusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095) in the eastern half of Christendom and its interconnected regions. By harnessing a broad range of digital resources from sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, we aim to contextualize and reuse existing online data, preventing its loss and promoting a deeper understanding of trans-regional trends and communication networks. Our trans-regional approach will facilitate a multifaceted examination of this pivotal period, moving beyond dominant narratives and shedding new light on the complex history of the late 11th century."

The approach is to re-frame both existing and new historical data as assertions, often sourced but always linked to an authority; this allows data to be manipulated according to source and authority, and also allows assertions themselves to be linked depending on whether they corroborate, depend on, or conflict with each other. The novel aspect of this methodology is that it takes to its logical conclusion something that historians all readily acknowledge and that is especially apparent for pre-modern history: that there are very few, if any, simple and undisputed facts. A related challenge is the contextualisation and reuse of existing online data for the period, to avoid its going to waste. The approach is tested by taking a broad trans-regional approach to the history of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), centred broadly in the eastern half of Christendom but incorporating developments elsewhere, especially in the newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The looming weight of the First Crusade at the century's end means that while certain regional or proto-national narratives—particularly for western Europe—are well-developed, they tend to obscure the larger trans-regional trends of communication and contact, particularly in eastern Christendom. By drawing upon the depth of scholarship and the plethora of digital resources that have emerged for this period in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, and by framing this scholarship in terms of assertions whose authority is traceable, it will become possible to look at the history not just from \"the eastern perspective\", but from several.",
