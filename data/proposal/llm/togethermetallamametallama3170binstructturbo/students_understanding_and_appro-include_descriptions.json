        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn pursuit of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, Global Citizenship Education (GCE) aims to empower learners to build inclusive and secure societies. Despite its potential, the effective implementation of GCE hinges on a deeper understanding of how students perceive, engage with, and internalize its principles. This project proposes a pioneering study to examine students' agency in GCE, moving beyond the assumption that they are passive recipients of knowledge. By adopting a student-centered approach, this research will investigate how students from diverse backgrounds in six countries (Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK) understand, interpret, and apply GCE in their daily lives.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining group discussions, photovoice activism, social media analysis, and policy analysis, this study will address four key questions: (1) What are the varying understandings of GCE among students from different backgrounds? (2) How do students appropriate GCE in their lives? (3) How do understandings of GCE differ within and across countries, curricula, contexts, and education systems? (4) To what extent do student attitudes align with the expectations of international organizations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, and teachers? The findings of this study will provide a critical baseline for the effective implementation of GCE, informing policymakers, educators, and stakeholders on how to tailor GCE to meet the needs of the next generation."

It is claimed to have the potential to transform education systems, empowering learners to build more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies, while fostering mutual understanding, especially in interactions between indigenous and migrant populations. Many education systems now expect students to appropriate GCE in their day-to-day. Extant research has addressed challenges in developing GCE, examining capacity building (teachers’ readiness to teach GCE) or mapping inconsistencies in theoretical approaches. However, with no systematic baseline research to show how GCE is understood and appropriated by students, there is little hope of real progress by 2030. STUDACT starts afresh, hypothesising that students are not mere passive recipients of learning – they differ in their desire to engage with GCE, based on personal traits or context. It will explore and contextualise how students receive, understand and appropriate GCE, treating them as core partners and agentic participants. Data will be collected in Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK – all countries with a high migrant influx. Four work packages give students a voice to develop meaningful GCE, using group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. Policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance will be analysed. STUDACT will answer four questions to ensure a strong foundation for GCE to deliver on its promise of educating the next generation: (1) how do students of different backgrounds understand GCE? (2) how do students appropriate GCE? (3) how do understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems? (4) how are student attitudes aligned with those inferred by international organisations, teacher training programmes, curricula developers, or teachers?",
