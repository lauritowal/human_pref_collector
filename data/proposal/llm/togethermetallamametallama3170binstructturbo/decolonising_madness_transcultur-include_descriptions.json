        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical development of transcultural psychiatry and the concept of a 'global psyche'. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we will investigate the colonial and post-colonial roots of the current global mental health movement, shedding light on the pivotal period following World War II and decolonisation. Our research will examine the emergence of Western psychiatry's attempts to leave behind its colonial legacies and establish a more inclusive dialogue with non-Western mental health communities. By exploring the search for universal psychological mechanisms across cultures, we aim to understand the historical forces that drove this movement and the negotiations between cultural particularities and cross-cultural models of the mind.\n\nOur investigation will address key questions about this transformative period, including how psychiatrists redefined the relationship between culture, race, and individual psyche, and the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in shaping this new global psychiatry. By examining the successes and limitations of this movement, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding mental health and illness across cultures and inform future approaches to global mental health initiatives. This project will offer a unique historical analysis of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences, providing crucial insights into the ongoing debates about the universality of mental health concepts."

It will offer the first historical analysis of the colonial and post-colonial roots of the current global mental health movement, and the first systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. It will argue that the concept of universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of WWII and during decolonisation, when Western psychiatry strove to leave behind its colonial legacies, and lay the foundation for a more inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities. In this period, leading psychiatrists across the globe set about identifying and defining the universal psychological mechanisms supposedly shared among all cultures (and 'civilisations'). I will explore this far-reaching psychiatric, social and cultural search for a new definition of 'common humanity', which developed in an increasingly inter-connected and culturally diverse global context, and examine the historical forces that drove it. I will also examine how the profession negotiated the tensions between researching cultural particularities and developing new, cross-cultural models of the mind. The project will answer some of the core questions related to this transformative period: How did psychiatrists and anthropologists from all over the world re-define the relationship between culture, race and individual psyche following the end of the Second World War and colonialism, what was the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in this transformative process, and did this new global and transcultural psychiatry succeed in departing from the erstwhile colonial frameworks?",
