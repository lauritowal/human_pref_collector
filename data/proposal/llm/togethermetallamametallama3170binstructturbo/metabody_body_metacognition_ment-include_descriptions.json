        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nAdvances in technology and societal pressures have created a complex landscape where individuals can curate and manipulate their bodily appearance. This raises fundamental questions about the interplay between the stability and malleability of our identity. To address this issue, our research proposes a paradigm shift in understanding body image by introducing the concept of \"Dynamic Body Representation.\" This framework posits that body image is not a static construct, but rather a dynamic process of inference influenced by prior expectations and new information. \n\nOur study aims to investigate the metacognitive aspects of body image inferences, exploring how individuals weigh their internal experiences against external, social, and future-oriented perspectives. Three interconnected research packages will examine: (1) how individuals integrate internal and external perceptions of their body, (2) the impact of social interactions on body perception, and (3) decision-making processes related to body modification. By examining these dynamics, our research seeks to shed new light on the intricate balance between identity stability and transformation in a world where body modification has become increasingly accessible."

These proliferating phenomena raise the age-old question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity. Addressing this question in relation to modern body image phenomena requires a radical new way of studying the concept of body image. METABODY proposes the novel concept of Body Imagining to capture the idea that our body image is not a fixed representation in the brain, but rather a dynamic inference based on prior expectations and new information. Studying the balance between prior beliefs and new information could thus hold the key to understanding modern body image phenomena. Moreover, existing studies have failed to investigate the metacognitive level of these inferences. METABODY will test the novel hypothesis that body image disturbances are not the result of biases merely in the 1st order ability to perceive oneâ€™s body, but also in the 2nd order ability to evaluate the reliability of these perceptions in given contexts. Specifically, three empirical work-packages will study how individuals balance their own embodied experience against: (1) external perspectives on the body during multisensory perception (Body Metacognition), (2) social perspectives during interpersonal encounters (Body Mentalizing) and (3) future and ideal body perspectives during decisions about body modification options with uncertain outcome (Body Decision Making). Ultimately, METABODY will address in innovative ways the timely question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity in a time when changing the body is offered as an easy way to change the self.",
