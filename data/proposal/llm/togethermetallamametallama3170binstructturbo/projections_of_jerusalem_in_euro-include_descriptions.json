        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis multidisciplinary project aims to document, analyze, and conceptualize the numerous European re-creations of Jerusalem, which are monumental, interactive, and multimedia in nature. These sites replicate the loca sancta through intricate architectures, sculptural groups, and artifacts, creating immersive experiences for devotees. Despite their significance, these sites have never been comprehensively studied, and their exact number remains unknown.\n\nThrough a comprehensive survey and comparative analysis, this project will not only uncover new data but also generate novel insights into the phenomenon of these re-creations. By employing concepts such as iconography, mapping, and spatial analysis, the research will integrate these three-dimensional complexes into ongoing discourses on image, pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, and memory.\n\nThe project's methodology will involve field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and grouping of related monuments, leading to the identification of representative clusters at a Pan-European and historical level. Regular discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences with external experts will facilitate the conclusion-reaching process.\n\nThe project's outcomes will be disseminated through publications at various stages, culminating in a comprehensive book at the end of the research period. By exploring these previously understudied sites, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex relationships between original and copy, narrative and iconic representation, and the formation of sacred spaces."

These monuments represent the loca sancta through architectures in spatial and topographical relationships that reproduce the real ones, sculptural groups that re-enact the respective event in a painted d√©cor, with artifacts completing the ambience. The project proposes to document, comprehensively study and conceptualize these sites. Their exact number is not known since a comprehensive study has never yet been attempted, but they can probably be numbered in many hundreds. This project will open up a totally new research area with considerable impact already at the initial documentation and survey stages, by bringing together both fresh data and interpretations. But the project proposes to go beyond and generate many new insights by a comparative study of the sites and a conceptualization of the phenomenon (with the aid of notions such as icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, space and place). The study will lead to the integration of these three-dimensional complexes in the ongoing discourse of image, and to the theoretical discourse pertaining to the relationships between original and copy, narrative and iconic. It will contribute essential new insights to the study of pilgrimage, the definition and process of the formation of sacred spaces, to devotionalism as a special type of piety and to the study of memory and mnemonic practices. Research will include field and textual documentation, cross referencing and grouping of related monuments, leading to crystallization of several clusters of monuments, representative at Pan-European and historical levels. Research will be accompanied by a conclusion-reaching process through discussions in small groups, exchange of working papers, as well as symposia and conferences with external participation. The results will be published throughout the stages of work, as well as in a book at the end of the research period.",
