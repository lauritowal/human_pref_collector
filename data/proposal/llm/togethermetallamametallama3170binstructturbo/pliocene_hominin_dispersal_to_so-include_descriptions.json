        "**Project Title: Unveiling the Origins of Human Adaptability**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project aims to investigate the evolution of human adaptability and the dispersal of early hominins to temperate and seasonal habitats. Focusing on the Plio-Pleistocene hominins found in higher latitudes of South Africa, our study seeks to determine whether human behavioural and physiological flexibility evolved early in our evolutionary history or was facilitated by palaeoclimatic conditions and stochastic events. \n\nWe will reconstruct the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, develop dynamic models of past precipitation and vegetation patterns, and conduct detailed analyses of the hominin fossil record. By integrating these datasets, we will evaluate species diversity, geneflow, and dispersal scenarios to shed light on the origins of human adaptability.\n\nOur study is guided by three working hypotheses: (1) East African hominin ranges expanded and contracted in response to wet and dry phases, leading to the isolation of southern populations; (2) the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and changes in the Kalahari basin drainage pattern resulted in intermittent gene flow between East African and South African hominins; and (3) tectonic and hydrographic changes led to the emergence of the Zambezi River as a barrier, resulting in the endemism of South African hominins younger than 1.5 million years ago. By exploring these hypotheses, our project will provide new insights into the evolution of human adaptability and the dispersal of early hominins."

This trait facilitated their dispersal out-of-Africa to higher latitudes, i.e. to temperate and seasonal habitats, during the Pleistocene. However, there are Plio-Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa (SA) from ~3.7Ma onwards. Did human behavioural/physiological flexibility evolve early in our evolutionary history? Alternatively, did Pliocene hominins occupy such temperate zones due to different palaeoclimatic conditions in deep time and/or due to stochastic events? To untangle these questions this project will: (1) determine the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, (2) create dynamic palaeo-precipitation/-vegetation models from various archives, (3) carry out detailed anatomical, functional and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record and (4) combine the datasets to appraise species diversity (functional adaptations), geneflow (hybridization) and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography). 3 key working hypotheses underlie the proposal: 1. >2.6Ma East African (EA) hominin ranges expanded/contracted in accord with wet and dry phases; periodically, the southernmost populations became reproductively isolated. Early SA hominins represent descendants of Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, respectively. 2. ~2.6-1.5Ma With the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the re-organisation of the drainage pattern within the Kalahari basin, dispersal corridors repeatedly closed (vicariance) and opened, resulting in intermittent levels of gene flow (i.e. hybridization) between EA and SA hominins. 3. <~1.5Ma Tectonic and hydrographic changes led to the Zambezi River becoming a powerful barrier during the Pleistocene. SA hominins younger than 1.5Ma are likely the result of endemism; competitive exclusion amongst these hominins resulted in exploitation of distinct ecological niche",
