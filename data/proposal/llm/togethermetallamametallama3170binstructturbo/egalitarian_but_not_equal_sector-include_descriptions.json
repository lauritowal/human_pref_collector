        "Title: Investigating the Intersection of Collective Bargaining and the Gender Pay Gap: A Comparative Analysis\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe persistent global disparity in wages between men and women, with women earning an average of 20% less than their male counterparts, remains a pressing issue. Despite efforts to eliminate the gender pay gap (GPG) through collective bargaining, the disparity persists even in countries committed to addressing the issue. This project seeks to understand the relationship between collective bargaining and the GPG by examining the experiences of Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The study will employ ethnographic research methods to investigate the metal and nursing sectors, analyzing the historical context, daily practices, and actor dynamics that influence wage formation and sectoral gendered wage differentials. The research objectives include: (1) comparing and synthesizing the histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries, (2) examining collective bargaining practices in the metal and nursing sectors, and (3) analyzing how actors relate to wage norms and sectoral gendered wage differentials. By exploring the intersection of collective bargaining and the GPG from an inter-sectoral perspective, this study will contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for achieving gender equity in the workplace."

In countries explicitly committed to eliminating the gender pay gap (GPG), such as those in Europe, women still earn, on average, 13% less than men do (Eurostat, 2022). This is regardless of the fact that countries with persistent GPGs have deployed a strategic institutional measure to raise the wage floor of feminised work sectors and reduce the GPG – namely, collective bargaining. The overall aim of WAGE is to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining by investigating the past, the unruly present and the possible future of regulated collective bargaining processes in three key countries: Germany, Norway and Sweden. Moreover, the project’s research design will involve gathering data at the sectoral level of the metal sector and nursing and will use ethnographic research methods. To realise its overall aim, WAGE will accomplish the following three research objectives: 1. Compare and synthesise existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. 2. Uncover and analyse daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male dominated metal sector and the female dominated nursing sector. 3. Document and explain how actors embedded in the male dominated metal and the female dominated nursing sector relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. Given the dearth of scholarship on the relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes from an inter-sectoral angle, this study will be the first to systematically use qualitative methods to explore the economic frontier between sectoral gendered wage differentials and collective wage formation, thereby contributing to the effort to achieve gender equity in practice.",
