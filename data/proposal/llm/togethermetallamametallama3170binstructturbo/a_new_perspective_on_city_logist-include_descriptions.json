        "**Title:** Revolutionizing City Logistics through Public Value-Centric Network Optimization\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe convergence of social, economic, and technological trends is transforming the movement of people, products, and services, necessitating a paradigm shift in city logistics (CL). The current CL framework, focused on private interests, fails to address the emerging challenges and opportunities. This proposal, \"Revolutionizing City Logistics,\" aims to develop a novel, network-centric approach prioritizing public value. The project will achieve three objectives: (1) create a public value measurement system to guide CL planning and management, leveraging multi-criteria decision-making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization; (2) design the infrastructure for Logistics as a Service (LaaS), employing novel network optimization methods to maximize efficiency and public value; and (3) establish a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization methods to ensure efficiency, reliability, and public value. By redefining CL through a public value-centric lens, this project will lay the groundwork for a new theoretical framework with significant scientific, practical, and societal implications, transforming the transport and logistics landscape."

Goods are gaining more mobility with drastic implications for cities. The current city logistics (CL) paradigm, which does not consider the mobility of goods a public need, limits our capacity to understand and respond to the challenges and opportunities brought by this profound change. Taking a different perspective, GoodMobility proposes to replace the techno-business-centric smart thinking with network-centric wise logistics that takes the public value as the primary goal and envisions setting up a logistics web with the required infrastructure (hardware) and operating procedures (software) to establish logistics as a service (LaaS). The first objective is to develop public value as a measurement system to assess and guide CL planning and management, which will be achieved with an iterative process, combining multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. The second objective is to develop the principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design. Novel network optimization methods will be developed for designing the hardware of LaaS to provide orders of magnitude efficiency gains and influence the stakeholder activities to maximize public value. The third objective is to develop a theoretical framework and models for the operating procedures of LaaS, introducing the logistics markets to ensure efficiency and reliability and secure public value in matching logistics demand and supply. Learning-based optimization methods will be developed to manage logistics markets. If successful, GoodMobility will lay the foundations of a new theory of CL with significant scientific and practical implications. The novel ideas, concepts, and methodologies will open up new research perspectives in transport and logistics with far-reaching social, economic, and environmental consequences.",
