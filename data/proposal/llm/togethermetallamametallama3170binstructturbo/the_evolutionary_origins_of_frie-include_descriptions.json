        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nFriendship is a vital component of human health and well-being, with its absence posing significant risks to cardiovascular health and overall quality of life. To better understand the complexities of social relationships, it is essential to examine the evolutionary origins of friendship. This project seeks to uncover the underlying causes and consequences of friendly social bonds by studying nonhuman primates, specifically macaques. Through a comprehensive cross-species dataset and innovative social experiments, we aim to address three key questions: (1) What environmental factors drive variation in social bonds across species? (2) Is the ability to understand and track the friendships of unrelated others a unique human skill? And (3) Does social isolation result from competitive exclusion? By exploring these questions, this project will provide critical insights into the evolution of friendship and shed light on its significance in human societies. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of human nature and inform strategies for promoting social connection and mitigating the negative effects of social isolation."

People who are socially isolated have a greater risk of heart disease than heavy smokers, drinkers, and the obese, and halting social isolation’s ongoing rise is a growing priority for public health and political policy. But coming to grips with our need for friends and the consequences we face in their absence requires we not only look at how friendship is manifested in contemporary societies but to its origins in our evolutionary past. Yet, the evolutionary origins of friendship and the degree to which friendship’s components reflect human specializations are unclear. Studying nonhuman primates allows us to identify the causes and consequences of friendship in evolutionary time and the extent of its human uniqueness. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly little about the contexts that drove friendly social bonds to emerge, whether friendship-relevant cognitive abilities reflect primate universals, and the reasons why evolution allows social isolation to persist despite being detrimental. In this project, I will conduct a series of landmark studies to reveal critical insights into the evolutionary origins of friendship. I will generate an unparalleled cross-species dataset on the best-known taxa of group-living primates, the macaques, and will perform innovative social experiments on a unique macaque population. I have three key aims: (1) to test the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species; (2) to establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill; and (3) to test whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion. Friendship may be one of the most important strategies humans have for surviving in large groups. Understanding friendship from an evolutionary perspective is therefore a critical component of understanding what it means to be human. The proposed project represents a major step forward in that endeavour.",
