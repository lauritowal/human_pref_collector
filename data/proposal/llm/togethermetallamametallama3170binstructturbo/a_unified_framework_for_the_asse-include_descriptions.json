        "**Abstract:**\n\nCognitive models provide a powerful framework for understanding human behavior, reasoning, and decision-making processes. Despite their growing popularity in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, the field of cognitive modeling lacks systematicity, hindering the development, application, and interpretation of these models. This proposal outlines a comprehensive program aimed at unifying the assessment and application of cognitive models. Leveraging Bayesian inference, our research team will develop novel methods for evaluating model fit, estimating parameters, and applying models to various experimental designs. We will focus on three influential classes of cognitive models, including decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models, and enhance their utility through the development of parameter priors, diagnostic experiments, and model-averaged assessments. By integrating these techniques into the user-friendly JASP statistical software, we will make cognitive models and new methodologies accessible to a broad audience of researchers, students, and practitioners. The proposed research aims to establish a new standard for cognitive modeling, promoting a more systematic and practical approach to understanding human cognition."

Cognitive models also serve as measurement tools that explain observed behavior in terms of constituent psychological processes. Because of their unique ability to estimate latent processes, cognitive models are increasingly applied throughout cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. Despite their theoretical appeal and growing popularity, however, the field of cognitive modeling presents an often bewildering proliferation of ideas and techniques. Current applications appear idiosyncratic, and the state-of-the-art remains unclear. This lack of systematicity makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to develop, understand, and apply important cognitive models. This proposal outlines a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models. Based on the foundations of Bayesian inference, a Quantitative Development Team develops new generic methods to assess absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, explores efficient algorithms to estimate model parameters, and examines how the models can be applied to data from popular experimental designs. A Core Application Team focuses on three classes of cognitive models of particular impact: the drift decision models, the stop-signal race models, and the reinforcement learning models. These model classes are enriched by the construction of plausible parameter priors, the development of diagnostic experiments, the assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs, and the model-averaged assessment of changes in parameters. The proposed work aims to set a new standard for cognitive modeling. Practical relevance is enhanced by incorporating the techniques in JASP, a user-friendly statistical software package developed in my lab (jasp-stats.org). By adding the new techniques to JASP, the cognitive models and associated new methodology become available for students, researchers, and practitioners.",
