        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes the development of a novel framework for understanding the complex dynamics of cultural encounter and religious exchange in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. This vast region, spanning from the Taklamakan desert to Northeast China, served as a crossroads for ancient civilizations, with the Silk Road facilitating the transfer of Buddhism and adjacent cultural aspects. The proposed research will investigate the localization of Buddhism in Eastern Central Asia between the 6th-14th centuries, examining how the adoption of Buddhism shaped diverse cultures and civilizations, transcending ethnic and linguistic boundaries.\n\nBy integrating insights from Philology, Art History, Archaeology, and Religious Studies, this project will reconstruct a trans-regional and trans-cultural network of Buddhist exchange, highlighting the relationships between Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, and local Buddhist traditions, such as Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan. This research will contribute to a broader Comparative Religious Studies agenda, providing a unique perspective on the dynamic network of religious exchange in Eastern Central Asia. The proposed framework will offer a systematic analysis of the complex interactions between trans-regional and local Buddhist traditions, shedding new light on the history of Eastern Central Asia and its significance in the broader context of Asian cultural heritage."

This region was the crossroads of ancient civilisations. Its uniqueness was determined by complex dynamics of religious and cultural exchanges gravitating around an ancient communication artery, known as the Silk Road. Buddhism was one major factor in this exchange; its transfer predetermined the transfer of adjacent aspects of culture. The religious exchange involved a variety of cultures and civilisations, which were modified and shaped by their adoption of Buddhism. This process overrode the ethnic and linguistic boundaries of the Buddhist universe. One specific aspect of this process was the rise of the local forms of Buddhism. This project intends to investigate such Buddhist localisations between the 6th–14th centuries. I will create a new trans-regional and trans-cultural vision of the religious transfer in Eastern Central Asian history and will reconstruct this Buddhist network with its entities and relations. It will incorporate the fascinating, but as yet under-researched field of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into a broader research agenda of Comparative Religious Studies. It will establish a new research approach by bringing together many research fields and agendas (such as Philology, Art History, Archaeology, Religious Studies) into one synthesising narrative based on a unique perspective, in which, religious exchange in Eastern Central Asia will be analysed as a dynamic network emerging in its spatial and temporal aspects. For the first time the multi-layered relationships between the trans-regional Buddhist traditions (Chinese, Indian, Tibetan) and those based on local Buddhist cultures (Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, Kitan) will be explored in a systematic way.",
