        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project, COMMIOS, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of Iron Age Britain and Europe through a pioneering integration of cutting-edge methods in ancient DNA analysis, isotope research, osteoarchaeology, and cultural archaeology. By analyzing the genomes of approximately 1,250 Iron Age individuals from the UK and Europe, alongside isotopic analysis, we aim to reconstruct the genetic, social, and cultural landscape of this pivotal period (800 BC – AD 100). Our research will explore the dynamics of population movement, inter-regional connectivity, and the emergence of social inequalities within Iron Age societies.\n\nThe project will also delve into the intricacies of household and kin-group composition, familial relationships, and gender-specific mobility patterns. By harnessing the power of innovative scientific methods, we will bridge the gap between cultural anthropology and archaeology, enabling a more nuanced understanding of prehistoric societies. This ambitious initiative, led by a team of world-renowned experts, will set a new standard for future archaeological research in Europe and beyond, providing a transformative vision of Iron Age communities and their place within the broader European context."

COMMIOS integrates these cutting-edge methods on a scale not previously attempted, within a ground-breaking interdisciplinary framework, to provide a radically new vision of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) within their wider European context. At the broad scale, we will conduct the first concerted programme of genome-wide ancient DNA analysis on Iron Age populations anywhere in the world (c. 1000 individuals in the UK, 250 in Europe), mapping genetic clusters to shed light on ancient populations themselves and on their relationships to modern genetic patterning. Together with isotope analysis, and underpinned by both osteoarchaeological and cultural archaeological approaches, this will also enable us to directly address critical issues of population movement and inter-regional connectivity in Iron Age Europe. We will utilise the power of these new scientific methods to examine the structure and social dynamics of Iron Age societies in Britain, including household and kin-group composition, the identification of familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. Previously the preserve of cultural anthropologists studying recent societies, we will draw these questions into the archaeological domain, opening up new areas of enquiry for prehistoric societies. The scope and scale of the project represents a new departure for European archaeology, made possible by the coming-of-age of new analytical methods. Many of these have been pioneered by the project team, which comprises world-leaders in the fields of ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling and cultural archaeology. Although focussed on Iron Age Britain, the project will establish a new benchmark for future analyses of other regions and periods in Europe and beyond.",
