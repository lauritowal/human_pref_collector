        "Title: Emotional Appeals in Politics: A Multidisciplinary Investigation of Persuasion and Decision-Making\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the role of emotional appeals in shaping citizens' political choices and the strategic use of emotions by politicians. By analyzing the interplay between emotional appeals and citizens' emotional attachments, this research aims to clarify when and why emotional appeals are effective in persuasion. Furthermore, it will examine whether politicians have indeed increased their use of emotional appeals over time and identify the underlying motivations for this trend.\n\nUsing a unique dataset of politician speeches from 1945 to the present in 9 countries, this project will develop and test three theoretical frameworks explaining the strategic use of emotions in politics. Innovative methods, including automated text analysis and physiological measurement, will be employed to quantify emotional appeals and citizens' emotional responses.\n\nBy integrating insights from party politics and political psychology, this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the importance of emotions in citizens' decision-making and the rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. The findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the emotional dynamics underlying political behavior and decision-making, shedding light on the complex interplay between emotions, persuasion, and politics."

With highly emotive language people like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen are pounding on the portals to power. Do such emotional appeals affect citizens’ political choices? Yes, they can. But, citizens’ existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders or issues moderate the success of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theory and use novel methods to explain when (types of) emotional appeals are persuasive, and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. Do politicians actually make more emotional appeals than in the past? And if so why are they doing it? We lack historical data of emotional appeals so we cannot answer these questions. POLEMIC will provide unique, historical data (1945-now, 9 countries) of emotional appeals by politicians in their speeches. I develop and test 3 alternative theories from different intellectual traditions that explain why politicians make emotional appeals: is it either (1) a vote-maximizing strategy, (2) a product of the personality of a politician or (3) just fashionable? POLEMIC analyses emotional appeals of politicians and the emotional responses of citizens to these appeals. Emotional appeals are texts, and emotions are experiences by the brain. To measure them POLEMIC will use innovative methods in political science: automated text analysis to extract emotion from appeals; physiological measurement to measure emotions. POLEMIC offers a ground-breaking combination of a macro-perspective (what politicians say) and a micro-perspective (how citizens respond) and forms a bridge between party politics and political psychology. The project’s output will indicate the importance of emotion in the decision-making of citizens, and the level of rationality that is behind politicians’ decision to make emotional appeals.",
