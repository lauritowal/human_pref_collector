        "Title: Unveiling the Dynamic Nature of Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nAbstract:\n\nElucidating the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes is crucial for understanding the human mind. However, existing research has predominantly adopted a static approach, examining isolated stimuli and adult developmental stages. This proposal seeks to bridge this gap by investigating the dynamic properties that underlie conscious and unconscious processes through a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nOur research will proceed along three complementary tracks. Firstly, we will utilize Gaze-Contingent Substitution to study the dynamic unconscious processing streams generated by sequentially presented stimuli. Secondly, we will employ the Bayesian framework to examine how prior knowledge influences conscious perception by reconstructing missing information. Lastly, we will investigate the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures and high-density EEG, shedding light on the developmental trajectory of consciousness.\n\nThis project aims to provide novel insights into the sequential and complex nature of subliminal influences, the cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual illusions, and the maturation of consciousness in humans. By adopting a dynamic perspective, our research will significantly advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between conscious and unconscious mental processes, ultimately contributing to the development of more comprehensive theories of the human mind."

Most research on this topic has been limited to a static perspective, by studying static stimuli, by considering processing as a function of present information, and by focusing on a single, adult stage of development. Yet, both conscious and unconscious mental processes are intrinsically driven by dynamic properties. We will study these properties by relying on behavioral and brain imaging methods along three tracks: 1) Unconscious perception: Our visual system is, in real life, constantly receiving unconscious sequences of information that will generate dynamic and constantly updated processing streams. We will study these dynamic unconscious streams, thanks to Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel approach allowing for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. 2) Conscious perception: Construction of a conscious percept does not only depend on present stimulation but also on interactions with prior knowledge. Relying on the Bayesian framework, we will study the mechanisms by which prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents, by \"filling-in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness. 3) The maturation of consciousness: Using both psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, we will study the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants, and whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information, or rather anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control. The expected impact of the project will be 1) to evidence sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions 3) to provide new insights on the mystery of how consciousness develops in humans.",
