        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the study of ethnographic and archaeological collections by shifting the focus from individual objects to the broader socio-political context of their translocation. By introducing the concept of Art World Patterns, our multidisciplinary approach will explore the complex networks and relationships that have shaped the collecting of cultural material over time. Through a combination of quantitative analysis, network analysis, and data mining, we will analyze a large corpus of provenance data from 12 museums in 9 countries, focusing on Indigenous Latin American material collected in Europe between 1850-2000. Our research aims to develop innovative models for provenance research, providing a comprehensive understanding of the collecting practices and discourses that have influenced the representation and understanding of Indigenous Latin America in Europe. By reconstructing the historical context of collection formation, this project will contribute significantly to the field of museum studies, cultural heritage, and the decolonization of knowledge."

Moving away from the current focus in provenance research on single objects, collectors, or institutions, the aim of the project is to reconceptualize provenance as the large-scale study of the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material. To do so, it introduces the concept of Art World Patterns, an expansion and reframing of the idea of Art Worlds (Becker 2008[1982]). These patterns will be identified through an innovative combination of various data-driven methodologies. By applying quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data, the project will explore the promises and limitations of different data-driven approaches in the context of large-scale ethnographic/archaeological provenance research. Through this process, the project will devise new models for provenance research in ethnographic and archaeological museums. These conceptual and methodological advances will be mobilized through the study of Indigenous Latin American material from 12 museums in 9 countries. The project will create a ground-breaking diachronic, international, and cross-institutional understanding of the collecting of Indigenous Latin American material in Europe. In doing so, the BECACO team will reconstruct how – through the formation of collections – the Indigenous Latin American Art World as it existed in Europe between 1850-2000 constructed a discourse of art, aesthetics, and academic research that shaped how Indigenous Latin America is represented and understood in Europe until today.",
