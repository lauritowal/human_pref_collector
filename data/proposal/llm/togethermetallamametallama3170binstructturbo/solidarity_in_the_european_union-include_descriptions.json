        "Title: A Framework for Socioeconomic Justice in the European Union\n\nThis project aims to develop a normative understanding of solidarity as a fundamental value in European integration, and to apply this understanding to pressing EU policies. We seek to establish the principles of socioeconomic justice that should govern the relationships between European citizens and member states, and to determine the grounds of these obligations. The project will consist of two main components: first, the development of a normative model of solidarity that accounts for the EU's unique history and circumstances; and second, the application of this model to key issues such as migration, refugee policy, economic transfers, and EU enlargement. By exploring the role of solidarity in the EU, this project will contribute to ongoing debates on international justice, the EU's development, and the intersection of facts and normative theory."

Do European citizens have obligations of social justice that cross the borders of member states? If so, what are their grounds? I propose to answer these questions by providing a normative account of one of the fundamental values underpinning European integration, namely solidarity. The project has two main aims. The first is to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity that is responsive to the specific circumstances and history of the European Union (EUSOL1). The second aim is to apply this model to a number of central issues dividing the EU, including the free movement of persons, burden-sharing within the EUâ€™s refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). The project breaks new ground in normative debates on the nature and development of the EU, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory, and addresses some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today.",
