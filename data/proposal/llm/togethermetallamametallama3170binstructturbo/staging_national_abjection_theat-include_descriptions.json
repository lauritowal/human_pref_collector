        "**Title: Performing Borders: Theatre and the Politics of National Abjection**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project explores the intersections of theatre and national identity, examining how the performance arts have shaped and contested the boundaries of the Turkish nation. By investigating a range of theatrical productions from the late Ottoman period to the present day, we will analyze how theatre has been used as a tool for national abjection, as well as a site of resistance and negotiation for marginalized communities. Through a transdisciplinary approach, combining archival research and ethnographic methods, we will examine case studies including Armenian, queer, Islamic, Sephardic Jewish, and Alevi theatres in Turkey and its diasporas. This research will provide new insights into the complex relationships between artistic performance, citizenship, and national identity, shedding light on the cultural politics of illiberal democracies and post-Imperial contexts. By focusing on the Turkish case, this project will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of theatre in regulating belonging in the nation-state, and its implications for diasporic and refugee communities in Europe."

This research will analyse how theatre has served the processes of national abjection, and how abjected minorities have used theatre to negotiate the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas. Employing a rigorous transdisciplinary theoretical and methodological framework, the project will study the key role theatre has played in the constitution of “the Turkish nation” and its Others. Staging National Abjection covers the period from the rise of European-style theatre in the Ottoman Empire in the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Using both mainstream and alternative archives and ethnographic research methods, the project will investigate topics of vital importance that have received limited academic attention: theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide; negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas; Islamic theatre in Turkey and its European diasporas; Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe; and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. These case studies will bring different perspectives to the issue of national abjection, and provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre responding to pressures of a conservative neoliberal government. Using the case of Turkey as a vantage point, this project will ask critical questions of broader theoretical significance about the role of theatre in regulating the politics of belonging in the nation-state, and about the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. This research will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, advance our understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and provide ground-breaking insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.",
