        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, POSTNORM, seeks to explain the divergent trajectories of left-wing parties in Poland and the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal. It also explores the variation in protest behavior among right- and left-wing individuals in Eastern Europe. Building on the premise that the legacy of authoritarian regimes continues to shape contemporary politics, POSTNORM proposes a novel theory that the ideological associations of the old regime influence the norms governing party competition in new democracies. Through innovative survey experiments, this study will investigate how these associations impact voter preferences, party stances, national identity, and party elite discourse. By examining the demand- and supply-side dynamics of party competition, POSTNORM aims to develop a parsimonious theory that accounts for the heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies, providing new insights into the complex relationship between authoritarian legacies and democratic politics."

Why has Portugal been one of the last countries in Western Europe to see a radical right party in the national parliament? Why are right-wing individuals more likely to protest in Eastern Europe than left-wing individuals (Kostelka and Rovny 2019)? POSTNORM proposes a theory postulating that these seemingly unrelated patterns are the product of a single process: the rejection of the ideological brand of the past authoritarian regime. Through novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will examine how in new democracies, the ideological associations with the old regime serve as a focal point for norms that govern what are appropriate political positions for voters and parties: in democracies following left(right-)wing dictatorship, voters and political elites avoid associating themselves with the left(right) respectively. POSTNORM further derives a set of testable expectations about how this bias shapes both the demand- and the supply side of party competition. The bias colors citizens’ ideological preferences; perceptions about parties’ stances in these issues; national identity; political discussions; the supply of new parties; post-transition party names and pro-grammatic stances; and party elite discourse. POSTNORM will deliver a parsimonious new theory that will help make sense of heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies",
