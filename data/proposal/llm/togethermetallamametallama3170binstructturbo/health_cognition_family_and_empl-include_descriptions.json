        "**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Changing Life Circumstances on Men's Health and Cognition\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nGender disparities in mortality rates persist, with men being more likely to die prematurely due to preventable factors. Enhancing men's health and cognitive abilities is crucial for achieving gender equality and unlocking their full potential to contribute to families, the workforce, and society. This project aims to explore how shifting family and work dynamics influence men's health and cognition across adulthood.\n\nRecent trends show men lagging behind women in education, experiencing job losses due to technological advancements, and facing rising rates of childlessness. Additionally, traditional male roles as family breadwinners are evolving, with increased participation in childcare. Despite these changes, research on their impact on men's health and cognition remains limited.\n\nThis study leverages rich Norwegian population data, including genetic information, health records, and employment data, to investigate the relationships between men's changing life circumstances and their health and cognition. Focusing on young adulthood and midlife, we will examine cohort and period differences, the intersection of work and family life, and the effects of fathers' involvement in childcare. By analyzing a large dataset of over 12,000 men across various life stages, this project seeks to disentangle selection and causality, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex factors influencing men's health and cognition."

Improving men’s health and cognition is not only critical for achieving gender equality, but also for enhancing and extending men’s potential to contribute to their families, the labour market and society as populations grow older. HOMME studies how men’s (changing) family and working lives influence their health and cognition. Men’s family and working lives are changing: Men now lag behind women with regards to tertiary education; female labour participation has increased while male labour participation has slightly decreased. Men are more apt to lose their job due to technological change. Male childlessness has risen dramatically, much more than female childlessness; in many Western countries, one out of four or almost one out of three men are now childless at age 40. Fathers are participating more in childcare, and men have partially lost their role as family “breadwinners”. So far, insufficient research has examined the consequences of these changes on men’s health and cognition. HOMME capitalizes on the richness of Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data to examine how men’s (rapidly changing) family and working lives are related to their health and cognition across adulthood, as well as across cohorts, periods and between communities. We focus on young adulthood and midlife – the life period most characterized by family transitions and work experiences. We examine cohort and period differences, men’s work-face interface, the male breadwinner model and fathers’ participation in childcare, and disentangle selection and causality. Our data covers genes; parents, (former) spouses and partners; self-reported, clinical, and register measures of health; register data on work participation and occupation; and cognitive trajectories of N=12,000+ men between the late teens to ages 36 to 69 (and potentially beyond, pending funding of the project).",
