        "**Title: Exploring Labor Unions and Care-Related Leave Policies: A Comparative Analysis**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the role of labor unions in shaping national leave policies that support work-life balance, particularly for caregivers and those requiring self-care. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, we will analyze the relationships between labor unions and care-related leave policies across rich democracies since 1965, with in-depth case studies in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. Our research will identify predictors of union influence on policy, distinguishing between different types of social provisions, union characteristics, and worker representation. We will also examine the mechanisms of potential union influence and compare union-policy relationships across various institutional contexts. By integrating comparative policy analysis and social movement research, this project seeks to advance our understanding of labor unions' impact on social policies promoting sustainable work. The project will also develop longitudinal, comparative data on care leave provisions, providing a valuable resource for future research. Ultimately, our study aims to assess the potential of labor unions as partners in developing social policies that support a better balance between work and family responsibilities."

Social policies that make time for family and self-care are important tools for building sustainable work, but countries vary considerably in the extent to which such tools are available. Trade union organizations may play an important role for developing statutory care-related leave rights and protections, particularly as women still provide a bulk of family caregiving and now constitute a majority or near-majority of union members in many countries. This project will use a novel mixed-method design to investigate organized labour’s relationships to national leave policies that grant time-off from work to address care needs, including leave to care for a child, aging parent, or ill spouse or to address self-care needs through sick leave or disability benefits. Quantitative analyses will examine union-policy relationships across rich democracies starting in 1965, and qualitative analyses will examine organized labour’s policy advocacy in Ireland, France and the Netherlands. Analyses of predictors will distinguish between different types of social provisions, consider differences in trade unions and the types of workers they represent, investigate the mechanisms of potential union influence over policy, and compare union-policy relationships across different institutional contexts. A central ambition is to integrate the interdisciplinary fields of comparative policy analysis and social movement research to advance comparative labour studies and develop new theories of union-policy relationships. The project will additionally develop data infrastructures, offering much-needed longitudinal, comparative data on different types of care leave provisions. Overall, the project will assess the extent to which organized labour can be a partner for developing social policies that promote sustainable work for the future.",
