        "Title: Investigating Labor Market Flexibility: Causes, Consequences, and Implications\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe increasing prevalence of alternative work arrangements, such as outsourcing and flexible scheduling, has significantly impacted labor markets worldwide. While greater labor market flexibility is often seen as a key driver of economic growth, its effects on the distribution of resources in society, particularly regarding wage inequality, remain unclear. This project aims to shed light on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, exploring the relationship between job contract flexibility, technological advancements, worker preferences, and the role of labor market institutions and policies.\n\nBy combining register data, large-scale experimental evidence on worker preferences, and an exhaustive corpus of job vacancies, this study will provide a detailed analysis of both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. Using a combination of experimental and structural methods, the project will investigate the impact of labor market flexibility on wage inequality, gender wage gaps, and the distribution of rents between workers and firms. The findings of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics driving labor market flexibility, ultimately informing the development of effective labor market policies to promote equitable economic growth."

At the core of these major developments is the degree of flexibility in the labor market. Alternative work arrangements, e.g., outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs have become a common feature of labor markets across the globe. While most economists would argue that labor market flexibility facilitates reaping the benefits of globalization and technology growth, these developments can have far reaching consequences for the division of resources in society. Indeed, the recent decades have witnessed a sharp rise in wage inequality. LABFLEX is motivated by these developments and seeks to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. LABFLEX raises a series of questions: Do differences in job contracts reflect shifts in worker preferences, or do they mirror advances in technology that facilitate gains from organizing job tasks differently? What are the impacts of flexibility in job contracts on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers being compensated for the adverse work conditions or the higher income risks, or do changes in job contracts reflect changes in the sharing of rents between workers and firms? How do labor market institutions affect flexibility? And what is the role of labor market policies? To answer these questions, LABFLEX will for the first-time link register data to large-scale experimental evidence on workersâ€™ stated preferences for a wide array of work and pay arrangements, and an exhaustive full-text corpus of vacancies with information on job attributes. This will allow drawing a very detailed picture of both the supply and the demand side of the labor market, facilitating a study of flexibility in job contracts. Combining these data with experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility.",
