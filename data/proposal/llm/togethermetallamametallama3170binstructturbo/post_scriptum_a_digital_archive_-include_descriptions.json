        "**Project Title: Unveiling Hidden Voices**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to systematically collect, edit, and analyze a vast array of personal letters from the Early Modern Ages (17th-early 19th century) in the Iberian Peninsula. Focusing on correspondence seized by the Inquisition and civil courts, the project will uncover the voices of diverse social agents, including ordinary people whose lives intersected with these institutions. By analyzing these letters alongside accompanying inquisitorial and judicial records, researchers will gain a nuanced understanding of interpersonal relationships within traditional communities. The collection will showcase a rich, oral rhetoric that conveys emotions, common sense, and non-orthodox beliefs. Through a rigorous, digital edition adhering to Textual Criticism standards, this project will provide unprecedented access to Early Modern popular discourse, shedding new light on the cultural and linguistic practices of the time."

The documents in question are original epistolary writings made by servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, political fighters, and many other types of social agents whose paths were crossed by the prosecuting ways of the Inquisition and the civil courts, two institutions that used to seize personal correspondence as instrumental proof. Since the documents are accompanied by the ‘sociological interviews’ carried out by inquisitors and judges, they allow researchers a well-contextualized study of traditional communities in their inter-personal modes of relation. The sources’ texts contain very frequently an (almost) oral rhetoric through which emotions were expressed, commonsense was stated, non-orthodox beliefs were confessed and trivial incidents were narrated. Until now, it has been difficult to discover more than thin samples of this Early Modern ‘popular’ discourse. The P.S. project will not only assemble a large collection of it, but it will also match its philological treatment – an online digital edition following Textual Criticism standards – with the cultural and linguistic study of its contents.",
