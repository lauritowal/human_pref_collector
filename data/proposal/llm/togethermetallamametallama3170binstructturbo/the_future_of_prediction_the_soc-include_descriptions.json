        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project addresses the transformative impact of algorithmic prediction on social institutions and the management of uncertainty. As Big Data and Machine Learning enable precise forecasting, traditional probabilistic approaches to uncertainty are being challenged. With a focus on three key domains – personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing – we will investigate the implications of this shift on established practices and social structures. Our research will examine the intersection of individualization, generalization, and bias in digital forecasting, highlighting the tensions between algorithmic prediction and existing methods. By exploring the consequences of this transformation, our project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding the social, technical, and theoretical dimensions of prediction in the digital age. Through a set of theory-driven empirical studies, we will provide insight into the challenges and opportunities presented by the algorithmic turn, shedding light on the future of uncertainty management in a data-driven society."

Recent advances in digital forecasting claim to provide a predictive score for individual persons or singular events, thereby introducing a new way to manage the uncertainty of the future. But knowing the future in advance is not only advantageous. In fact, for our society, uncertainty about the future is also a resource. Since modernity, with the support of probability calculus various social institutions in different domains have developed means of coping with ignorance of the future by starting with the one thing that we all share – uncertainty. What happens to the stabilized forms of management of the future when their first resource – shared uncertainty – is missing? There is still no systematic research on this groundbreaking transformation. This project proposes a set of theory-driven empirical studies of the transition from probabilistic forms of uncertainty management to the new algorithmic forms of prediction. We will investigate three important social areas highlighting three fundamental dimensions with which digital forecast must deal. 1) First we will focus on personalized insurance. Here the key dimension is individualization of prediction, where the challenge is that such prediction could undermine the mutualization principle organized around actuarial practices. 2) Our second research area is precision medicine, highlighting the dimension of generalization where the challenge is the combination of algorithmic procedures with established statistical methods. 3) In the third field, predictive policing underscores the problem of bias while it challenges the distinction between prevention and repression. Exploring these transformation and its consequences, the project aims at developing a comprehensive approach to study the social, technical and theoretical aspects of prediction in digital society",
