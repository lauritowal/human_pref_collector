        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the complex dynamics of boat refugees and their interactions with various actors at sea and on land. By examining multiple instances of mass boat migrations across different time periods and regions, including the Mediterranean, South China Sea, Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Aden, we aim to understand how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary shaped the experiences and reception of these refugees.\n\nFocusing on the interplay between boat refugees, non-state actors, and state authorities, our research seeks to identify patterns of cooperation and conflict that influenced the journeys of these refugees. We will investigate the presence of solidarity among boat refugees, the responses of merchant vessels, fishing boats, and NGOs, as well as the policies and actions of governments towards boat refugees at sea and upon arrival.\n\nThrough a comparative and transnational approach, this project breaks new ground by centering the analysis on the seas as a critical site of migration, examining the roles of non-state actors, and comparing the experiences of boat refugees across time and space. Our research will draw on a diverse range of sources, including interviews, oral histories, state archives, NGO collections, legal cases, and media coverage. By shedding light on the complex dynamics surrounding boat refugees, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing these vulnerable populations."

This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 198In 2015, over one million boat refugees sailed across the Mediterranean. This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 1980s and 1990s, Cubans and Haitians tried to navigate the Caribbean to reach the US; and in the 1990s and 2000s, boat refugees sailed across the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Australia, Yemen, and Europe respectively. The central research question framing this project is: how did notions of solidarity, sovereignty and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? The research team will be guided by the related sub-question: who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? Each of the sub-projects will examine a) whether there was solidarity onboard between boat refugees, b) whether boat refugees encountered solidarity from non-state actors, such as merchant vessels, fishing boats and NGO search and rescue missions, c) how states responded to boat refugees at sea, and d) whether boat refugees attained sanctuary after their journey. This projectâ€™s ground-breaking character lies in three aspects: 1) thinking through seas, 2) going beyond the state, and 3) comparing the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space. The main sources that the project will rely upon will be interviews with boat refugees, non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage.",
