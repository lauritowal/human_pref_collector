        "**Title: TransOcean - A Thalassographic Analysis of Asian Fisher Mobilities in Africa and Oceania**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe expansion of China's and Vietnam's fishing fleets into African and Oceanian waters has significant implications for global marine ecosystems and trade. Contrary to the commonly held assumption that fishers are mere instruments of state agendas, this project proposes a novel approach to understanding the complex motivations and networks driving this phenomenon. By employing relational and shifting multiple mobilities as a conceptual framework, TransOcean will chart the intersections and collisions between Asian fishers and their Pacific and African counterparts. Through fine-grained ethnographic research, this study will examine how individuals and groups of fishers navigate multiple occupations, incomes, and networks to facilitate transoceanic expansion. By breaking down territorial boundaries and focusing on specific on-shore nodal points, TransOcean will provide a fresh perspective on the interconnectedness of global fisheries and the illicit seafood trade. This project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the drivers of marine trespass and inform policy responses to these pressing environmental and social issues."

Scholarly analysis has largely assumed that fishers are instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations and incentives. This both obscures the actual motivations and modalities of fishers’ expansion of their fishing grounds and downplays the transoceanic networks connecting different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting this spike in maritime trespass, TransOcean will analyze and theorize how individuals and groups of fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader and smuggler, and how the emergent mobilities of Asian fishers interact and collide with those of Pacific and African fishers. Deploying the innovative concept of relational and shifting multiple mobilities and employing thalassographic analysis, TransOcean develops a novel theoretical and methodological framework of fishers as mobile maritime actors who exploit their multiple occupations, incomes and networks to pursue transoceanic expansion. TransOcean studies, for the first time, diverse groups of interconnected fishers outside of territorially bounded fisheries and area studies, by analyzing mobilities beyond sea-borne migration or diasporic settlement. Though multi-scalar and globally oriented TransOcean remains firmly rooted in fine-grained ethnography, with a focus on Vietnamese and Chinese and African and Pacific fishers in specific on-shore nodal points, connected by the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. Thus, TransOcean breaks new methodological and theoretical ground for tackling intractable marine problems of significant scientific and policy value.",
