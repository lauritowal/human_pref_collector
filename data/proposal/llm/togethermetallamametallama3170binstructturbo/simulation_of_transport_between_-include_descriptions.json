        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a multidisciplinary investigation into the role of Roman inland transport in the prosperity of the Roman Empire. Despite its significance, transportation has long been overlooked in Roman elite discourse. Recent research has highlighted its crucial impact on the empire's economic cohesion and longevity. Our project, titled 'Roman Inland Transport Dynamics,' aims to develop a dynamic computer simulation model of water and land-based transport networks between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube River. This model will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, enabling insights into the empire's economic cohesion. Additionally, the project will analyze the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system and integrate dynamic simulations into historical research.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, our project will involve three interconnected strands: the reconstruction of ancient land and water routes, experimental analysis of transportation performance under varying environmental conditions, and the development of a time-based simulation system incorporating topographic and weather data, transportation modes, and human factors. Our modular design will ensure the sustainability and adaptability of the simulation model for future applications. By focusing on a diverse range of landscapes, our research will provide a versatile framework for exploring transportation dynamics in various historical contexts."

Therefore, it is an absolute desideratum to explore Roman inland transport transdisciplinary, combining recent technological developments with experimental data and profound historical research to gain the most realistic transport times. The objective of STRADA is the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system for water and land borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube. Thereby, STRADA is geared to three aims: a) the study of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, for gaining a better understanding of the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire, b) the analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system, c) and the introduction of dynamic simulations into historical research. For the implementation, the project will focus on three closely interwoven strands: The exact reconstruction of the ancient land- and water-routes, the experimental determination of the performance of the used land- and water-borne means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and the development of a time-related simulation system including local fine granular topography and historical weather data, different means of transport (water- and land-based) with different loads, the fatigue of the actors as well as necessary rests and loading times. STRADA will follow a modular design that will ease the sustainable use and a future extension of the simulation system. The chosen research area covers a wide range of landscapes from the Mediterranean lowlands, followed by different kinds of alpine regions, to a central European river landscape, which makes it easy adaptÂ¬able to other times and places.",
