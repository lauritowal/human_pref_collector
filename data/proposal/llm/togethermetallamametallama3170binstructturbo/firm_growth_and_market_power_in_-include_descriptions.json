        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the pursuit of a more dynamic and competitive economy, understanding the decision-making processes of firms is crucial for designing effective policies. This research project, titled \"Unveiling Firm Growth and Market Power,\" aims to provide novel insights into the welfare and policy implications of globalization. By deviating from the traditional paradigm of efficient markets, this study focuses on the dominant role of large firms in the global economy and their impact on market power. The objective is to investigate how firm decisions influence the aggregate benefits of globalization, the distribution of these benefits among individuals, and the implications for policy design.\n\nOver the next five years, this project will integrate more nuanced firm behavior into international trade models to analyze the effects of trade and industrial policies on growth, particularly in less developed markets. Key research questions include: How can policy ensure consumer benefits from globalization when firms with market power engage in international trade? How do domestic policies supporting agribusiness firms affect small farmers' gains from trade? What is the impact of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages? And how does banking globalization influence the growth of firms in the real sector?\n\nThis project will combine theoretical analysis with rich data from developing economies to expand our understanding of trade and industrial policy, ultimately informing evidence-based policymaking. By shedding light on the complex relationships between firm growth, market power, and policy, this research will contribute to the development of more effective policies for a globalized world."

The objective of my future research is to provide such an analysis. BIGlobal will examine the sources of firm growth and market power to provide new insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Much of analysis of the global economy is set in the paradigm of markets that allocate resources efficiently and there is little role for policy. But big firms dominate economic activity, especially across borders. How do firms grow and what is the effect of their market power on the welfare impact of globalization? This project will determine how firm decisions matter for the aggregate gains from globalization, the division of these gains across different individuals and their implications for policy design. Over the next five years, I will incorporate richer firms behaviour in models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact the growth process, especially in less developed markets. The specific questions I will address include: how can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms engaged in international trade have market power, how do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect the extent to which small farmers gain from trade, how do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages, and what is the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector. Each project will combine theoretical work with rich data from developing economies to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and to provide a basis for informed policymaking.",
