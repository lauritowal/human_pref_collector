        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe prevailing narrative of moral progress posits a gradual expansion of moral consideration to increasingly broader groups, transcending arbitrary boundaries of class, age, and species. However, this \"expanding circle\" account is hindered by the inherent limitations of human psychology, where empathy and altruism are predominantly reserved for those within our immediate social circles. This project proposes an alternative framework for understanding moral progress, one that explores diverse forms of moral advancement beyond the expanding circle model. By examining novel moral attitudes less constrained by evolutionary pressures and investigating the potential of institutional innovations to circumvent the limitations of human psychology, this research aims to reevaluate the prospects for moral progress and demonstrate that they may be more promising than previously thought."

Full moral status was only accorded to people of a certain class, age, gender, ethnicity, or religion. Over time, the moral franchise was gradually extended, however imperfectly, to include human beings of all races, creeds, or genders. Eventually, even species membership is recognized as morally irrelevant, and the moral circle is extended towards non-human animals as well. Many influential ethicists call this the “expanding circle” of moral concern. Moral progress, on this account, consists in further expansions of the moral realm beyond ethically arbitrary features. This account, however, faces a serious feasibility problem: our moral concern is limited due to features of our evolved psychology. Empathy is parochial; altruism remains tied to friends and kin. This project will develop an alternative theory of moral progress. By focusing on different forms of moral progress other than the expanding circle, different moral attitudes which are not subject to the same evolutionary constraints, and smart institutions that can bypass the limits of our inherited psychology, it will be shown that the prospects of moral progress have been severely underestimated.",
