        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nTitle: Comparative Analysis of Morality Policy Evolution (CAMPE)\n\nCAMPE seeks to advance our understanding of morality policy development through an innovative, multi-method approach. By examining the evolution of morality policies across 25 OECD countries over three decades (1980-2010), this project addresses a significant knowledge gap in policy analysis. The study focuses on three key subfields of morality policy: life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances. Unlike existing research, CAMPE adopts a holistic perspective, aiming to explain patterns of policy change at the field level rather than individual policies.\n\nTo achieve this, the project employs a mixed-methods design, combining macro-quantitative analysis of legislative output data with qualitative case studies of \"critical\" cases that challenge the theoretical model. By identifying the factors that influence morality policy change, CAMPE contributes to the development of comprehensive theories that account for changes in entire policy fields. The findings of this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and the broader public, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics shaping morality policy."

First, MORAPOL takes an innovative empirical focus. It is the first to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies. This policy area is so far unexplored from a policy-analytical perspective. The focus is on changing patterns of morality policy over time, across countries and policy subfields. The project compares morality policies in 25 OECD countries over a period of thirty years (1980 \u0013 2010). It involves a comparison across different subfields of morality policy, including (1) policies on \"life and death\" (abortion, euthanasia), (2) sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality) and (3) addictive substances and addictive behaviour. Second, the project is conceptually innovative. The theoretical aim is to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields rather than for individual policies or policy items. This holistic approach constitutes a path-breaking departure from existing concepts. This way, it is for the first time possible to develop theories that account for changes in whole policy fields or subfields. To systematically assess the influence of international and domestic factors on morality policy change, MORAPOL adopts a mixed-methods approach. In a first step, a macro-quantitative analysis is undertaken, based on legislative output data for the subfields and countries under study. This analysis is in a second step complemented with qualitative case studies. The case studies are selected on the basis of the results of the quantitative study, which turn out to be “critical” cases; i.e. cases that are apparently incorrectly predicted by the theoretical model.",
