        "**Title: Investigating the Impact of Technological Advancements on Corporate Governance and Investor Welfare**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to examine the effects of technological advancements on corporate governance, shareholder interactions, and investor welfare. The study will focus on three key areas: (1) the shift to virtual shareholder meetings and its implications on shareholder-firm communication, (2) the relationship between corporate environmental and social (ES) statements and actual ES actions, and (3) the impact of employee characteristics on equity-based compensation (EBC) in the tech industry.\n\nUsing a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including natural language processing, this study will investigate whether technological advancements have improved corporate transparency, accountability, and social responsibility. Initial findings suggest that the shift to virtual shareholder meetings may have reduced shareholder engagement, while corporate ES statements may not accurately reflect actual ES actions. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that employee characteristics, such as gender, may influence EBC outcomes in the tech industry.\n\nThis study seeks to provide insights into the complex relationships between technology, corporate governance, and investor welfare, with implications for policymakers, investors, and corporate stakeholders. By examining the impact of technological advancements on corporate governance and investor welfare, this research aims to contribute to a more informed understanding of the benefits and limitations of technological innovation in the corporate world."

Technology is changing how investors interact with companies, how investors analyze and interpret the information provided by companies, and even the standard design of compensation in corporations. The goal of this study is to understand whether and how the increasing presence of technology is improving corporations and contributing to the wealth and prosperity of individuals/ investors, and when it is not. I will focus on the following three pillars that each focus on a unique technological development: (1) Communication with shareholders. Aim: To understand whether shareholders’ voice at shareholder meetings is muted following the shift of shareholder meetings from the in-person to the virtual-only arena (due to Covid-19). Initial findings indicate that this shift has minimized communication between shareholders and firms and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing questions submitted by shareholders. (2) Environment and social (ES) issues. Aim: To understand whether investors pay attention to what firms say they do on ES issues, or what they actually do. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to evaluate which actions firms state that they take with respect to ES, and these will be compared to the ES actions firms actually take. Initial results indicate that the market rewards firms that state they take actions promoting ES goals, but not firms that actually take such actions. (3) Compensation. – Aim: To examine how the characteristics of employees (e.g., gender) working in the tech industry relate to the EBC they receive, and their ability to maximize the value of their EBC and changes the economic landscape and welfare of individuals.",
