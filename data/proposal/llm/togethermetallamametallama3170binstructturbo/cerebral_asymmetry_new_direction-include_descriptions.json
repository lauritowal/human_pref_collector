        "**Title: Unraveling the Enigma of Functional Cerebral Asymmetry: A Multidisciplinary Approach**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nDespite 150 years of research, the fundamental basis of functional cerebral asymmetry, a hallmark of human language, remains elusive. This project aims to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating impaired language development through an innovative combination of genetic and neuropsychological approaches. Our novel network efficiency hypothesis posits that optimal language development relies on the organization of key language functions within the same cerebral hemisphere.\n\nThis comprehensive study comprises five interconnected projects. We will employ a multimodal methodology, including behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, to identify individual differences in language lateralization patterns. We will also examine the relationship between language function representation and the risk of language and literacy impairment, as well as the role of genetic factors in shaping language lateralization. Furthermore, we will investigate the impact of neurodevelopmental abnormalities on language deficits and inconsistent asymmetry, and search for rare genetic mutations associated with atypical language laterality patterns.\n\nBy integrating these diverse approaches, this project seeks to provide a major breakthrough in understanding the complex mechanisms underlying functional cerebral asymmetry, ultimately shedding light on the quintessential human characteristic of language."

I propose that by studying cases of impaired language development and combining genetic and neuropsychological approaches we will be able to make a leap forward in our understanding of the quintessentially human characteristic of functional cerebral asymmetry. I argue that contradictory findings in the literature may be reconciled if we adopt a novel approach to cerebral asymmetry. In particular, I propose a network efficiency hypothesis which maintains that optimal development depends on organisation of key language functions within the same cerebral hemisphere. In project A, I will combine behavioural measures with functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) measures of blood flow and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralisation. In project B I will test the prediction that risk for language and literacy impairment is increased if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres. For project C, simulations of predictions from genetic models will be tested using data on twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralisation. Project D will test a 'double hit' genetic model that predicts that neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including language deficits and inconsistent asymmetry, arise when there is more than one hit on a functional brain circuit. For this study we will use an existing sample of individuals already known to have one 'hit' on the neuroligin-neurexin circuit, viz people with an additional dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome. Project E will focus on individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality and will look for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with a departure from consistent left hemisphere language.",
