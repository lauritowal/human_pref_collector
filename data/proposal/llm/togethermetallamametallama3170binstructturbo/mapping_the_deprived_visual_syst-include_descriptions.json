        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal seeks to elucidate the intricate relationship between crossmodal plasticity and visual recovery in individuals with blindness. The occipital cortex, traditionally viewed as dedicated to visual processing, undergoes significant reorganization in response to visual deprivation, adapting to process non-visual inputs. The proposed study aims to investigate how visual deprivation at distinct developmental stages influences the functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. Furthermore, it will apply this knowledge to predict and assess the outcomes of sight restoration interventions. By bridging the gap between cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, this research will advance our understanding of how experience shapes brain region response properties. The findings will ultimately inform the development of predictive assessments for sensory restoration, enabling more effective treatment strategies for individuals with visual impairments."

These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity, classically considered compensatory, inevitably raise crucial challenges for sight-restoration. The neglected relation between crossmodal plasticity and sight-recovery will represent the testing ground of MADVIS in order to gain important novel insights on how specific brain regions become, stay and change their functional tuning toward the processing of specific stimuli. The main goal of MADVIS is therefore to make a breakthrough on two fronts: (1) understanding how visual deprivation at different sensitive periods in development affects the functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex; and (2) use the fundamental knowledge derived from (1) to test and predict the outcome of sight restoration. Using a pioneering interdisciplinary approach that crosses the boundaries between cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, MADVIS will have a large impact on our understanding of how experience at different sensitive periods shapes the response properties of specific brain regions. Finally, in its attempt to fill the existing gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, MADVIS will eventually pave the way for a new generation of predictive surveys prior to sensory restoration.",
