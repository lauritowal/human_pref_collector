        "Title: A Novel Methodological Framework for Investigating Complex Social Constructs\n\nAbstract:\n\nUnderstanding the relationships between abstract social constructs, such as beliefs and values, is crucial for addressing pressing societal issues like climate change, polarized politics, and vaccine hesitancy. Large-scale survey data is often used to study these phenomena, but traditional regression methods neglect the inherent measurement error and variability in group-specific processes. This proposal seeks to develop and implement a mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework to overcome these limitations, enabling more accurate and nuanced investigations of complex social constructs.\n\nThe proposed framework will address three primary challenges: (1) accounting for measurement error in survey items, (2) identifying and comparing group-specific processes across multiple groups, and (3) addressing non-invariance in measurement models. By clustering groups with common underlying processes and employing flexible measurement models, this framework will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors driving polarized beliefs and values. The methods will be implemented in freely available software, facilitating widespread adoption and advancing the field of social sciences."

For example, do values affect climate change beliefs? Do perceived threats predict political beliefs? Do risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation determine vaccine hesitancy? Polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination are a societal threat and it is important to study what drives them. Large-scale survey data is gathered to do so. Using regression to answer the questions ignores that constructs are not directly observable, but measured by survey items containing measurement error (challenge 1). Not correcting for this causes the studied effects to be underestimated and conclusions to be misguided. When many groups are involved - such as many countries in the European Social Survey - the underlying processes likely differ across groups. For example, drivers of climate change beliefs may differ for countries experiencing extreme weather. Group-specific or multilevel analyses result in numerous group-specific regression slopes or random effects, making it hard to find which regression effects are different or similar for which groups (challenge 2). Across many groups, the constructs' measurement is often inequivalent or 'non-invariant', for example, due to translation (challenge 3). A measurement model indicates how items measure a construct and disregarding non-invariance in this model invalidates the comparison of effects among constructs (i.e., one may find differences that are actually due to non-invariance). By tackling challenges 1-3, the proposed mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework provides the tools to break new ground in understanding what drives constructs like polarized beliefs. A clustering finds subsets of groups with common processes. Flexible measurement models account for non-invariance so that the clustering focuses on the processes. I will implement the methods in freely available software.",
