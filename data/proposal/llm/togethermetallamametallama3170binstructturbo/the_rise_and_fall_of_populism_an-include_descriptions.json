        "**Title:** Understanding the Roots of Populism: Economic Shocks, Personal Experiences, and Information Environments\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe recent surge of populist movements in advanced democracies has raised crucial questions about the drivers of this phenomenon. This project seeks to investigate the relationship between economic shocks, personal experiences, and information environments in shaping individuals' political decisions. Through a three-part study, we aim to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the rise of populism.\n\nFirst, we will analyze the impact of personal employment histories and information environments on voting behavior in the US, leveraging a unique database of over 40 million resumes matched with economic and voting data. Second, we will explore how negative social experiences during formative years affect subsequent life outcomes and support for populist agendas, using a novel dataset on corporal punishment in UK schools and its effects on educational attainment, employment, and voting behavior.\n\nLastly, we will examine the determinants of resistance to extremist regimes, using a historical case study of opposition to the Nazi regime in Germany during WWII. By analyzing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and combining it with data on bombing and foreign propaganda exposure, we hope to shed light on the factors that drive individuals to resist extremist ideologies despite high personal costs. This project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex factors driving the rise of populism, ultimately informing strategies to mitigate its effects."

Is populism caused by negative economic shocks? If so, what are the mechanisms? What explains heterogeneity in responses to such shocks? In this project, I will test empirically if personal experiences, information environment, and their interaction with aggregate economic shocks shape peopleâ€™s political decisions. The project consists of three parts. First, I will study how personal employment histories, potentially affected by globalization and technological shocks, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting for Trump. I will use a unique database of more than 40 million resumes for the period 2010-2016, the largest available repository of resumes of job-seekers in the US, which was not previously used in academic research, and match it with zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, I will study how negative social experiences during the formative years affect subsequent labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and the support of populist agenda. I will examine how corporal punishment in schools in UK affected subsequent educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting for UKIP and Brexit. I will digitize archival records on regulations and practice of corporal punishment in different educational authorities in the UK during 1970-80s, combining it with contemporary outcomes. Third, I will examine what makes people actively resist extremist regimes even when it is associated with high personal costs. I will study a historical example of resistance to Nazi regime in Germany during the WWII, which provides unique methodological opportunity to study determinants of resistance to extremism in a high stake environment. I will use a self-collected dataset on treason cases to measure resistance, combining it with data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda.",
