        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nDespite the long-standing recognition that government structures have evolved over time, the causes and consequences of these changes remain poorly understood. Traditional explanations emphasizing the role of political parties have limitations, particularly in light of the decline of party government worldwide. Furthermore, existing research on government structural change has focused primarily on its effects on democratic and economic outcomes, neglecting the impact on policy formulation.\n\nThis project seeks to address these knowledge gaps by exploring the transformation of units within ministries and agencies as the fundamental building blocks of the modern state. By developing a novel theory of evolutionary government, we will investigate the interplay between a unit's structural features and its organizational and environmental environment, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of change. Our approach will also examine the effects of structural change on government policy, a critical aspect that has been overlooked in previous research.\n\nTo support our empirical analyses, we will construct a comprehensive dataset spanning six countries from 1815 to 2025, featuring approximately 150,000 units. Leveraging methodological advancements from biology, such as data assimilation techniques, we aim to analyze the origins and consequences of structural change in government, as well as forecast future changes. By injecting a predictive dimension into government studies, this project promises to make a significant contribution to our understanding of government evolution and its policy implications."

Traditionally, the answer refers to political parties exercising control over a state bureaucracy. Yet government structures have been changing ever since they emerged alongside the modern state and thus already before parties existed. The recent decline of party government worldwide also begs the question whether other actors and mechanisms matter that have been underestimated so far. Meanwhile, it became a truism that “structure shapes policy”, but existing research focuses on other effects of structural change in government, such as democratic and economic outcomes or cabinet governance. We lack systematic analyses of how structural change affects government policy. To address these gaps, STATE-DNA studies the change of units inside ministries and agencies as the ‘building blocks’ of the modern state. It submits a novel theory of evolutionary government that regards structural change in government as an interplay between a unit’s structural features and its organizational and environmental environment. This notion of multiple levels allows to study more than ‘party-centric’ causes of change and, for the first time, to analyze the effects on government policy explicitly, as evolutionary consequences managed by distinct units. STATE-DNA breaks new ground by applying genetic measures to assess structural change in government, establishing the most comprehensive data set, which begins with the ‘primordial soup’ of the early 19th century when government structures fragmented (~150,000 units, six countries, 1815–2025). For the empirical analyses, existing (historical) data on legislative activity, organizational, and environmental features will be used and extended. STATE-DNA will exploit methodological advancements in biology, such as data assimilation techniques, to analyze the origins and consequences of structural change in government and to forecast such change, thereby injecting a predictive notion into government studies.",
