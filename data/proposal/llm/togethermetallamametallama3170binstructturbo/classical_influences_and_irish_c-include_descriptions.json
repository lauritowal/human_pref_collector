        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the distinct yet underexamined relationship between Ireland's cultural heritage and the classical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome. Despite Ireland's geographical isolation from the Roman Empire, the island boasts an exceptionally rich legacy of classical learning, spanning its earliest recorded literature to the present day. Through a multi-thematic analysis of nine key areas - including language, travel, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, and material culture - this research will investigate the unique characteristics of classical reception in Ireland. By bridging disparate disciplines such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, literature, philosophy, and global studies, this project aims to illuminate the significant role of classical culture in shaping Ireland's literary, social, and political discourse across centuries. Furthermore, it will contextualize this historical dynamic within contemporary debates surrounding Ireland's complex past, including the legacy of the island's division and the ongoing commemoration of its foundation as an independent state. By shedding new light on this underexplored history, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the enduring impact of classical culture on Ireland's identity and its ongoing relevance in modern times."

Unlike Britain and mainland Europe, Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire. Yet the island has an extraordinarily vibrant tradition of classical learning that dates back to its earliest recorded literature, and is unparalleled in other northern European countries. Research for this project will address why this is the case, by examining sources through nine significant diachronic themes identified by the PI: language; land; travel and exile; Troy; satire; Neoplatonism; female voices; material culture; and global influence. This multi-thematic approach will enable analysis of what is remarkable about classical reception in Ireland. It will also provide a heuristic framework that generates dialogue between normally disparate fields, such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English-language literature, Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project will engage with contemporary preoccupations surrounding the politics and history of the divided island of Ireland, such as the current decade of centenary commemorations for the foundation of an independent Irish state (1912-1922, 2012-2022), and the on-going violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. These issues will serve as a springboard for opening new avenues of investigation that look far beyond the past 100 years, but are linked to them. The project will thus shed new light on the role of classical culture in shaping literary, social, and political discourse across the island of Ireland, and throughout its history.",
