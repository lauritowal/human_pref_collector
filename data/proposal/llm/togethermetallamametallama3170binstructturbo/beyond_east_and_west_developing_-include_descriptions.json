        "**Title: Bridging Musical Heritage and Contemporary Concert Music in Turkey**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to overcome the challenges of integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music and opera. By establishing a series of research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, we aim to develop practical processes for creating a new strand of East-West contemporary music. Key objectives include training traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers in performing a new repertoire, as well as educating Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques. We will also investigate the impact of this music on musicians' adaptive processes and audience perceptions, and design an innovative ensemble interface to facilitate the merging of Eastern and Western sounds.\n\nOur research will culminate in a team-authored e-book, featuring a comprehensive orchestration manual for Turkish instruments, groundbreaking studies on timbre, and a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems. This project not only seeks to break down cultural barriers in music but also offers a transdisciplinary model for understanding the creative imagination and its role in transcending cultural differences. By fostering a deeper understanding of the intersections between traditional and contemporary music, we hope to contribute to a more inclusive and diverse musical landscape."

But differences in tuning, texture, and between oral and notated orientations to performance have presented seemingly intractable obstacles. This project systematises practical processes essential for the creation of a new, East-West strand of contemporary music and opera. It initiates cutting-edge research workshops in Istanbul, Holland and the UK to: 1. Train top-level traditional instrumentalists and singers in Turkey effectively to perform a new repertoire; 2. Train top professional Western singers in non-Western techniques and nuances of vocal production; 3. Develop approaches for modelling such music's impacts on Turkish and Western musicians’ adaptive processes in rehearsal and performance, and diverse audiences’ perceptions of such music; 4. Create an ensemble interface (including newly designed instruments) to increase capacity for merging sounds beyond levels now achievable; 5. Produce groundbreaking studies on timbre to provide new insights into how sound is produced; 6. Establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems onto one another. This research, together with an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds will comprise the core of a published (CUP) team-authored e-book, Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), with included audio and visual examples linked as an online resource. Looking further, this project’s multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach also suggests a model for probing how the ‘free play’ of the imagination (Kant) possible within processes of art and its creation can provide metaphors towards understanding one of the most urgent and compelling issues of our time: how to transcend cultural barriers (real or imagined) that exist today.",
