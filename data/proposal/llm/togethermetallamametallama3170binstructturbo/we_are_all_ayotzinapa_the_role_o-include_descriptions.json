        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project investigates the pivotal role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, focusing on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The digital landscape played a crucial role in mobilizing citizens and generating a counter-movement against the government. By adopting a dual approach, our research combines theoretical and multidisciplinary perspectives to analyze the intersection of digital memory and disappearance. We conceptualize disappearance as a distinct crime that challenges traditional categories, creating a new ontological status for the disappeared. This transgression of boundaries is mirrored in the digital sphere, where memories are mediated by technology and blur distinctions between past, present, and future.\n\nOur study situates the Mexican case within a broader transnational context, drawing comparisons with Argentina and Spain's histories of disappearance. We examine how digital platforms, social performances, and artistic representations shape the collective memory of disappearance across these nations. By constructing a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects in networked social movements, our research aims to redefine the relationship between media and memory in the transnational arena. This project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between digital media, memory, and social movements, providing valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and human rights advocates."

It investigates a novel case that is in process of shaping: the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. The role of the new media in getting citizens’ attention and in marking a “turning point” was crucial to the upsurge of a counter-movement against the Mexican government and qualifies the event as significant for the transnational arena. The groundbreaking aspect of the project consists in proposing a double approach: a) a theoretical approach in which “disappearance” is considered as a particular crime that becomes a model for analyzing digital memory. Disappearance is a technology that produces a subject with a new ontological status: the disappeared are non-beings, because they are neither alive nor dead. This ontological status transgresses the clear boundaries separating life and death, past, present and future, materiality and immateriality, personal and collective spheres. “Digital memory”, i.e. a memory mediated by digital technology, is also determined by the transgression of the boundaries of given categories b) a multidisciplinary approach situating Mexico´s case in a long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World, including Argentina and Spain. This longer history seeks to compare disappearance as a mnemonic object developed in the global sphere –in social network sites as blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube– in Mexico and the social performances and artistic representations –literature, photo exhibitions, and films– developed in Spain and Argentina. The Mexican case represents a paradigm for the redefinition of the relationship between media and memory. The main output of the project will consist in constructing a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects in the rise of networked social movements with a transnational scope.",
