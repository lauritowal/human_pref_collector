        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project proposes a novel investigation into the role of gamma waves in information transmission and synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Building on the predictive coding theory, we challenge the conventional view that gamma waves carry prediction errors and instead hypothesize that they signal predictability and facilitate long-range gamma-synchronization between columns with shared visual input predictions. To test this theory, we will develop a new method for quantifying predictions and prediction errors in natural vision using state-of-the-art deep-learning networks. \n\nCombining multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans (MEG), we will examine the relationship between predictability, gamma waves, and their synchronization patterns. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of experience and perceptual learning on gamma wave activity. Using optogenetics in marmosets, we will assess whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning and explore the role of top-down feedback in V1 gamma wave activity.\n\nThis research aims to provide critical insights into the function of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions, ultimately contributing to a unified theory of gamma wave activity. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying gamma wave activity, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders and inform novel therapeutic approaches."

These waves are believed to be essential for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Their impairment is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, it remains heavily debated what gamma waves encode, and what their precise role in information transmission is. I have recently proposed a new theory about gamma in visual cortex, building on the predictive coding theory. The predictive coding theory holds that the brain makes active top-down predictions about its own sensory inputs. By comparing these, it generates bottom-up prediction errors to drive learning and the updating of priors. The standard view in predictive coding theories is that gamma waves carry prediction errors. However, I recently hypothesized the opposite: 1) Gamma waves signal a match between predictions and sensory inputs (i.e. predictability), and 2) Columns that predict each other's visual input engage in long-range gamma-synchronization. To test this hypothesis, it is critical to develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in the context of natural vision. I will solve this by using recently developed deep-learning networks for prediction. By making multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans (MEG), I will test if predictability indeed determines gamma waves and their synchronization pattern across space. Because stimulus priors have to be acquired through learning, I will further determine whether gamma waves depend on experience and perceptual learning. In marmosets, I will develop an optogenetics approach to test whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning, and test the prediction that V1 gamma waves depend on top-down feedback. In sum, I expect to provide evidence for a new, unified theory about the role of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions.",
