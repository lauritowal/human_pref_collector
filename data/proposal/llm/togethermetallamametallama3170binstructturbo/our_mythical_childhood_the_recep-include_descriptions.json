        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to revolutionize the study of Classical Antiquity's reception in contemporary children's and young adults' culture by transcending traditional Western-centric approaches. Our innovative methodology recognizes the inherent value of regional contexts in shaping the reception of Antiquity, and we aim to conduct comparative studies across diverse geographical locations, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. By examining the dynamic and creative ways in which young people engage with Classical Antiquity, we will gain a deeper understanding of the complex social, cultural, and political transformations underway in these regions. Our project will yield a comprehensive, supra-regional survey of classical references, in-depth analyses of key reception cases, and practical materials for using ancient myths in inclusive education settings. This groundbreaking research, led by an international team of scholars, promises to have a profound impact on the fields of scholarship, education, and culture, fostering greater integration, cultural exchange, and a more nuanced understanding of the shared human experience. By harnessing the power of Classical Antiquity's global influence, we can inspire new perspectives, promote cross-cultural understanding, and empower young people to become active participants in shaping their own cultural identities."

This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients’ identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children’s and young adults’ culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and – a bold but necessary step – in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity – through the reception filter – to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.",
