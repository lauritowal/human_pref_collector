        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research program addresses the pressing issue of multiculturalism in crisis, evident in the growing concerns over ineffective coexistence policies and rising ethno-religious tensions worldwide. By adopting a comparative approach, the project will investigate the everyday practices of ethno-religious coexistence in diverse settings, seeking to understand how individuals and communities spontaneously manage and accommodate difference. Through an in-depth examination of ordinary coexistence, this study aims to identify the cultural resources and mechanisms that facilitate civil relations and mitigate conflict between different groups. By shifting the focus from policy effects to community practices, this research will illuminate the unexplored dimensions of coexistence, shedding light on the values, worldviews, and expectations that underlie successful interactions. Ultimately, this project seeks to broaden the theoretical and normative understanding of coexistence, highlighting the significance of culture and existing practices in navigating the complexities of diversity. By doing so, it will inform the development of more effective and culturally sensitive approaches to promoting harmonious coexistence in multicultural societies."

Over the past decade, growing and increasingly mainstream voices have declared multiculturalism to have failed, in such places as Europe, the United States, India, Israel, to name a few. In view of growing concerns over the ineffectiveness of current coexistence policies, and brewing ethno-religious conflicts, this research program will address this issue by taking a comparative approach to the question of ethno-religious coexistence in multiple sites. By examining cases of “ordinary” coexistence in situations of religious and ethnic diversity, the research seeks to understand how coexistence is actually practiced. The Praxis of Coexistence seeks to open an entirely new empirical, inductive, and comparative line of inquiry that does not seek to examine the effects of different policies on coexistence, but rather looks at coexistence practices to, among other things, achieve better policy. Understanding how people handle diversity spontaneously will enlighten us about what they “expect”, what they are looking for in coexistence. I ask: How do communities accommodate difference in spontaneous and culturally resonant ways? What resources do they actually draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict and violence between the different religious and ethnic groups that cohabit the same space? This project will open theoretical and normative space for a broader range of approaches to coexistence, ones that are attuned to questions of deep difference, divergent worldviews, and diverse values. In contrast to studies on the effects of policy or structural conditions on the dynamics of coexistence, this project will demonstrate why we should also take culture and existing practice seriously when considering the dilemmas of diversity.",
