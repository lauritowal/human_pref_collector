        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to revolutionize the understanding of how interpersonal interactions influence mental health by introducing a novel concept: individual-specific synchrony signatures. Contrary to the prevailing \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, our research posits that each person has a unique synchrony profile that manifests across various social interactions. We propose that tailoring interactions to an individual's synchrony signature is crucial for fostering curative relationships.\n\nFocusing on the therapeutic relationship between a client and therapist, our study will investigate the existence and mechanisms of individual-specific synchrony signatures. We will employ a multimodal approach, incorporating motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to distinguish between trait-like synchrony signatures and state-like deviations. Furthermore, we will develop a pioneering multimodal feedback system to facilitate personalized changes in synchrony and examine their causal relationships with mental health outcomes.\n\nBy shedding light on the complex, individual-specific nature of synchrony, our findings will provide a deeper understanding of how human connections impact mental health. This knowledge will pave the way for the development of more effective, personalized interventions, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic potential of social interactions."

But how such interactions affect mental health is poorly understood. SynSig suggests that interpersonal synchrony is an individual-specific mechanism underlying curative relationships. It seeks to go beyond the one-size-fits-all “the higher the synchrony the better” theoretical assumption underlying the state of the art research. It is the first to propose that individuals have their own individual-specific trait-like synchrony signature as manifests across interacting partners. It further proposes that to make interactions curative, it is necessary to induce an individual-tailored correction to such a signature. That is, the amount and direction of the changes in synchrony must be guided by the individual’s synchrony signature. To develop an individual-specific understanding of synchrony, SynSig focuses on curative interactions encapsulated in time and space: the therapeutic relationship between the client and therapist. It will investigate the existence of individual-specific synchrony signature and how individual-tailored correction of the signature serves as the mechanism transforming relationships into curative ones. It will implement multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) for disentangling the trait-like synchrony signature and state-like deviations from it, of individuals participating in multiple dyadic interactions with humans and virtual humans. The first multimodal feedback system on momentary deviations from the signature will be developed and used to facilitate individual-tailored changes in synchrony and draw causal inferences between such changes and mental health outcomes. The findings will provide new insights into the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and bring us closer to understanding how human connections affect our mental health.",
