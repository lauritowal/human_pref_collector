        "**Title: Understanding Patterns of Political Participation in Contentious and Non-Contentious Politics**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nAs citizens worldwide engage in protests, demonstrations, and movements for social change, questions arise about the evolving dynamics of political participation. Is there a shift from traditional party politics to contentious forms of engagement, and what drives individual involvement in politics? The proposed research project addresses these questions through a multi-faceted, comparative study of participation in contentious and non-contentious politics across different countries and contexts.\n\nBy analyzing the interplay between individual motivations, organizational appeals, and societal constraints, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors that shape political engagement. The research design consists of four interconnected sub-projects: a meta-analysis of existing literature, a comparative analysis of global survey data, focus group discussions in eight countries, and experimental surveys to quantify patterns of participation.\n\nBy examining the complex dynamics of political participation, this project seeks to contribute to the development of more democratic societies. A better understanding of how and why citizens engage in politics can inform strategies to promote active citizenship and strengthen democratic institutions."

Some argue that contentious politics gains importance and party politics declines. Is that so and why would that be? Why is it that some individuals engage in politics while others remain apathetic? Why is it that some citizens take the electoral route, while others engage in contentious politics? The truth is that we do not really know. Should we bother? I think we should. Citizens who are actively involved in politics are an asset to democracy. Understanding how and why people take part in politics would help to build more democratic societies. The proposed project compares participation in contentious and non-contentious politics in various countries within a single theoretical and methodological framework. A central tenet of this research proposal is that sooner or later every citizen might get involved in politics. I seek the reason why in the interplay of dynamics at the individual, the organizational, and the societal level. What are the motives people have? What are the appeals parties and movement organizations disseminate; and what are the opportunities and constraints regimes impose? Comparison is the core of the project. It encompasses four subproject: (1) a meta-analysis of publications on movement and party politics combined; (2) comparisons of political participation over time and countries in existing global survey data; (3) focus group discussions to understand the formation of political engagement and disengagement in four ‘old’ democracies (the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, U.S.A.), two post-communist ‘new’ democracies (Hungary, Poland) and two post-authoritarian ‘new’ democracies (Brazil, Argentina); (4) experimental focused surveys among 1000 respondents to quantify patterns of political participation in the same eight countries.",
