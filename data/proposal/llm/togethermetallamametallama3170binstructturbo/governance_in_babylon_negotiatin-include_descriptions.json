        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project, \"Exploring Governance in Ancient Babylon,\" aims to shed new light on the dynamics of governance in the ancient city of Babylon, a pivotal urban center in the ancient Near East. By analyzing recently accessible Neo-Babylonian archival texts from the German excavations in Babylon, in conjunction with archaeological findings, we seek to understand how imperial rule was negotiated at the local level during the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian empires (late 8th to 4th century BC). Our research will apply the conceptual framework of governance studies to investigate the complex interactions between rulers and ruled, and how these interactions influenced the stability and instability of the state.\n\nThrough this project, we hope to challenge prevailing modern perceptions of 'oriental' governance as absolute or despotic, and contribute to a broader understanding of the factors that lead to stable or unstable states, and the success or failure of regime changes. By adopting a governance-focused approach, which emphasizes the interdependencies and interactions between actors, we will provide a more nuanced understanding of politics and authority in ancient Babylon. The insights gained from this project will not only enhance our knowledge of ancient governance but also inform contemporary debates on state governance and stability."

Babylonia is the earliest society in the ancient world that produced sufficient indigenous sources that allow studying the transition from a strongly anchored local to a more ‘global’ (imperial), de-nationalized form of governance. From the late 8th to the 4th century BC, Babylon experienced two major regime changes and was consecutively ruled by three empires – the Assyrian, the Chaldean and the (first) Persian. While the regime changes and other events are known as historical facts, little is known about how imperial rule was negotiated locally and how the strategies which rulers and ruled applied in pursuit of their interests interacted and led to instability or stability. The reasons are incomplete historical data, and difficulties to interpret available ambivalent or conflicting data. With GoviB I want to achieve a novel understanding of politics and authority in the ancient city of Babylon, leading to a new balanced evaluation of the role which the empires played in the long-term cultural transformation of the ancient Near East. The results will contribute to a re-evaluation of modern perceptions of ‘oriental’ governance as absolute or ‘despotic’, and to the wider question of what causes states to be stable or instable, and how regime changes fail or succeed. I will achieve these goals by analysing newly available textual and archaeological material: the Neo-Babylonian archival texts from the German excavations in Babylon. The Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin granted me the rights to put this museum treasure trove to use for GoviB. Furthermore, I will apply the conceptual framework of governance studies to the historical evidence. Its heuristic value lies in the fact that it relocates the focus from government to governance, that is, the interdependencies and interactions between actors, and it includes non-personal factors that influenced decision-making.",
