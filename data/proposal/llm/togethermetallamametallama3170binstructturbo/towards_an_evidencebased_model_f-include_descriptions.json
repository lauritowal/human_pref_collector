        "**Title: Enhancing Big Data Policing through Interdisciplinary Research and Evaluation**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nBig data policing holds promise as a proactive approach to reducing crime rates by leveraging historical data to forecast high-risk areas. However, despite the potential of this strategy, several research gaps hinder its effective implementation in Europe. The current state of knowledge is fragmented, and a lack of interdisciplinarity among studies has resulted in an incomplete understanding of big data policing's complexities. Furthermore, there is a dearth of scientific evaluations of existing models, making it challenging to assess their effectiveness and reliability.\n\nThis project aims to bridge these gaps by developing an evidence-based, interdisciplinary model of big data policing. By integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions, we will create a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of big data policing strategies. A series of randomized controlled trials will test the model, ensuring its validity and reliability. To foster a deeper understanding of big data policing, we will also establish PhD tracks focused on each of these dimensions. Our approach prioritizes transparency, accountability, and scientific rigor, distinguishing it from commercial initiatives that often lack these essential safeguards. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide a robust foundation for the development and implementation of effective big data policing strategies in Europe."

Big data policing models can consist of variables based on crime data available in police databases (e.g. previous crime events), socio-economic data (e.g. poverty index, residential mobility), opportunity characteristics (e.g. the presence of shops, distance to nearest highway), data from new technologies (e.g. intelligent cameras) and other known predictors of crime (e.g. police patrol intensity). However, there are several research gaps that need to be addressed. First, knowledge about and expertise in big data policing in Europe is currently fragmented. Second, there is a lack of interdisciplinarity with regard to big data policing studies, and yet the involvement of several disciplines is required when studying the issue. Third, there is a lack of scientific evaluations of big data policing models. The overarching objective of this ERC project is to unite and integrate the statistical-methodological, criminological, legal and ethical dimensions of big data policing in an evidence-based model that will be tested by different randomized controlled trials and built on the principles of an international (i.e. European) and interdisciplinary approach. The latter aim should be enabled by incorporating and conducting different PhD tracks focusing on these specific dimensions, which should allow better knowledge, insights and understanding of big data policing to be developed. This approach is innovative and radically different from the existing commercial and economic initiatives, which lack transparency on their predictive reliability and validity, effectiveness and legal and ethical safeguards.",
