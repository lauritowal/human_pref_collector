        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project aims to address the knowledge gap surrounding the relationship between poverty eradication and climate change, bridging the divide between global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the energy needs and climate change impacts associated with achieving decent living standards globally.\n\nWe will investigate three core questions: What constitutes a decent standard of living, and what goods and services are required to achieve it? What are the energy requirements and corresponding climate change impacts of providing these goods and services in different countries and contexts? How do the energy needs of decent living evolve as countries develop and grow?\n\nUsing a combination of empirical analysis, lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modeling, we will examine the energy and climate implications of decent living in five emerging economies facing poverty eradication and climate mitigation challenges. Our research will identify opportunities for low-carbon development pathways and inform the design of burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. By providing a rigorous, evidence-based understanding of the relationship between poverty eradication and climate change, this project will contribute to the development of effective policies and strategies for achieving a more equitable and sustainable future."

This is due to knowledge gaps related to the material basis of poverty, and the relationship between energy and human development. Addressing this issue rigorously requires bridging gaps between global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, and applying this knowledge to projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This project will develop a body of knowledge that quantifies the energy needs and related climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all. The research will address three questions: which goods and services, and with what characteristics, constitute ‘decent living standards’? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what impact will this energy use have on climate change? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? The first task will operationalize basic needs views of human development and advance their empirical validity by discerning characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. The second will quantify the energy needs (and climate-related emissions) for decent living constituents and reveal their dependence on culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions in countries. This will be done using lifecycle analysis and input-output analysis, and mapping energy to climate change using state-of-the-art energy-economy integrated assessment modelling tools for 5 emerging economies that face the challenges of eradicating poverty and mitigating climate change. The third task will shed light on path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity using empirical analysis. This research will identify opportunities to shift developing societies towards low-carbon pathways, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation.",
