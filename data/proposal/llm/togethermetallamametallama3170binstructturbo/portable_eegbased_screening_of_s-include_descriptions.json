        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop an innovative, portable EEG-based device for assessing face processing in newborns. Research has shown that early predispositions to social cues, such as face-like stimuli, play a crucial role in guiding human social behavior and are often impaired in children with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). Early detection of these predispositions could serve as a valuable biomarker for ASD, enabling timely interventions that significantly benefit affected infants. Building upon previous research, this project seeks to create a wireless, low-power EEG system with dry electrodes and automated analysis capabilities, allowing for rapid and easy testing of face processing in newborns outside of laboratory settings. This device has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of ASD and enable large-scale screening protocols. Additionally, its adaptability makes it suitable for exploring the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns, offering a versatile research tool. The successful development of this device could have a profound impact on the diagnosis and treatment of ASD, as well as our understanding of early human development."

An early detector of social predispositions and their impairment in newborns might provide a valuable biomarker for ASD, an indicator of utmost relevance since infants with ASD greatly benefit from early behavioral intervention. This proposal builds on a study performed within my ERC grant in which, by designing an innovative oscillatory visual presentation of face-like patterns and perceptually equivalent controls, we identified an EEG-based index of face processing, present in each newborn tested and obtainable with less than 2 minutes of newborn’s visual attention. However, recording newborn’s EEG is currently possible only in laboratory settings, as no fully portable EEG system adapted for newborns exists in the market. The goal of this proposal is to design a portable, wireless EEG-based device that allows easy, rapid and automatic testing of face processing in newborns in any context, including their homes. This device is ground-breaking because it will combine the efficacy of our innovative experimental paradigm tailored to newborn’s restricted visual attention with a portable, low-power, wireless EEG device based on dry electrodes and an automatic algorithm that will extract on-line the EEG-based index of face processing. Its realization will enable the development of an early, objective and easy-to-test EEG-based biomarker on newborns at risk, potentially opening the way to large-scale screening protocols. Given the flexibility of the paradigm with respect to the content of the visual stimulation, this method might be used for research purposes to explore the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns.",
