    "title": "Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds",
    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nSafeguarding agrobiodiversity, particularly indigenous seeds and associated knowledge (ISK), is crucial for global food security and sustainable agriculture. However, the lack of economic incentives and inadequate tracking systems hinder the in situ conservation of ISK by farmers. This project proposes the development and testing of ReSeed, a novel digital platform utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate transparent, decentralized, and equitable transfers of ISK. By creating a digital farmers' market, ReSeed aims to incentivize honest reporting of downstream research and innovation, ensuring fair benefits for farmers.\n\nA mixed methods research approach will be employed to engage with suppliers and buyers of ISK in co-designing the technical features and incentives of ReSeed. The project will also examine the integration of ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks, requiring minimal legal amendments, and develop a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers' communities.\n\nReSeed will build upon existing research on incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds, promoting in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, and adding value to farmers' ISK. Ultimately, this project aims to bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers, while ensuring the long-term preservation of agrobiodiversity."

While indigenous seeds can be preserved in seed banks, problems of viability over prolonged storage and rapid climate change necessitate on-farm (in situ) conservation. However, farmers face dwindling economic incentives to cultivate and thereby conserve ISK in situ: ISK is ineligible for protection under intellectual property laws and there are currently no systems in place for tracking the end use to which ISK are put (e.g. end-user consumption or downstream research). The fundamental problem here is in tracing who the first farmer (group) was that put an ISK on the “market”, who accessed it, and what was done with it. Using features of blockchain technology that can help track the flow of ISK in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way, my goal is to develop and test a technical specification for a first-of-its-kind digital farmers’ market (ReSeed) that (i) facilitates equitable and traceable transfers of farmers’ ISK, and (ii) incentivizes honest reporting-back of downstream research and innovation therewith. Using a mixed methods research approach, I will conduct original empirical research with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that will inform ReSeed’s design. I will also demonstrate how ReSeed can be integrated into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments, and create a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers’ communities. ReSeed will build on my 12-year research on means of incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds. It will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers’ ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.",
