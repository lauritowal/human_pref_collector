        "**Title: Visualizing the Third Plague Pandemic: A Global Analysis of Photography's Impact on Public Health Consciousness**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the pivotal role of photography in shaping public perception of infectious disease and hygiene during the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). By examining the global visual record of the pandemic, we aim to illuminate how photography facilitated the emergence of bacteriological explanations and transformed public consciousness of health emergencies. Focusing on four regions – East Asia, India, Africa, and the Americas – our interdisciplinary team will analyze the visual representation of the pandemic, highlighting how it negotiated geopolitics, colonialism, and biopolitics at the turn of the 20th century. Our research will delve into four interconnected aspects of the visual record: the built environment, civil disturbance, death and burial, and the intersection of race, class, and discrimination. By collecting and analyzing visual documents from the pandemic, we seek to understand how photography established plague as a paradigmatic agent of death and disorder, while also facilitating a global negotiation of public health meaning. This project will contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between visual representation, public health, and global modernity."

The project will collect and analyse for the first time all visual documents of the third plague pandemic, which broke out in 1855 in Southwest China and raged across the globe until 1959, causing the death of approximately 12 million people. The project’s aim is to engage in a historical and anthropological analysis of this global network of visual representations, underlining how it played a crucial role in the negotiation of geopolitical, colonial and biopolitical relations at the turn of the 20th century, with great bearing on public health consciousness and the social imagination of a new era of globalised hygienic modernity. Research will focus on four regions: China and Japan; India; Africa; South and North America, the first investigated by the Principal Investigator, while the rest being allocated to 3 postdoctoral researchers, all employed full-time in the project. While investigating the visual record of plague in their respective regions, researchers will engage in a collaborative and interdisciplinary analysis of the entangled history of the visual representation of the third pandemic, taking as a common analytical ground 4 different but vitally interlinked aspects of the visual representation of the pandemic: a) the built environment; b) civil disturbance and public order; c) death, corpses and burial; d) race, class and discrimination.",
