        "**Title:** Mapping the Global Dispersal of Eastern Christians in the Early Modern Era\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nEastern Christians, once concentrated in the Ottoman Empire, now reside in diverse locations worldwide, from South America to Scandinavia. While often viewed as a recent phenomenon, this diaspora has deeper historical roots. This project seeks to uncover the interconnected histories of Eastern Christians in the early modern world by analyzing a vast array of literary, documentary, and printed sources from Europe, the Middle East, and beyond. A team of researchers, led by the Principal Investigator, will reassemble and examine these scattered sources, encompassing ten languages and numerous archives across three continents.\n\nBy bridging the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, this project addresses a pressing challenge in global history: linking micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives. Our methodology prioritizes philology and source criticism to produce a rigorous form of global history. The project's outcomes will include publications, workshops, and a searchable database of writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750. This groundbreaking research will provide a nuanced understanding of Eastern Christian migration and its global implications, contributing to a deeper appreciation of the complexities of early modern history."

Too often, however, this global migration has been seen purely as a modern development, one arising from contemporary political and confessional events in the Middle East, while in fact this phenomenon had its roots in the early modern period. From the sixteenth century onwards, Christians from the Ottoman Empire set out for distant worlds and foreign lands, travelling as far as Europe, India, Russia, and even the Americas and leaving traces of themselves across countless European and Middle Eastern archives, chanceries, and libraries. This transnational, ground-breaking project will gather all of these disparate sources into a single analytical frame to uncover, for the first time, the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Through the work of a team of researchers under the close supervision of the PI, the project will reconstitute and analyse a ‘lost archive’ of literary, documentary, and printed sources in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of archives. Under the expert leadership of the PI, the project will include a robust strategy for dissemination, which will successfully bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history. In doing so, this project will respond directly to one of the most pressing conceptual challenges facing global history today, that is, how to link the study of the micro-scale level of everyday life to the macro-narratives emphasised by global historians. Underlying this project, therefore, is a major intervention that seeks to advance a rigorous form of global history, and one which preserves philology and source criticism at the heart of its methodology. The outcomes of the project will include print-publications, workshops, and a searchable database of all writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750.",
