    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nEffective social interaction relies on our ability to share and maintain a common understanding of the world. However, studying the neural basis of this complex process poses significant challenges due to the intricacies of human brain function. Recent breakthroughs in brain signal analysis have made it possible to investigate social cognition in naturalistic settings with unprecedented precision. This project seeks to establish a comprehensive neurocognitive framework that integrates social psychology and cognitive neuroscience by examining how individuals develop and convey shared neural representations of their social environment. We propose to use cutting-edge signal analysis techniques and rapid neuroimaging methods to investigate three key research questions: (1) whether synchronized brain activity supports interpersonal understanding, (2) whether similar cognitive processes across individuals are associated with increased brain synchrony, and (3) whether intense emotional experiences enhance brain synchronization and facilitate social information exchange. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying social interaction, this study aims to contribute to a paradigm shift in our understanding of social cognition and its neural basis, ultimately advancing the fields of social and cognitive neuroscience."

Studying how social information is represented similarly across individual brains and how it flows from brain to brain poses huge conceptual and technical challenges for neuroscientists, who have consequently resorted to experiments using simplistic and impoverished social stimuli. However, recent advances in brain signal analysis enable us to study the brain basis of social interaction under naturalistic settings with unparalleled accuracy. This neuroimaging project aims to bridge the gap between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience by building a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The framework relies on testing the assumption that similarities in sensory and higher-order processing across individuals can be quantified by measuring temporal synchronization of their brain activity. We use novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition for testing i) whether selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, ii) whether similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with increasingly synchronous brain activity, and iii) whether intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and flow of information from brain to brain. The results will significantly improve our understanding of the brain dynamics of social interaction, and the proposed naturalistic neuroscience approach and will potentially contribute to a significant paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience.",
