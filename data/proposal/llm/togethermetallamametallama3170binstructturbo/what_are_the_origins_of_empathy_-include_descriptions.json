        "**Empathy Origins Across Species and Cultures: A Comparative Investigation**\n\nEmpathy is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, yet its evolutionary and developmental origins are poorly understood. Previous research has underestimated the capacity for empathy in infants and great apes, potentially due to methodological limitations. This project seeks to overcome these limitations by combining innovative techniques, such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, with longitudinal observations and experiments to investigate empathy development in humans and bonobos.\n\nBy comparing data on bonobo and human infant development in diverse cultural contexts, including two small-scale societies with varying societal structures and emotional expressivity, this project aims to deliver groundbreaking insights into the origins of empathy. Our hypothesis is that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans exhibit a greater motivation to alleviate others' emotional states and engage in reciprocal emotional exchange, leading to unique forms of cooperation and sharing.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach integrating biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, this project will significantly advance our understanding of empathy's origins and challenge current perspectives on its human uniqueness. By exploring the developmental and evolutionary roots of empathy, this research has the potential to transform our understanding of human nature and our relationships with others."

However, we lack knowledge about the origins of empathy and to what extent its sub-components reflect species and cultural universals. Studying infants and great apes enables us to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy and the extent of its human uniqueness. Until now, it has largely been assumed that infants and great apes lack the capacity for empathy. However, this claim may reflect a lack of adequate methodologies and research attention, leaving infant and great ape empathy underestimated. Now, combining novel techniques to investigate empathy comparatively (thermal-imaging, pupillometry and eye-tracking) with longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, EMPORIGIN will overcome this issue to provide the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Rich datasets on bonobo (wild and semi-captive) infant development and caregiver interactions will be compared to those from human infants in two small-scale, traditional societies – Vanuatu and Samoa. Both societies show distributed-caregiving but vary in societal structure and emotional expressivity. Using a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN will deliver step-change insights into empathy development that go far beyond the State-of-the-Art. We will test the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in a greater motivation to ameliorate others’ emotional states and a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. These capacities could lead to a cascade of human-unique forms of sharing and co-operation. Combining approaches across biology, psychology, ethology and anthropology, EMPORIGIN will advance our understanding of the origins of empathy, one of our most remarkable capacities, and challenge current perspectives about its human uniqueness.",
