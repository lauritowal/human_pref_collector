        "**Title: Inference Methods for Models with Unobserved Heterogeneity: Exploiting the Power of Longitudinal Data**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nUnobserved differences between individuals are a key factor driving variability in economic outcomes, such as education choices and employment duration. Incorporating this heterogeneity into economic models is vital but poses significant challenges in econometric analysis. This project aims to develop innovative inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by leveraging the identifying power of longitudinal data. The project is divided into three main components, each addressing a critical aspect of modern panel data applications. \n\nThe first component enhances statistical hypothesis testing for nonlinear models, shifting the focus from point estimation to inference and uncertainty quantification. The second component develops estimation methods for network data by treating it as a type of panel data, thereby addressing the importance of social and economic connections. The third component non-parametrically estimates dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved heterogeneity and latent state variables, a crucial tool in labor economics and industrial organization.\n\nThe performance of these methods will be assessed through theoretical analysis and simulations, with applications to various empirical problems, including labor force participation and international trade behavior. By developing and applying these innovative inference methods, this project seeks to provide more accurate and reliable insights into the complex relationships driving economic outcomes."

Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in economic modeling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. The aim of this project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three blocks. Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel data. The first block deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second block makes progress on the estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third block uses panel data to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and they will be applied to various empirical problems. Two examples of applications that we will study are the extensive margin of labor force participation and the determinants of the import and export behavior of firms and countries.",
