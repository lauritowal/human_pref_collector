        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project seeks to uncover the underlying drivers of human innovation by examining the emergence of sharp stone tool use in our evolutionary history. The development of intentional stone flaking marks a critical milestone in human technological advancement, providing our ancestors with the means to access high-value calories and laying the groundwork for the complexities of human culture. \n\nTo investigate this phenomenon, our study will employ a multi-faceted approach, incorporating objective behavioral analysis, experimental design, and comparative modeling. We will first establish a baseline understanding of stone manipulation behaviors in a range of non-human primate species, including chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. Next, we will experimentally evaluate the role of exposure and experience in driving innovation, utilizing large sample sizes and long-term testing protocols. \n\nOur analysis will be complemented by a comparative examination of primate stone tool assemblages and some of the oldest known human stone tools, allowing us to infer the timing of cognitive divergence between humans and other primates. By integrating these empirical findings with advanced modeling techniques, our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conditions necessary for innovation and, ultimately, the primers of human culture."

By identifying the conditions driving innovations across primates, we can provide new insight into when and how humans developed this unique culture. PRIMERS will address this need by adopting a systematic and holistic approach to testing the catalysts of a watershed behaviour in our evolutionary history: the ability to make and use sharp stone tools (flakes). The advent of intentional flakes in the human lineage marks the first clear divergence between animal and human technology. With tools to access high-value calories, our ancestors now had the physical and cognitive resources to lay the groundwork for our culture. PRIMERS will use a triangulation approach to follow the emergence of flaking in appropriate proxy models: wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. Objective 1 will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of these species using novel artificial intelligence coding methods. Objective 2 will test two other major drivers of innovations: exposure and experience. An experimental paradigm with in-built controls, large sample sizes (N =350), and long-term testing protocols (approx. 4 years) will be used to empirically evaluate the cognitive and developmental primers of innovations. Objective 3 will systematically compare primate assemblages to some of the oldest human stone tools, allowing for inferences to be made on when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Structural Equation Models will then determine the relative contributions and interactions between the measured factors. By testing three species, combining and upscaling experimental paradigms and implementing powerful modelling tools, PRIMERS will radically enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations, and with it, the primers of human culture.",
