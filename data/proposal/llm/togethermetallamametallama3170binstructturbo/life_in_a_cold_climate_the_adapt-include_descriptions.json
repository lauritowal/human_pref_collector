        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the role of environmental adaptation in the spread of agriculture throughout Europe, bridging the current gap in understanding the interplay between human and environmental factors in the domestication process. By leveraging recent advances in population genomics and ecological modeling, we will identify genetic loci in barley and wheat that have undergone selection in response to local environmental conditions since the introduction of cereal cultivation in Europe. Ancient DNA sequencing and computational methods will be used to date the timing of these adaptations.\n\nOur research will integrate these findings with existing data on the spread of agriculture in Europe, including pauses in the spread that may be linked to environmental adaptation, demographic trends indicating population decline in regions with inadequate crop productivity, and archaeobotanical records showing changes in cereal prevalence across different regions. By examining the complex relationships between environmental pressures, crop adaptation, and human migration, this project seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that shaped the establishment of farming in Europe. The proposed research has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of the dynamic interplay between human societies and their environments during a critical period in European history."

Archaeologists have long recognized that the ecological pressures placed on crops would have had an impact on the spread and subsequent development of agriculture, but previously there has been no means of directly assessing the scale and nature of this impact. Recent work that I have directed has shown how such a study could be carried out, and the purpose of this project is to exploit these breakthroughs with the goal of assessing the influence of environmental adaptation on the spread of agriculture, its adoption as the primary subsistence strategy, and the subsequent establishment of farming in different parts of Europe. This will correct the current imbalance between our understanding of the human and environmental dimensions to the domestication of Europe. I will use methods from population genomics to identify loci within the barley and wheat genomes that have undergone selection since the beginning of cereal cultivation in Europe. I will then use ecological modelling to identify those loci whose patterns of selection are associated with ecogeographical variables and hence represent adaptations to local environmental conditions. I will assign dates to the periods when adaptations occurred by sequencing ancient DNA from archaeobotanical assemblages and by computer methods that enable the temporal order of adaptations to be deduced. I will then synthesise the information on environmental adaptations with dating evidence for the spread of agriculture in Europe, which reveals pauses that might be linked to environmental adaptation, with demographic data that indicate regions where Neolithic populations declined, possibly due to inadequate crop productivity, and with an archaeobotanical database showing changes in the prevalence of individual cereals in different regions.",
