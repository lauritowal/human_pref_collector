        "Title: Investigating the Impact of Blockchain Technology on Distributed Governance and Trust\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proliferation of blockchain-based applications has the potential to revolutionize traditional power structures by providing a decentralized and \"trustless\" alternative to existing institutions. However, it is crucial to examine whether this technology merely shifts power from one center to another or genuinely offers a new paradigm for governance. This interdisciplinary project seeks to explore the effects of blockchain technology on existing and emerging governance frameworks, with a focus on legitimacy, trust, and power dynamics. By investigating the governance of existing blockchain systems, evaluating the sustainability of distributed governance models, and experimenting with novel architectures for decentralized decision-making, this research aims to contribute to the development of a new field of scholarship on distributed governance. Combining insights from computer science, political science, and law, this project will provide critical empirical and theoretical findings with significant policy implications for global governance. A dedicated and multidisciplinary research team will be assembled to undertake this high-risk, high-gain endeavor, requiring a funding scheme that accommodates innovative and visionary research."

Often described as a “trustless” technology, blockchain’s potential for disintermediation has been touted as a catalyst of innovation that could displace existing power structures. But is it shifting power away from former centers of power only to create new ones, or can it lead to an actual new organisation of power? BlockchainGov is an interdisciplinary project that will study the impact of blockchain technology on new and existing governance structures, and its consequences for legitimacy and trust. First, it will investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, and analyse the power dynamics at play within these systems. Second, it will examine the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of existing attempts at distributed governance, through the lenses of legal and political theory. Third, it will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new models of distributed governance providing an architecture for decentralized and participatory decision-making with attributes of transparency and accountability. Last, it will experiment with these new models at different levels of governance, from the community level to the global governance level. The project will open a new field of scholarship on “distributed governance” that uniquely combines the disciplines of computer science, political science and law. It will provide key empirical and theoretical contributions to science, with important policy implications to the broader questions of global governance. Bringing this project to life requires a funding scheme compatible with a high-risk/high-gain vision to finance a fully dedicated and highly motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills.",
