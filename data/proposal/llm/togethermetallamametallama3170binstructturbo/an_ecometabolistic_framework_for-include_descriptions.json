        "Title: Rethinking Sustainable Building Practices through Bio-Based Materials\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs the world grapples with material depletion, this interdisciplinary project seeks to revolutionize sustainable building practices by embracing a bio-based material paradigm. Despite mounting calls to action and legislative efforts, architecture has been slow to adapt. Bio-based materials, characterized by their complexity, unpredictability, and limited lifespans, require a fundamental shift in architectural thinking. This project identifies the key barriers to this transition and proposes a holistic eco-metabolistic framework to facilitate carbon-neutral, renewable, and optimized design solutions. By employing a research-by-design approach and advanced computational modeling, the project will explore three bio-based material perspectives and challenge traditional notions of design agency, building lifespan, and construction practices. Ultimately, this research aims to empower architects to rethink buildings as dynamic, co-present systems that require ongoing maintenance and intervention, paving the way for more sustainable, socially conscious, and democratic models of production."

Despite well-organised calls for action maturing into legislation and an attentive profession, architecture is proving reticent in this transition. Bio-based materials are fundamentally different to current building materials being characterised by their complex heterogeneity, unpredictable behaviours and limited lifespans. This project identifies that the key impediments to this transition lie with architectureâ€™s inability to represent, conceptualise and operationalise bio-based materials. It argues that to design with bio-based materials we must challenge the fundamental value proposition of architecture and expand our conception of material lifespan to find new practices of construction. It proposes a holistic eco-metabolistic framework, that allows for carbon-neutral, renewable and materially optimised design solutions. It employs a research-by-design method to investigate three bio-based material perspectives (glulam, bio-polymer composites and bioluminescent bacteria) and instrumentalises them through three advanced computational modelling networks for the predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication and environmental sensing of bio-based materials. It challenges our preconception of design agency as restricted to the traditional cut-off point of building completion, proposing new participatory practices of continual construction to recast the short lifespans of bio-based materials as effective properties of a new sustainable practice. By enabling us to think of buildings as co-present and actively engaged through processes of maintenance and intervention, the project responds to the search for sustainable, more socially conscious and more democratic models of production.",
