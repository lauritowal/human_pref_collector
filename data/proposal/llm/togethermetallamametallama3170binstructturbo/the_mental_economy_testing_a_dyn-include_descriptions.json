        "**Title: Working Memory in Context: A New Theoretical Framework**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nWorking memory (WM) is generally regarded as a limited-capacity system, but this limitation is mitigated in everyday life by the availability of external cues. However, the dominant theory of WM fails to account for the interplay between internal storage and external sampling when the external world remains accessible. This project proposes a novel theoretical model of WM, grounded in the concept of internal mental economy. The model posits that WM maintains a dynamic balance between internal storage and external sampling, trading off the costs of accurate storage against the benefits of external sampling.\n\nThrough a combination of innovative experimental paradigms, electroencephalographic decoding techniques, virtual reality technology, and the study of patients with specific cognitive deficits, this project aims to rigorously test the theoretical basis of the model. By examining WM in interaction with the physical environment, the project seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern WM and shed light on its role in everyday life. The proposed model has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of WM disorders, as well as for understanding human interaction with virtual environments in an increasingly digital world."

WM is therefore generally referred to as a limited-capacity system. This limitation is not a problem in daily life, however, because the external world typically remains available and can be accessed relatively easily. The current dominant theory of WM does not explain how the brain balances between internal storage and external sampling, as this theory exclusively relates to situations in which the remembered information is no longer physically present. The HOMEOSTASIS project is motivated by the idea that WM should be studied in interaction with the world that is still within view. HOMEOSTASIS will develop a new theoretical model of WM based on an internal mental economy: I propose that WM maintains a perceptual homeostasis by dynamically trading the costs of accurate internal storage against external sampling of the external visual world. Whereas current research on WM has a strong focus on its maximum capacity, this capacity may hardly be used as observers prefer to minimize internal storage due to the effortful nature of WM storage. I will rigorously test the modelâ€™s theoretical basis using novel experimental paradigms in which WM is studied in interaction with the physically present environment. To decode the current content of WM, I will adopt state-of-the-art electroencephalographic decoding techniques. To study WM in interaction with worlds of varying reliability and familiarity, I will employ virtual reality technology. Finally, I will investigate patients with restricted deficits to specific components of the model and use machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements. This new model of WM will open a new window to diagnose WM disorders and for understanding how we interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments in an increasingly computer-dominated world.",
