        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the impact of abrupt climate fluctuations on the demise of Neanderthals and the rapid expansion of Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) in southern Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. By analyzing 20 key archaeological sites across the region, we will reconstruct the subsistence strategies employed by both human species in response to climatic changes, using zooarchaeological and taphonomic methods to assess their adaptability and resilience. Local environmental conditions will be accurately reconstructed through stable isotope analysis of animal remains, providing a comprehensive and dated framework for understanding the ecological context. Additionally, we will develop a novel approach to estimate prey abundance, ecology, and human behavior, allowing us to quantify the carrying capacity of ecosystems and its impact on human populations. This interdisciplinary research will provide critical insights into the role of climate in shaping the fate of these two human species, shedding light on the factors that contributed to the success of AMH and the decline of Neanderthals. The results will have significant implications for our understanding of European prehistory and the complex relationships between human populations, climate, and environment."

Abrupt and acute oscillations of climate, as recorded from polar ice sheets, are particularly threatening as they can push ecosystems towards catastrophic outcomes. Under these conditions, the survival of a species critically depends on their adaptive skills. Understanding the exact role that these episodes could have had in the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition is then essential to unravel the real causes of Neanderthal demise and AMH success. To do this, SUBSILIENCE will identify the subsistence strategies adopted by both human species in response to those climatic changes at 20 key archaeological sites located across southern European peninsulas. By applying zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses, the behavioural flexibility and resilience of each human species will be assessed. In addition, to enable effective testing, local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions will be accurately reconstructed using stable isotopes from animals consumed, producing a unique, continuous and properly-dated general environmental framework, improving existing knowledge. Finally, to further explore the problem, an innovative procedure to estimate prey abundance, ecology and human behaviour, involving the estimation of the ecosystem carrying capacity, will be developed. This multidisciplinary and novel approach will provide, for the first time, accurate answers to questions concerning a) which particular subsistence patterns (if any) favoured AMH over Neanderthals while coping with the changing environment and b) the extent to which climatic oscillations affected Neanderthal extinction. In this, it will be of relevance to the study of Prehistory on a pan-European scale.",
