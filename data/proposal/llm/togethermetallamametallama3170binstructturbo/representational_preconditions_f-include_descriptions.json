        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to investigate the fundamental cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the human social mind, with a focus on the capacity to understand other minds. Challenging traditional theories, our novel approach posits that mental state monitoring and representation are primarily automatic and effortless processes, rooted in cooperative social interactions. Recent evidence from infancy research and our own findings suggest that infants as young as 7 months can compute others' beliefs automatically, even when not required to do so. This project will delve deeper into the functional components and triggering conditions of this ability in young infants, as well as its developmental trajectory. Furthermore, we will explore the implications of our theoretical proposal, which posits that this dedicated system is specialized for collaborative and communicative interactions. By shedding new light on the early representational preconditions and functional structure of theory-of-mind mechanisms, this research aims to contribute to a paradigm shift in the field, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the human social mind."

We aim to explore and shed new theoretical light on the basic cognitive and brain mechanisms of the human social mind. One of these mechanisms that has received much attention by earlier approaches to ‘theory-of-mind’ research concerns the ability to infer and represent the mental states of others. Standard theories and research in the last twenty five years have suggested that representing other’s beliefs is an effortful and late developing capacity (Wellman et al., 2001) whose main function is to explain others’ behavior. Here we advance and propose to explore a new theoretical perspective according to which the mechanisms of mental state monitoring and representation involve primarily automatic and effortless processes grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Our approach is part of an on-going paradigm change in the field of theory-of-mind research motivated by the recent evidence showing that infants in their second year understand mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). Our own research has gone a significant step further by demonstrating that these mechanisms are present as early as 7 month of age, and by showing that both young infants and adults seem to automatically compute others’ beliefs even in situations where they are not required to do so (Kovács et al, in press Science). The present project explores the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants’ powerful belief computation abilities and to chart their developmental unfolding. Furthermore, we shall explore the implications of the new theoretical proposal that this dedicated system presupposes as its proper domain the on-going collaborative and communicative interactions.",
