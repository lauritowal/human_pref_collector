        "**Abstract:**\n\nDespite widespread adoption of social computing features in various online domains, the impact of user engagement on websites and their users remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning from both business and societal perspectives, as the value of user engagement and its potential influence on user behavior are unclear. This project seeks to address these gaps through a comprehensive investigation of user engagement, focusing on the effects of calls to action that prompt participatory actions. A mixed-methods approach combining lab experiments with a custom-built website and large-scale field experiments in collaboration with diverse websites will be employed. Preliminary findings indicate significant effects of calls to action on user behavior and information sharing. The proposed research aims to fully elucidate these effects across multiple product domains and uncover their underlying mechanisms, ultimately shedding light on the economic and societal implications of the social computing phenomenon. The expected outcomes will significantly enhance our understanding of user engagement and inform the development of more effective and user-centric online platforms."

Accordingly, websites in numerous domains invest heavily in ‘social computing’ features that encourage such engagement. In fact, many attempt to elicit engagement proactively, through the use of calls to action—prompts that ask users to carry out participatory actions such as rating or ‘liking’ content. Given the vast popularity of social computing, it is surprising how little we actually know about how user engagement affects websites and their users. From a business perspective, the direct value of user engagement is far from clear. From a societal perspective, it is unclear whether the increasing expectation for users to engage with firms may lead users to behave in ways that do not serve them. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of user engagement, and specifically, engagement elicited by calls to action, from those two perspectives. I will use an empirical approach, relying on innovative lab and large-scale field experiments. The lab experiments leverage a specially-designed website. For the field experiments, we will collaborate with websites spanning several domains; we have already initiated a relationship with a leading website-development service provider that uses a freemium business model, and have been able to observe the actual behavior of its users. Our preliminary results are promising, supporting the idea that calls to action have strong effects on conversion and information revelation. Moving forward, I plan to fully characterize the nature of these effects in multiple product domains, and to isolate their underlying mechanisms. I am confident that this research program will transform our understanding of the economic and broader societal impact of the social computing phenomenon.",
