        "**Title: Breaking Down Barriers in Understanding Human Vision**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nHuman vision is a complex process that incorporates dynamic sampling, extraction, and integration of semantic information from our environment. However, traditional approaches to studying and modeling vision often focus on bottom-up categorization, neglecting the intricate relationships between visual processing, active information sampling, and semantic understanding. Our proposed project seeks to revolutionize the field by introducing an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that mimics natural visual exploration. We will employ cutting-edge non-invasive brain imaging techniques, novel multivariate analysis methods, and bio-inspired deep learning frameworks to study vision as a dynamic, semantic understanding-driven process. By analyzing brain activity while participants explore thousands of rich natural scenes, our project will provide unprecedented insights into the neural processes underlying visual semantic understanding. This groundbreaking research has the potential to fundamentally shift our understanding of vision, bridging the gap between biological and synthetic vision, and offering new perspectives on the intricate mechanisms that govern human visual perception."

To tap into this resource, the brain?s visual system engages in complex, intertwined computations to actively sample, extract, and integrate information across space and time. Surprisingly however, the integrative nature of vision hardly plays a role in the way we approach it in experimentation and computational modelling. Instead, higher-level vision is commonly treated as a largely bottom-up categorization process. TIME proposes a new approach. It will allow us to study vision in a more natural setting and as a process that is (a) geared towards semantic understanding instead of label-based categorisation, (b) naturally intertwined with active information sampling and (c) expanding across multiple timeframes, including network dynamics that unfold within and across eye fixations. This will be accomplished by an ambitious, three-step work program that combines cutting-edge non-invasive human brain imaging performed while participants visually explore tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, the development of novel multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modelling using a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision that closes the sensory-motor loop. Using this interdisciplinary approach, TIME will establish, for the first time, when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain as it actively samples and integrates information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. These ground-breaking developments both in experimentation and deep neural network modelling build towards a fundamental paradigm shift in how we study, model, and understand vision, yielding new insights into its complex neural processes operating in more natural, ecologically valid conditions, as well as a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision.",
