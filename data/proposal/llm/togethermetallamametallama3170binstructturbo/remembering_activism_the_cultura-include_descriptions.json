        "**Title: Unpacking the Legacy of Collective Action: A Comparative Study of Activism's Cultural Memory**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe reverberations of mass demonstrations and social movements extend far beyond their immediate aftermath. Yet, our understanding of how these events are remembered, retold, and referenced remains fragmented. This project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by providing the first comprehensive analysis of activism's cultural memory in Europe since the late 19th century. Through a comparative study of three pivotal periods of heightened activism (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012), we will investigate the complex dynamics of remembering and forgetting, and how the memory of protest is mediated, transmitted, and reinterpreted across generations. Our research will employ innovative network visualization techniques to map the reproduction of narratives and references to predecessors, shedding new light on the ways in which collective action shapes civic identity and informs subsequent movements. By developing a nuanced framework for analyzing the cultural transmission of hope and resistance, this project aims to challenge dominant trauma-based models of cultural memory and open up new avenues for social movement research. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of collective memory in fostering active citizenship and civic engagement."

But how are they remembered when they are no longer news? Social movements are usually studied in terms of their emergence and subsidence. Despite recognition that activists are ‘inspired’ by precedents, the afterlife of activism in story and image has never been systematically explored. ReAct contends that knowledge about this cultural memory is needed for a full understanding civil resistance. ReAct will provide the first in-depth account of the remembering and forgetting of activism in Europe since the late 19th century. It will reveal continuities and changes in how protest has been depicted in different media regimes; demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying the memory of protest to later generations; and show how this memory feeds back into later movements at home and abroad. The project is designed around case studies from periods of heightened activism in Europe: 1871-1914; 1960-1970; 2011-2012. Work packages follow 3 intersecting lines of inquiry: mediation (what cultural frames have been used to turn activism into transferable knowledge?); afterlives (how has the memory of particular movements been culturally transmitted?); memoryscapes (how have later movements referenced earlier ones?). A key innovation is network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references to predecessors. ReAct will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research: by developing analytic tools with which to capture the cultural transmission of hope, it provides an alternative to the trauma-based models that currently dominate the field. It will also open up a new area of social movement research by revealing traditions of civic memory and how it is culturally produced. Outside of the academy, ReAct will provide critical literacies with which to rethink collective memory and identity in terms of active citizenship rather than ethnic-national grievances.",
