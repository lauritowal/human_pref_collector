        "**Abstract:**\n\nFamines continue to devastate communities worldwide, with alarming frequency and severity. Despite a long-standing scholarly consensus that famine is primarily the result of human agency rather than natural disasters, a culture of accountability and concerted action to prevent famine has yet to emerge. This research seeks to challenge the existing paradigm in famine politics by shifting the focus from national and international institutions to the everyday politics of famine at the community level. Through an ethnographically-informed comparative study across four sites in South Sudan and Somalia, this project will investigate how discourses and power dynamics shape the social perception of famine, normalize its occurrence, and deflect blame from responsible actors. By examining four key areas – collective memories of past famines, community narratives and social networks, death and burial practices, and the role of media in anti-famine politics – this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex politics of famine and shed light on the mechanisms that perpetuate this humanitarian crisis. Leveraging the researcher's established networks and a diverse team of Somali and South Sudanese researchers, this project seeks to contribute a groundbreaking new perspective to the field of famine studies and inform evidence-based policies to prevent famines."

For decades there has been a scholarly consensus that famine is the result of political failure or design, and never solely the result of natural disasters. However, a political culture that makes famine politically unconscionable and that ends famine has not emerged. To understand why famines persist we need to deepen our understanding of famine politics; so far scholarship on the politics of famine has focus on national and international institutions, and the instrumental use of famine by actors and institutions. My research will produce a ground-breaking shift in the science of famine politics by focusing on the everyday politics of famine in communities where it occurs. I am interested in how discourses and the ‘regime of truth’ about famine disperse throughout the social body (in Foucault’s words). In particular, I am interested in how new deadly famines come to be normalised, preventing political rupture. Plus, I am interested in how these discourses can shift blame for famine suffering away from governments, warring parties and actors in global economies, and instead place blame on natural causes and the families of those who suffer and die. To achieve this, I will conduct an ethnographically-informed comparative study across four sites in South Sudan and in Somalia. Initial ethnographic insights have made me structure the research around four cross-case-study research strands: histories and musical memories of past famine; community-narratives that enforce social networks; burial and posthumous practices; and media and social media’s role in anti-famine politics. This ambitious project is feasible because of my previous experience and networks, and because I have carefully built the capacity and track record of a team Somali and South Sudanese – dominated research team.",
