        "**Title: Reassessing the Foundations of International Trade in a Heterogeneous Firm Environment**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nAs the world grapples with resurgent protectionism and nationalistic sentiments, a pressing need emerges to reevaluate the fundamental principles governing international trade. This research project seeks to challenge traditional trade models, which assume homogeneous firms, by exploring the pivotal role of firm heterogeneity in shaping global trade patterns and welfare outcomes. Through four interconnected work packages, this study aims to provide novel insights into how firm diversity affects allocative efficiency, optimal trade policy design, comparative advantages, and export capabilities. By investigating the interactions between firm characteristics, sectoral responses, and country-specific factors, this project will shed new light on the complexities of international trade, informing policymakers and contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the global economy. Ultimately, this research endeavors to provide a more comprehensive framework for analyzing the intricacies of international trade, helping to address pressing questions about the efficacy of government intervention and the impact of globalization on societies worldwide."

Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? Should governments intervene to promote or restrict international transactions? Questions like these have recently gained new salience, in Europe and elsewhere, due to renewed protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies arising from diffuse disenchantment with globalization. The aim of the research project is to highlighting key dimensions along which the answers to these questions obtained from conventional trade models with homogenous firms should be revisited in the light of permanent pervasive firm heterogeneity. In particular, the project will pursue four specific objectives through four integrated work packages providing new insights on how firm heterogeneity affects: (1) the ability of markets to deliver allocative efficiency; (2) The design of optimal multilateral trade policies; (3) The comparative advantages of countries; (4) The capabilities of a country as an exporter. The first work package will investigate whether the allocative inefficiency (“misallocation”) determined by firm heterogeneity in the presence of pricing distortions is quantitatively relevant for a country’s aggregate economic performance, and whether economic integration reduces or exacerbates such misallocation. The second work package will develop the theoretical implications of firm heterogeneity for trade policy, with special emphasis on the cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements aimed at maximizing the joint welfare of all trade partners. The third work package will study how country, sector and firm characteristics interact to determine countries’ responses to trade liberalization. The fourth work package will investigate the distinct role of firm heterogeneity in determining a country’s ability to export through the shape of the productivity distribution of its producers.",
