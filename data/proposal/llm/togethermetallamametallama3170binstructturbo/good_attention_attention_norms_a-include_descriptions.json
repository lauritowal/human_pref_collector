        "**Title:** Grounding a Unified Framework for Attention Norms\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to address a pressing concern in contemporary discourse: the nature and regulation of attention in the face of distraction. By bridging the gap between philosophical inquiry and interdisciplinary research, we aim to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating attention norms. Our investigation will integrate insights from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, and ethics to develop a novel conceptual foundation based on priority structures that govern the mind. We hypothesize that relevance is a fundamental norm of attention, and will explore its biological function, social relevance, and role in decision-making, epistemology, and ethics. Our project will provide a unified foundation for attention norms, impact various philosophical fields, and inform policy-making by offering an analytical framework for the epistemic and ethical implications of attention. By shedding light on the complex relationships between attention, relevance, and human behavior, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the norms that govern our attention and inform our actions."

Much public discussion about social media, public health, and political debates is focused on versions of this question. What deserves our attention and how we should regulate attention in the face of distraction occupies the debate. What is missing is a philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for thinking about them. This is what GOODATTENTION provides. While entire fields of philosophy investigate the normative assessment of other aspects of the mind, the normative structure of attention remains largely unstudied. In its ground-breaking and interdisciplinary approach GOODATTENTION connects the study of the nature and the causal role of attention in psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics with the philosophical fields of decision theory, epistemology, and ethics. It develops a unified foundation for the study of attention norms by using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind. It aims, first, to understand how attention norms emerge within our individual psychology and in the social domain. And it aims, second, to evaluate attention norms by integrating them into normative philosophy. The project's hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. GOODATTENTION investigates the biological function of relevance processing and the role of social relevance for how attention is guided by social norms. Building on this investigation, GOODATTENTION considers the role of attention norms for relevance in decision making, and in epistemic and ethical considerations. GOODATTENTION will impact these philosophical fields by showing how they can integrate norms of attention. It unifies research in evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Its investigation of the epistemic role of attention and ethical rights and duties regarding attention will provide an analytical framework as input for policy making.",
