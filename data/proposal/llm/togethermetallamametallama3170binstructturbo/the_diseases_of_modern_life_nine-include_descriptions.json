        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project delves into the historical context of stress, information overload, and related disorders in the 19th century. By examining the intersection of literature, science, and medicine during this period, it aims to uncover the ways in which societal pressures and technological advancements contributed to the emergence of various health issues. Drawing inspiration from Benjamin Ward Richardson's \"Diseases of Modern Life\" (1876), this study will investigate the interconnections between physical, mental, and social well-being, as well as the holistic approaches employed by Victorian thinkers to understand the complexities of human health.\n\nThe project will focus on a range of topics, including the health implications of financial speculation, occupational hazards, substance abuse, and the pressures of modern education. Additionally, it will explore the development of phobias and nervous disorders, as well as the imaginative representations of utopian and dystopian societies in relation to health and disease. By bridging the gaps between psychiatric, environmental, and literary history, this research seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the historical roots of modernity's challenges, ultimately offering new perspectives on the complex relationships between human health, society, and the environment in the 21st century."

The Victorians diagnosed similar problems in the nineteenth century. The medic James Crichton Browne spoke in 1860 of the ‘velocity of thought and action’ now required, and of the stresses imposed on the brain forced to process in a month more information ‘than was required of our grandfathers in the course of a lifetime’. This project will explore the phenomena of stress and overload, and other disorders associated in the nineteenth century with the problems of modernity, as expressed in the literature, science and medicine of the period, tracking the circulation of ideas across these diverse areas. Taking its framework from Diseases of Modern Life (1876) by the medical reformer, Benjamin Ward Richardson, it will explore ‘diseases from worry and mental strain’, as experienced in the professions, ‘lifestyle’ diseases such as the abuse of alcohol and narcotics, and also diseases from environmental pollution. This study will return to the holistic, integrative vision of the Victorians, as expressed in the science and in the great novels of the period, exploring the connections drawn between physiological, psychological and social health, or disease. Particular areas of focus will be: diseases of finance and speculation; diseases associated with particular professions; alcohol and drug addiction amidst the middle classes; travel for health; education and over-pressure in the classroom; the development of phobias and nervous disorders; and the imaginative construction of utopias and dystopias, in relation to health and disease. In its depth and range the project will take scholarship into radically new ground, breaking through the compartmentalization of psychiatric, environmental or literary history, and offering new ways of contextualising the problems of modernity facing us in the twenty-first century.",
