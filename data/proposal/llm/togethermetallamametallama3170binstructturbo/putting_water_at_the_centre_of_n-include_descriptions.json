        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nReframing Nuclear Energy History: A Hydraulic Approach\n\nThis project proposes a novel perspective on the history of nuclear energy by centering it on the role of water. Challenging the conventional understanding of nuclear energy as primarily a product of nuclear physics and radiochemistry, our research argues that nuclear technology is fundamentally a hydraulic innovation, rooted in centuries of global hydraulic engineering traditions. By examining the intersection of historical water management practices, risk conceptions, and cultural influences, we aim to shed new light on the complex social and professional dynamics that have shaped the nuclear industry.\n\nOur research will investigate how past experiences with water manipulation and risk assessment have been carried forward into the nuclear age, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Through six thematic work packages, we will analyze the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, nuclearized river basins in the Soviet Union, Japan, and Europe, and the ecological impact of nuclear activities on fragile ecosystems. By recontextualizing nuclear energy history within a hydraulic framework, we expect to provide a deeper understanding of the historical logic underlying nuclear accidents and disasters. Our findings will not only revise the field of nuclear energy history but also inform public debates about the future of nuclear energy in Europe and beyond."

Rather than interpreting nuclear energy history as a history of nuclear physics and radiochemistry, it analyses it as a history of water. The project develops the argument that nuclear energy is in essence a hydraulic form of technology, and that it as such builds on centuries and even millennia of earlier hydraulic engineering efforts worldwide – and, culturally speaking, on earlier “hydraulic civilizations”, from ancient Egypt to the modern Netherlands. I investigate how historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions from a deeper past were carried on into the nuclear age. These risk conceptions brought with them a complex set of social and professional practices that displayed considerable inertia and were difficult to change – sometimes paving the way for disaster. Against this background I hypothesize that a water-centred nuclear energy history enables us to resolve a number of the key riddles in nuclear energy history and to grasp the deeper historical logic behind various nuclear disasters and accidents worldwide. The project is structured along six work packages that problematize the centrality – and dilemma – of water in nuclear energy history from different thematic and geographical angles. These include in-depth studies of the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, of the Soviet Union’s nuclear waters, of the Rhine Valley as a transnational and heavily nuclearized river basin, of Japan’s atomic coastscapes and of the ecologically and politically fragile Baltic Sea region. The ultimate ambition is to significantly revise nuclear energy history as we know it – with implications not only for the history of technology as an academic field (and its relationship with environmental history), but also for the public debate about nuclear energy’s future in Europe and beyond.",
