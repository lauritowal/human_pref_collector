        "**Title:** Assessing the Evolution of Funding Frictions in Financial Markets\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nFunding frictions pose a significant risk to the stability of financial systems, as witnessed during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. These market tensions can lead to the default of healthy institutions and undermine the entire financial system. This project seeks to investigate the impact of funding frictions on financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. By analyzing the effects of post-crisis changes in financial markets, including increased deficits, regulatory reforms, and shifts in pension risk transfers, this research aims to provide a deeper understanding of funding frictions. Specifically, the project will examine the impact of these changes on funding costs and access to credit markets. The findings of this study are expected to inform policy makers about the potential consequences of regulatory changes and assist sovereigns in managing their debt levels. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of more effective policy responses to future financial crises and help institutions mitigate funding risk."

In extreme situations, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) or the market turmoil in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, funding frictions can lead to the default of otherwise healthy institutions and destabilize the entire financial system. While earlier research (pre-GFC) tends to disregard funding frictions, the enormous risk associated with these market tensions highlights that a deeper understanding of funding frictions is crucial - it can guide policy makers to determine their optimal responses to future crises and help institutions to reduce their funding risk. In this project, I will investigate how funding frictions affect financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. While funding frictions can, in the most extreme cases, lead to the bankruptcy of otherwise healthy entities, they usually first manifest through elevated costs for external financing, shorter debt maturities, or a lack of access to certain credit markets. Focusing on these aspects, I will investigate the following question: How did the market developments since the GFC affect funding frictions for countries, banks, pension funds, and insurance companies? More specifically, I examine four post-crisis changes in financial markets - (i) ballooning deficits in most developed economies, (ii) tighter regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, (iii) pension risk transfers with firms transferring their defined benefit (DB) pension plans to life insurance companies, and (iv) tighter bank regulation (as implemented in the Basel III capital accords) - and study their impact on funding costs and access to credit markets. The results can help sovereigns with managing their increasing debt levels and inform policy makers about the (potentially unintended) consequences of regulatory changes.",
