        "Title: \"Unveiling the Roots of Performing Arts Counterculture: A Historical and Network Analysis of the 1960s and 1970s in Italy\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking research project that delves into the uncharted territory of Italy's performing arts counterculture during the 1960s and 1970s. By exploring the intersections of philosophy, politics, and artistic innovation, our study aims to reconstruct the historical context of this pivotal period, characterized by a surge in collaborative performances and the emergence of artistic communities. Our objectives are fourfold: (1) to collect, contextualize, and analyze interdisciplinary performances that exemplify the era's artistic experimentation; (2) to apply the concept of \"commonality\" to the art world of the counterculture; (3) to highlight the significance of local and international artistic networks; and (4) to create a digital archive of Italian performances from this period. By integrating historical, philosophical, and sociological insights with Social Network Theory, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling knowledge and interpreting performing arts, as well as an innovative digital archive visualization platform. Ultimately, our project seeks to preserve and disseminate a valuable cultural heritage, providing a comprehensive understanding of the counterculture's enduring impact on the performing arts landscape."

The overall objectives of INCOMMON are i) to study, collect and contextualize those encounters between theatre, music, visual arts, cinema and video art that assumed the form of performances, especially those created as collaborations between artists; ii) to apply the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ to the art field of the counterculture; iii) to underline the significance of artistic communities in the local and international scene; iv) to create a digital archive of the performances of the Italian artists of the period. The project will connect historical, philosophical and artistic debates to those in other sciences, sociology and in particular Social Network Theory,in order to reveal significant structures of meanings in the artistic community and to reveal the peculiar characteristics of shared creative processes.The methodology that will be developed is meant 1) to produce new ways of modelling the knowledge and interpretation of performing arts and 2) to create an innovative form of digital archive visualization, where rich interfaces will sustain and improve the understanding of the context and relationships analysed. INCOMMON will produce a comprehensive approach, oriented toward collection, digitalization, restoration and dissemination of direct documentation and related materials of the Italian performing arts production of the great creative, political, existential wave of the counterculture, preserving and making accessible a patrimony that otherwise will continue to be lost to future generations.",
