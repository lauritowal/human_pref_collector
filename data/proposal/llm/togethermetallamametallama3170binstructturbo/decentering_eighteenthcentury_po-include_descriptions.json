        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nReevaluating the Origins of European Political Economy: A Discourse of Human Betterment\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of European political economy by shifting the focus from the development of modern economic models to its roots in Enlightenment discourse and the pursuit of human improvement. By exploring the 18th-century literature on growth, wealth, and welfare, this study delves into the practical concerns and policies that defined political economy for its contemporaries. Using the Swedish empire as a case study, and drawing comparisons with other European contexts, this research aims to reconstruct the meaning of political economy in the early modern period.\n\nThe project investigates the articulation of key concepts – wealth, growth, and welfare – across five primary sites of discursive production: universities, legislative bodies, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. By analyzing the activities and discussions within these institutions, this study hypothesizes that they were driven by a common goal of improving the organization of state and society, and ultimately, the living conditions of the people. This project offers a well-grounded reassessment of the rise of economic argument in 18th-century Europe, providing a nuanced understanding of the role of political economy in shaping the modern world."

Historians of political economy have traditionally concentrated on the genesis of modern economics, tracing the emergence of economic models, methods and ideas that are today recognized as 'economics' through 'classical political economy', neo-classicism and on to the present. This new departure treats political economy as a discourse oriented to the improvement of conditions for human life and, as such, one of the Enlightenment’s key contributions to Western thought. However, any direct association of Enlightenment discourse with political economy requires qualification. Therefore, this project explores a very extensive contemporary literature about growth, wealth and welfare that has not fitted easily into the conventional retrospective history. Instead of converting past arguments into modern arguments about methods and models, the project investigates eighteenth-century political economy in terms of practical concerns, as measures and policies for betterment and improvement. Only in this way we can reconstruct what political economy meant to its contemporaries in the early modern period. The Swedish empire – considered by contemporaries as the stronghold of 'oeconomia' – functions as the primary case study, but is constantly compared with other cases, broadening the applicability of the findings. The aim of the project is to study the ways in which the key concepts of improvement – wealth, growth and welfare – were articulated in the main sites of discursive production: the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The study of the five institutions is based on the hypothesis that in each of them activities were directed towards improving the organisation of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project represents a well-founded reassessment of the rise to predominance of economic argument during the eighteenth century.",
