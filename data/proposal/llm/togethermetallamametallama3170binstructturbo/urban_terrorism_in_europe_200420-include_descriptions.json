        "Title: Rethinking Urban Resilience: A Comparative Study of Memory, Security, and Creativity in the Face of Terrorism\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the complex interplay between memory, security, and creativity in European cities that have experienced major terrorist attacks. Focusing on Spain, the UK, France, and Germany, our research will provide a nuanced understanding of how urban spaces have been transformed in response to these traumatic events. By drawing on interdisciplinary approaches from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, we will analyze the collective forms of remembering, forgetting, and imagining that have shaped urban landscapes in these countries. \n\nOur study will critically examine the material security infrastructures and policies implemented in response to terrorist attacks, and explore alternative forms of remembering and envisioning the future through performance art. The project's outputs will include a comprehensive website, academic publications, and a series of public performances that will stimulate critical debates about securitization processes in Europe. By rethinking urban resilience and challenging dominant narratives on terrorism, this project aims to contribute to a more inclusive and creative approach to urban security and memory-making."

Whilst trying to come to terms with recent acts of urban terrorism, governments, security agencies, and local communities are bracing themselves for further attacks. UrbTerr will offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in four European countries that have suffered particularly as a result of this wave of violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Drawing on concepts and methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory and anthropology, UrbTerr will document and analyse a range of voices in contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe and problematise the narrow concept of imagination and creativity underpinning recent counter-terrorism measures and a great part of the academic literature on this subject. It will: (1) analyse the collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining that have shaped urban spaces in the four countries after recent terrorist attacks; (2) develop a new materialist approach to terrorism and use this framework to critically assess policies and material security infrastructures that were created in response to these attacks at a local and European level; (3) use performance art as a creative tool to develop and experiment with alternative forms of remembering and different visions of the future. Outputs of the project will include a website with footage of interviews with city residents, politicians, architects, political activists, and other key actors, as well as other resources for terrorism research, two academic monographs, articles in peer-reviewed journals, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of thought-provoking public performances by the art group ‘Center for Political Beauty’ that will spark critical debates about securitization processes in contemporary Europe.",
