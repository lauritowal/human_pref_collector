        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe HOMME project aims to investigate the impact of evolving family and working life dynamics on men’s health and cognitive outcomes. Despite men’s higher risk of premature mortality and preventable health issues, there is a significant gap in research exploring the consequences of recent socio-economic shifts on men’s well-being. HOMME will leverage comprehensive Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data to analyze the relationship between men’s changing roles and their health and cognitive functions across different life stages. The project focuses on young adulthood and midlife, critical periods marked by significant family transitions and work experiences. By examining cohort and period differences, the work-life interface, the traditional male breadwinner model, and the increasing involvement of fathers in childcare, HOMME seeks to disentangle the complex interactions between social roles and health outcomes. The study will also address the challenges posed by technological change, rising male childlessness, and shifts in labor market participation. With a dataset encompassing over 12,000 men aged 18 to 69, HOMME will provide valuable insights into the factors that influence men’s health and cognition, ultimately contributing to more effective policies and interventions aimed at improving men’s well-being and promoting gender equality."

Improving men’s health and cognition is not only critical for achieving gender equality, but also for enhancing and extending men’s potential to contribute to their families, the labour market and society as populations grow older. HOMME studies how men’s (changing) family and working lives influence their health and cognition. Men’s family and working lives are changing: Men now lag behind women with regards to tertiary education; female labour participation has increased while male labour participation has slightly decreased. Men are more apt to lose their job due to technological change. Male childlessness has risen dramatically, much more than female childlessness; in many Western countries, one out of four or almost one out of three men are now childless at age 40. Fathers are participating more in childcare, and men have partially lost their role as family “breadwinners”. So far, insufficient research has examined the consequences of these changes on men’s health and cognition. HOMME capitalizes on the richness of Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data to examine how men’s (rapidly changing) family and working lives are related to their health and cognition across adulthood, as well as across cohorts, periods and between communities. We focus on young adulthood and midlife – the life period most characterized by family transitions and work experiences. We examine cohort and period differences, men’s work-face interface, the male breadwinner model and fathers’ participation in childcare, and disentangle selection and causality. Our data covers genes; parents, (former) spouses and partners; self-reported, clinical, and register measures of health; register data on work participation and occupation; and cognitive trajectories of N=12,000+ men between the late teens to ages 36 to 69 (and potentially beyond, pending funding of the project).",
