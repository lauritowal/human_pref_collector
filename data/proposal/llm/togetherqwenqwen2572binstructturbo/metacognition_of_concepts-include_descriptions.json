        "This research project, Metacognitive Concepts (MetCogCon), aims to explore the metacognitive processes that accompany the use of concepts in human cognition. Concepts are fundamental to human thought, serving as the foundational elements that enable reasoning, induction, and decision-making. However, the reliability and suitability of these concepts for specific cognitive tasks vary, and individuals possess an intuitive sense of this dependability. This sense is critical in determining whether to adopt or reject certain concepts, both in everyday thinking and in more formal theoretical frameworks. Despite its importance, the metacognitive evaluation of concepts remains underexplored, lacking a robust theoretical framework. MetCogCon seeks to address this gap by conducting the first comprehensive investigation into the scope of metacognition as it pertains to concepts. By integrating philosophical analysis with cognitive science methodologies, including psychological modeling and empirical research, the project will develop a deeper understanding of how people evaluate their concepts. This work is expected to yield significant insights into cognitive control and concept reliability, potentially informing policies on reasoning practices in both everyday and specialized contexts. Ultimately, MetCogCon aims to enhance our understanding of a core aspect of human cognition, contributing to broader philosophical and scientific discourse."

Concepts lie at the heart of the extraordinary power of the human mind. They are the building blocks of thought, the tools with which we think. Like physical tools, they can be more or less dependable, more or less fit for purpose: e.g. for most people GENE feels like a better concept than MEME. We have an intuitive sense of how dependable a concept is, which is crucial when we decide whether to rely on the concept. It can underpin our decision to reject some concepts (e.g. RACE) and embrace others in our theorising (e.g SPECIES). Similarly in everyday thinking: when concepts are selected for reasoning and induction, and when different cognitive processes compete for control of action, the metacognition that accompanies the concepts involved will have a powerful effect. However, metacognition directed at concepts is still poorly understood. We lack even a clear theoretical framework to underpin research in this area. That is unfortunate because developing an account of peopleâ€™s metacognitive understanding of their concepts is likely to tell us important things about concepts and about cognitive control; and to solve some thorny philosophical problems. MetCogCon takes up that opportunity. The project will be the first systematic investigation of the scope of metacognition as it applies to concepts. We propose to combine the analytic methods developed by philosophers of mind and cognitive science with psychological model-building and experimental investigation. The insights gained in the project could have important implications for policies about how to reason in everyday and in scientific/philosophical contexts, by outlining when the cues and heuristics that underpin our decisions to embrace or reject particular concepts can and cannot be trusted. Most significantly, the project promises to increase our understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind.",
