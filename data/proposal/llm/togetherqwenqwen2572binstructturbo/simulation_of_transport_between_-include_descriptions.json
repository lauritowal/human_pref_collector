        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe STRADA project aims to develop a dynamic, computer-based simulation system to explore Roman inland transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube, integrating advanced technological methods with experimental data and historical research. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to enhance our understanding of the economic cohesion and sustainability of the Roman Empire by examining the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier. The project will analyze the impact of environmental factors on transport systems and introduce dynamic simulations into historical research. Key components include the precise reconstruction of ancient land and water routes, the experimental assessment of transport performance under varying conditions, and the creation of a time-sensitive simulation system that incorporates detailed topography, historical weather data, and the logistics of different transport methods. STRADA's modular design ensures its sustainability and adaptability, making it a valuable tool for future research in other regions and periods. By covering a diverse range of landscapes from Mediterranean lowlands to alpine and central European river regions, STRADA will provide a comprehensive and nuanced view of Roman transport and its broader implications."

Therefore, it is an absolute desideratum to explore Roman inland transport transdisciplinary, combining recent technological developments with experimental data and profound historical research to gain the most realistic transport times. The objective of STRADA is the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system for water and land borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube. Thereby, STRADA is geared to three aims: a) the study of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, for gaining a better understanding of the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire, b) the analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system, c) and the introduction of dynamic simulations into historical research. For the implementation, the project will focus on three closely interwoven strands: The exact reconstruction of the ancient land- and water-routes, the experimental determination of the performance of the used land- and water-borne means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and the development of a time-related simulation system including local fine granular topography and historical weather data, different means of transport (water- and land-based) with different loads, the fatigue of the actors as well as necessary rests and loading times. STRADA will follow a modular design that will ease the sustainable use and a future extension of the simulation system. The chosen research area covers a wide range of landscapes from the Mediterranean lowlands, followed by different kinds of alpine regions, to a central European river landscape, which makes it easy adaptÂ¬able to other times and places.",
