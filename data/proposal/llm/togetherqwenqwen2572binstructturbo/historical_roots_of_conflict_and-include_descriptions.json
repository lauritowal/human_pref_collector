        "This research proposal seeks to explore the intricate relationship between historical institutions, human capital, and economic development in Latin America, as well as the long-term impact of ancient conflicts on contemporary conflict patterns. The core of the project involves a detailed analysis of administrative data from the first colonizers of Latin America, spanning from 1492 to 1599. This dataset includes personal characteristics of settlers such as their town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and city of arrival in the Americas. By employing a within-country analysis and leveraging the varying institutional environments present during the early colonial period, the study aims to reevaluate the debate on whether institutions or human capital are the primary drivers of economic development and conflict. The research will also examine the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial phases of colonization, providing insights into the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part of the project, the focus shifts to the long-term dynamics of conflict. By constructing a dataset of ancient conflict locations using archaeological evidence, the study will investigate how very old conflicts influence current conflict dynamics across regions. This comprehensive approach will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical roots of economic development and conflict in Latin America."

Following the lead of the new institutional economics, part of the literature argues that institutions cause differences in productivity and factor endowments which, in turn, explain economic development. An alternative view assumes that human capital shapes institutional changes and, therefore, institutions are endogenous. In the first part of the project, which is the core of the research proposal, I will try to move one step further in this debate by taking an approach that uses administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The data contain some personal characteristics on each of the settlers from 1492 to 1599 (town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, city of arrival in the Americas, etc). Using within-country analysis, since we have information on the precise destinations of the first “pobladores” (settlers), and the different institutional set-ups during the first years of colonization for different geographical areas in Latin America, I will reexamine the issue of institutions versus human capital in the explanation of economic development and conflict. The institutions in the initial times of colonization were not the same in all the regions of Latin America and, in many cases, represented an evolution of pre-Colombian institutions. The new data allows also the analysis of the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial times. In addition the migrations and the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization provide also some guidance for the research on the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part I plan to go further back in time to understand how very old conflicts influence current conflict. I will construct a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the dynamics of conflict by regions in the very long run.",
