        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe READ (Reconstructing Early Animal Domestication) project aims to elucidate the initial stages of sheep and goat domestication, a critical yet understudied aspect of Neolithic archaeological research. Traditional zooarchaeological methods, which focus on morphological changes in animal remains, are limited in their ability to detect early domestication events due to the long timescales over which these changes occur. The READ project proposes a novel approach by utilizing biogeochemical analyses of fossil teeth to reconstruct the life histories of these animals with unprecedented temporal resolution. This method will enable the identification of three key mechanisms that were instrumental in the early stages of domestication: the control of reproductive cycles, the alteration of feeding habits, and the disruption of migratory patterns. By analyzing faunal assemblages from the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and the Eastern Fertile Crescent—regions central to the domestication process—the project will generate a comprehensive dataset that includes both archaeological and modern reference samples. This interdisciplinary approach, combining established scientific techniques with innovative research questions, will provide new insights into the human practices that led to the domestication of caprines, challenging existing paradigms and offering a clearer understanding of where and when this transformative process began."

The earliest steps of this phenomenon are, still today, very difficult to achieve. Traditional zooarchaeological analyses used to date domestication rely on detecting the appearance of genetically-driven morphological changes in animals. These morphological markers, however, if they occur at all, only appear after the process is well underway, after hundreds, if not thousands, of years, making it difficult to study them. The READ project will build an alternative approach to detect early evidences of sheep and goat management. The project will investigate the historical life-traits of the animals with a high-resolution time analysis by performing biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth. Scientific approaches employed are not all highly innovative but their combination together with the themes addressed will involve a high-gain. This will allow reconstructing the three clue mechanisms that were pivotal in the lead up to domestication: the control of the animals’ reproductive cycles; the induced changes to their feeding habits; and the interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. The project will evaluate and compare data from what are known to be the three key regions for this research area: the Southern Levant, the Northern Levant and the Eastern Fertile Crescent. READ will analyses a set of the most important and significant available faunal assemblages for these regions and will put together a reference dataset from wild relatives available in museum collections and current living populations found in breeding centres. At the end of the project I will unravel the current unresolved paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates not relying on how the animals changed but rather what the human societies did to change the animals; revealing how early caprine management was done and where and when processes of animal domestication were initiated.",
