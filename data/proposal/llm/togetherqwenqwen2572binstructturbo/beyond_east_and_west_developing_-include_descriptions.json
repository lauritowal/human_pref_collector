        "This project aims to bridge the gap between Turkey’s rich musical heritage and contemporary Western concert music through a series of innovative research workshops and practical training sessions. By addressing the challenges posed by differences in tuning, texture, and performance practices, we seek to create a new, integrated strand of contemporary music and opera that seamlessly blends Eastern and Western traditions. The project will convene workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, where top-level traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers will be trained to perform a new repertoire, while Western professional singers will learn non-Western vocal techniques. Additionally, the project will develop methodologies for analyzing the adaptive processes of musicians and the audience's perception of this new musical fusion. To enhance the merging of sounds, we will design new instruments and an ensemble interface, and conduct groundbreaking studies on timbre and tuning systems. The outcomes of this research will be compiled into a comprehensive e-book, \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" published by Cambridge University Press, complete with audio and visual resources. Beyond its immediate musical goals, this project also serves as a model for transcending cultural barriers, offering insights into the potential of artistic collaboration to address global challenges."

But differences in tuning, texture, and between oral and notated orientations to performance have presented seemingly intractable obstacles. This project systematises practical processes essential for the creation of a new, East-West strand of contemporary music and opera. It initiates cutting-edge research workshops in Istanbul, Holland and the UK to: 1. Train top-level traditional instrumentalists and singers in Turkey effectively to perform a new repertoire; 2. Train top professional Western singers in non-Western techniques and nuances of vocal production; 3. Develop approaches for modelling such music's impacts on Turkish and Western musicians’ adaptive processes in rehearsal and performance, and diverse audiences’ perceptions of such music; 4. Create an ensemble interface (including newly designed instruments) to increase capacity for merging sounds beyond levels now achievable; 5. Produce groundbreaking studies on timbre to provide new insights into how sound is produced; 6. Establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems onto one another. This research, together with an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds will comprise the core of a published (CUP) team-authored e-book, Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), with included audio and visual examples linked as an online resource. Looking further, this project’s multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach also suggests a model for probing how the ‘free play’ of the imagination (Kant) possible within processes of art and its creation can provide metaphors towards understanding one of the most urgent and compelling issues of our time: how to transcend cultural barriers (real or imagined) that exist today.",
