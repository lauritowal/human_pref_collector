    "descriptions": [
        "The proliferation of disinformation poses a significant threat to democratic processes and social cohesion. As citizens increasingly depend on online information sources, algorithms play a crucial role in shaping the content users encounter, often reinforcing preexisting beliefs and creating echo chambers. While efforts to combat disinformation have focused on social media platforms, the role of search engines remains underexplored. The FARE_AUDIT project aims to bridge this gap by developing an innovative auditing tool designed to assess the impact of search algorithms on the dissemination of disinformation. This tool will enable researchers and organizations to:\n\n1. Investigate how browsing history influences search results, particularly the likelihood of encountering disinformation.\n2. Establish a real-time monitoring system for identifying new disinformation sources.\n3. Simulate diverse user profiles to break information bubbles and provide a broader perspective on search outcomes.\n\nUtilizing web-crawling technology, FARE_AUDIT ensures user privacy by avoiding the collection of personal data. The project also anticipates the transition from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting, leveraging the overlap period to enhance the tool’s effectiveness. By increasing public awareness and providing actionable insights, FARE_AUDIT seeks to empower democratic institutions and citizens to better navigate the complex landscape of online information."

Citizens increasingly rely on (dis)information available online, either somewhat passively, through social media feeds, or actively, by using search engines and specific websites. In both scenarios, algorithms filter and select displayed information according to the users’ past preferences. There is a real risk that algorithms might reinforce the user’s beliefs and create (dis)information bubbles, by offering less divergent views, or even directing them to low-credibility content. For these reasons, serious efforts have been made to identify and remove “fake-news” websites and minimize the spread of disinformation on social media, but we have not witnessed equivalent attempts to understand and curtail the role of search engines. FARE_AUDIT addresses this imbalance and offers an innovative tool to audit search engines that can be broadly used. It will help to 1) better understand how browsing history influences search engine results, particularly the likelihood of being directed to disinformation, 2) create a system that democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens can use to identify new disinformation, in near real-time, and 3) breach information bubbles by simulating how search results would be different if users had a different online profile. By relying on web-crawlers, our tool is privacy-protecting and does not require any real user data. Moreover, the proposed system anticipates the announced shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting and takes advantage of the expected small time overlap between both systems to learn from both and broaden its scope. Overall, we expect this novel tool to have a meaningful social impact by increasing public awareness of the role of search engines on disinformation spread, and by equipping organizations with a tool to detect and monitor disinformation, especially in political contexts.",
