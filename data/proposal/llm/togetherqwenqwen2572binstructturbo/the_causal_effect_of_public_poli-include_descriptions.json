        "This project seeks to address a critical gap in the literature on the \"fetal origins hypothesis\" by exploring the impact of early life shocks and interventions on child development during the \"missing middle\" years—specifically, from early infancy to adolescence. Despite substantial evidence that early shocks can significantly influence long-term human capital formation, such as adult health and wages, the intervening period remains understudied. Utilizing high-quality administrative data from Spain spanning the past 35 years, this research will leverage natural experiments to assess the causal effects of various public policies and shocks on child development. The study will focus on five distinct shocks occurring during early childhood, including: (i) changes in household material resources through an unconditional mother’s allowance, (ii) alterations in parental time due to subsidized paternity leave, (iii) medical treatments around birth, such as elective delivery, (iv) access to family planning services, and (v) aggregate demand shocks affecting different sectors of the economy. By employing state-of-the-art econometric techniques, this project will evaluate the impact of these shocks on health and cognitive development at ages 0-15, using data from hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. Additionally, the study will investigate the underlying mechanisms linking these interventions to child outcomes, such as changes in family size, parental time use, labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. The findings will provide valuable insights into the most cost-effective strategies for improving children's future outcomes and inform policy decisions aimed at enhancing human capital development."

However, we still know little about the years in between early infancy and adulthood, referred to as the “missing middle”. How do early shocks affect health and human capital formation during childhood? How do the effects of different types of interventions, or shocks at different ages, compare? What are the most cost-effective ways of improving young children’s future outcomes? I aim to fill this gap in the literature by taking advantage of a range of natural experiments in a country, Spain, for which high quality administrative data are available for the past 35 years. State of the art econometric techniques, combined with large sample sizes, will allow me to evaluate credibly and precisely the causal effects of a number of different public policies and shocks on child development. I will consider five different “shocks” in early childhood (at different ages), affecting: i) Household material resources (an unconditional mother’s allowance); ii) Parental time (subsidized paternity leave); iii) Medical treatments around birth (elective delivery); iv) The availability of family planning services (access to abortion); and v) Aggregate demand shocks to different sectors of the economy. I will evaluate their impact on health and cognitive development at ages 0-15, as measured in hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores, among other data sources. I will also study the potential channels linking treatments to child outcomes, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, expenditure patterns, etc. My results will help us understand how shocks in early life can have long-term effects on human capital, with direct policy implications.",
