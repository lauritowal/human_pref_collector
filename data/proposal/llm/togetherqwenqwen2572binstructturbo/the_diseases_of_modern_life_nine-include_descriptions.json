        "This project seeks to investigate the historical parallels and divergences between the Victorian era's response to the challenges of modernity and the contemporary issues of information overload and stress. By examining the literature, science, and medical discourse of the 19th century, particularly through the lens of Benjamin Ward Richardson's \"Diseases of Modern Life\" (1876), the study aims to uncover how the Victorians conceptualized and addressed the mental and physical ailments attributed to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Key areas of focus include the impact of professional pressures, lifestyle-related disorders such as alcohol and drug addiction, and the effects of environmental pollution. The project will delve into the Victorian understanding of the interconnections between physical, mental, and social health, drawing from both medical treatises and literary works. It will also explore the cultural responses to these issues, including utopian and dystopian visions of health and disease. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this research will not only enrich our understanding of the Victorian period but also provide a historical framework for addressing the contemporary challenges of modern living."

The Victorians diagnosed similar problems in the nineteenth century. The medic James Crichton Browne spoke in 1860 of the ‘velocity of thought and action’ now required, and of the stresses imposed on the brain forced to process in a month more information ‘than was required of our grandfathers in the course of a lifetime’. This project will explore the phenomena of stress and overload, and other disorders associated in the nineteenth century with the problems of modernity, as expressed in the literature, science and medicine of the period, tracking the circulation of ideas across these diverse areas. Taking its framework from Diseases of Modern Life (1876) by the medical reformer, Benjamin Ward Richardson, it will explore ‘diseases from worry and mental strain’, as experienced in the professions, ‘lifestyle’ diseases such as the abuse of alcohol and narcotics, and also diseases from environmental pollution. This study will return to the holistic, integrative vision of the Victorians, as expressed in the science and in the great novels of the period, exploring the connections drawn between physiological, psychological and social health, or disease. Particular areas of focus will be: diseases of finance and speculation; diseases associated with particular professions; alcohol and drug addiction amidst the middle classes; travel for health; education and over-pressure in the classroom; the development of phobias and nervous disorders; and the imaginative construction of utopias and dystopias, in relation to health and disease. In its depth and range the project will take scholarship into radically new ground, breaking through the compartmentalization of psychiatric, environmental or literary history, and offering new ways of contextualising the problems of modernity facing us in the twenty-first century.",
