        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe POSTNORM project seeks to explore the underlying mechanisms that shape political competition in new democracies, particularly focusing on the rejection of the ideological legacies of past authoritarian regimes. This project posits that the ideological associations from the authoritarian era create a lasting bias in the political landscape, influencing both voter preferences and party strategies. Through innovative survey experiments, POSTNORM will investigate how these biases manifest in the avoidance of certain political ideologies, leading to the decline of left-wing parties in Poland and the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal. The project will also examine how these biases affect national identity, political discourse, and the formation of new political parties. By developing a comprehensive theory, POSTNORM aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies, contributing to broader theories of democratic transition and political behavior."

Why has Portugal been one of the last countries in Western Europe to see a radical right party in the national parliament? Why are right-wing individuals more likely to protest in Eastern Europe than left-wing individuals (Kostelka and Rovny 2019)? POSTNORM proposes a theory postulating that these seemingly unrelated patterns are the product of a single process: the rejection of the ideological brand of the past authoritarian regime. Through novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will examine how in new democracies, the ideological associations with the old regime serve as a focal point for norms that govern what are appropriate political positions for voters and parties: in democracies following left(right-)wing dictatorship, voters and political elites avoid associating themselves with the left(right) respectively. POSTNORM further derives a set of testable expectations about how this bias shapes both the demand- and the supply side of party competition. The bias colors citizens’ ideological preferences; perceptions about parties’ stances in these issues; national identity; political discussions; the supply of new parties; post-transition party names and pro-grammatic stances; and party elite discourse. POSTNORM will deliver a parsimonious new theory that will help make sense of heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies",
