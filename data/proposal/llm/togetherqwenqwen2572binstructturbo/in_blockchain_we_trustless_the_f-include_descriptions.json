        "**Abstract:**\n\nBlockchain technology, often heralded as a \"trustless\" solution, has the potential to redefine governance and power structures by eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. The BlockchainGov project aims to explore the transformative impact of blockchain on governance, both in terms of its ability to decentralize power and its implications for trust and legitimacy. This interdisciplinary endeavor will first examine the internal governance mechanisms of existing blockchain systems, analyzing the power dynamics within these frameworks. Secondly, it will assess the legitimacy and sustainability of current distributed governance models through the perspectives of legal and political theory. Thirdly, the project will investigate how blockchain can facilitate new, decentralized models of governance that enhance transparency and accountability. Finally, it will conduct practical experiments with these models across various governance levels, from local communities to global platforms. By integrating insights from computer science, political science, and law, BlockchainGov seeks to establish a new academic field dedicated to \"distributed governance.\" This project promises to deliver significant empirical and theoretical contributions, with far-reaching implications for the future of global governance. To achieve these ambitious goals, the project requires a funding scheme that supports a dedicated, multidisciplinary team capable of tackling high-risk, high-gain research."

Often described as a “trustless” technology, blockchain’s potential for disintermediation has been touted as a catalyst of innovation that could displace existing power structures. But is it shifting power away from former centers of power only to create new ones, or can it lead to an actual new organisation of power? BlockchainGov is an interdisciplinary project that will study the impact of blockchain technology on new and existing governance structures, and its consequences for legitimacy and trust. First, it will investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, and analyse the power dynamics at play within these systems. Second, it will examine the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of existing attempts at distributed governance, through the lenses of legal and political theory. Third, it will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new models of distributed governance providing an architecture for decentralized and participatory decision-making with attributes of transparency and accountability. Last, it will experiment with these new models at different levels of governance, from the community level to the global governance level. The project will open a new field of scholarship on “distributed governance” that uniquely combines the disciplines of computer science, political science and law. It will provide key empirical and theoretical contributions to science, with important policy implications to the broader questions of global governance. Bringing this project to life requires a funding scheme compatible with a high-risk/high-gain vision to finance a fully dedicated and highly motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills.",
