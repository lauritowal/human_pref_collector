        "China’s rapid urbanization presents significant theoretical and policy challenges, necessitating a reevaluation of its urban governance models. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and multi-scalar analysis of China’s urban governance, focusing on the interactions between state and society at the neighborhood, city, and regional levels. At the neighborhood level, the project will explore the dynamics between state policies and social practices, particularly in the context of migrant integration and homeowner self-governance. For cities, it will examine the strategies and governance mechanisms that drive migrant and ecological urbanism, along with the financial and land market instruments used to implement urban projects. At the regional level, the research will uncover the complex state-market relationships that influence the distribution of population and economic activities across cities, shaping the formation of city-regions. The study will be conducted through six case studies: Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. Utilizing ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and collaboration with Chinese researchers and policymakers, this project will offer a nuanced understanding of China’s urban transformation, considering indigenous perspectives and contributing to the development of entrepreneurial urban governance theories. The project will also organize six workshops within China to facilitate knowledge exchange and produce a series of publications, providing timely insights as China implements a UN-endorsed new urban agenda and navigates global trade tensions."

This ground-breaking project will rethink China’s model of urban governance through grounded and multi-scalar investigations ranging from neighbourhoods and cities to regions. For neighbourhoods, it unravels the interface between state and society in everyday living space, migrant social agencies and the self-governance of homeowners’ associations under urbanisation and housing marketization. For cities, it interrogates the development strategies and governance of migrant and ecological urbanism as well as the implementation of projects through financial instruments and the land market. For regions, it uncovers entangled state–market relations which redistribute population and economic activities across cities and produce the city-region. The research will be conducted through six cases: Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, based upon grounded ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews and close engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers across different types of neighbourhoods and cities of varying sizes in coastal, central and western regions, and recent national strategic projects. The project is timely for China to implement a UN-endorsed new urban agenda and rethink its model in the face of trade tensions. It will change how we think of China and its governance and be the first of its kind to explicitly consider indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation. This innovative and contextually sensitive research will contribute to entrepreneurial urban governance theories and will offer a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China, with six workshops organised within China as integral parts of knowledge production as well as a series of publication outputs.",
