    "title": "Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges",
    "descriptions": [
        "This project seeks to explore the innovative reception of Classical Antiquity within contemporary children's and young adult cultures across diverse global regions. By extending the scope beyond the conventional Western focus, the research aims to reveal how these ancient narratives are not only assimilated but also dynamically reinterpreted in response to regional and global challenges. The project will employ a comparative approach, examining the varied reception models of Classical Antiquity in Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, and, importantly, in regions less commonly associated with the Graeco-Roman tradition, such as Africa and Asia. This comprehensive analysis will leverage the pervasive influence of popular culture, including films, internet activities, and computer games, to uncover the social, political, and cultural transformations occurring in these regions. The interdisciplinary team of scholars will produce a detailed survey of classical references, in-depth case studies, and practical educational materials designed to facilitate the use of ancient myths in programs for disabled children, thereby promoting integration and cultural exchange. This research will significantly broaden the understanding of how Classical Antiquity is received and adapted in modern contexts, offering valuable insights into the formation of cultural identities and the transition into adulthood."

This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients’ identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children’s and young adults’ culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and – a bold but necessary step – in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity – through the reception filter – to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.",
