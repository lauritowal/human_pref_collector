        "Despite global efforts to close the gender pay gap (GPG), women continue to earn significantly less than men, with an average disparity of 20% worldwide (United Nations, 2022). Even in regions committed to eliminating this gap, such as Europe, women earn 13% less on average (Eurostat, 2022). Despite the implementation of collective bargaining as a strategic measure to raise wages in feminized sectors, the GPG persists. The WAGE project aims to explore the gendered dynamics of collective bargaining by examining its historical, current, and potential future impacts in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. This research will focus on two key sectors: the male-dominated metal industry and the female-dominated nursing field. Through a combination of historical analysis, ethnographic research, and sectoral data collection, WAGE seeks to achieve three main objectives: 1) Compare and integrate the histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the selected countries; 2) Analyze the daily practices in collective bargaining that influence wage increases in both sectors; and 3) Examine how actors in these sectors perceive and respond to wage norms and gendered wage differentials. By addressing the underexplored relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes, WAGE will provide new insights and practical strategies to advance gender equity in wages."

In countries explicitly committed to eliminating the gender pay gap (GPG), such as those in Europe, women still earn, on average, 13% less than men do (Eurostat, 2022). This is regardless of the fact that countries with persistent GPGs have deployed a strategic institutional measure to raise the wage floor of feminised work sectors and reduce the GPG – namely, collective bargaining. The overall aim of WAGE is to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining by investigating the past, the unruly present and the possible future of regulated collective bargaining processes in three key countries: Germany, Norway and Sweden. Moreover, the project’s research design will involve gathering data at the sectoral level of the metal sector and nursing and will use ethnographic research methods. To realise its overall aim, WAGE will accomplish the following three research objectives: 1. Compare and synthesise existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. 2. Uncover and analyse daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male dominated metal sector and the female dominated nursing sector. 3. Document and explain how actors embedded in the male dominated metal and the female dominated nursing sector relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. Given the dearth of scholarship on the relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes from an inter-sectoral angle, this study will be the first to systematically use qualitative methods to explore the economic frontier between sectoral gendered wage differentials and collective wage formation, thereby contributing to the effort to achieve gender equity in practice.",
