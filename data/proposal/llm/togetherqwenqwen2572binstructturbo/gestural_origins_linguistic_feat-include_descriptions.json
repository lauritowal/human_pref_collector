        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to deepen our understanding of the evolution of human language by exploring the communicative behaviors of great apes, our closest evolutionary relatives. While human language is characterized by its ability to convey complex meanings and its reliance on social learning and syntactic structure, similar features in ape communication remain underexplored. By examining gesture use across 17 ape groups and 9 human groups in a pan-African study, we aim to address three key objectives. First, we will investigate whether there is cultural variation in ape gesture, analyzing how species, environmental factors, and social interactions influence the acquisition and use of these gestures. Second, we will explore how apes combine signals to construct meaning, and how the timing, size, and speed of gestures impact their communicative function. Finally, we will compare the use and comprehension of gestures in both human adults and children with those of apes, providing a direct comparison that can shed light on the evolutionary roots of human language. Through a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach, this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the origins and evolution of language, a crucial aspect of human cognition and social interaction."

Other species’ communication contains rich information exchange; but humans do more than broadcast information. Language is used to communicate goals to partners, it goes beyond information: it has meaning. Only great ape gestures show similarly systematic meaningful communication; they are essential to understanding how human language evolved. Beyond meaning, two core features of human language are social learning and syntactic structure. These are universals, present across cultures. We all learn words and how to use them from others, leading to languages and dialects. We all use syntax; expressing different meanings by recombining words. In fact, these two features are common in animal communication: sperm whales learn songs from others; finches re-order notes into different songs. But, in a significant evolutionary puzzle, both appear absent in the communication of our closest relatives. The discovery of meanings in ape gesture resulted from studying ape communication under the challenging natural conditions that allow its full expression. A single study of a single group: it was the tip of the iceberg. Employing pan-African data across 17 ape and 9 human groups. I will tackle three major objectives. (1) Is there cultural variation in ape gesture? We will look at how species, physical environment, and social interaction affect how apes acquire and use gestures. (2) When apes combine signals, does it change their meaning? Moving beyond sequential structure we will look at how apes combine signals to construct meaning, and how the speed, size, and timing of gestures impacts meaning. (3) Human-ape gesture. We will investigate adults’ and children’s use and comprehension of gestures to compare them directly to other apes. Using new and established techniques across a dramatically wider sample I will address the fundamental question of how human language evolved.",
