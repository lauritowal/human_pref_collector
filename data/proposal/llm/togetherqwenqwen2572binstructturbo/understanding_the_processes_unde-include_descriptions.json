        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a novel statistical framework to address critical challenges in the social sciences, particularly in understanding the drivers of polarized beliefs. Constructs such as beliefs and values are often inferred from survey data, which can introduce measurement errors and underestimation of effects. Additionally, when analyzing data from multiple groups, such as different countries, the underlying processes can vary, leading to complex and often misleading group-specific regression slopes. Compounding these issues, measurement non-invariance across groups can further distort comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we propose a mixture multigroup structural equation modeling (MGM-SEM) framework. This approach will enable the identification of subsets of groups with similar underlying processes, while accounting for measurement non-invariance. By integrating flexible measurement models, the MGM-SEM framework will provide a robust method for comparing effects across constructs and groups. The ultimate goal is to enhance our understanding of what drives polarized beliefs and to implement these methods in freely available software, thereby advancing the field of social science research."

For example, do values affect climate change beliefs? Do perceived threats predict political beliefs? Do risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation determine vaccine hesitancy? Polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination are a societal threat and it is important to study what drives them. Large-scale survey data is gathered to do so. Using regression to answer the questions ignores that constructs are not directly observable, but measured by survey items containing measurement error (challenge 1). Not correcting for this causes the studied effects to be underestimated and conclusions to be misguided. When many groups are involved - such as many countries in the European Social Survey - the underlying processes likely differ across groups. For example, drivers of climate change beliefs may differ for countries experiencing extreme weather. Group-specific or multilevel analyses result in numerous group-specific regression slopes or random effects, making it hard to find which regression effects are different or similar for which groups (challenge 2). Across many groups, the constructs' measurement is often inequivalent or 'non-invariant', for example, due to translation (challenge 3). A measurement model indicates how items measure a construct and disregarding non-invariance in this model invalidates the comparison of effects among constructs (i.e., one may find differences that are actually due to non-invariance). By tackling challenges 1-3, the proposed mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework provides the tools to break new ground in understanding what drives constructs like polarized beliefs. A clustering finds subsets of groups with common processes. Flexible measurement models account for non-invariance so that the clustering focuses on the processes. I will implement the methods in freely available software.",
