        "This project aims to advance econometric methods for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity in economic models, a critical issue that significantly impacts the accuracy of economic predictions and policy recommendations. By leveraging the rich information contained in longitudinal (panel) data, we will develop robust inference methods that can better account for individual differences among economic agents. The project is structured into three main components. The first component focuses on improving statistical inference in nonlinear models, moving beyond the current emphasis on point estimation to develop tests that can more accurately capture the uncertainty inherent in economic data. The second component addresses the estimation of models for network data, a growing area of interest due to the increasing recognition of the importance of social and economic connections in shaping economic outcomes. By treating network data as a form of panel data, we aim to derive new theoretical results and practical methods for estimating these models. The third component explores the non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables, a crucial area where existing methods fall short. These models are fundamental in labor economics and industrial organization, and our methods will provide a more nuanced understanding of decision-making processes. Theoretical and simulation-based assessments will validate the performance of the proposed methods, and empirical applications to labor force participation and international trade will demonstrate their practical utility."

Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in economic modeling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. The aim of this project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three blocks. Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel data. The first block deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second block makes progress on the estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third block uses panel data to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and they will be applied to various empirical problems. Two examples of applications that we will study are the extensive margin of labor force participation and the determinants of the import and export behavior of firms and countries.",
