        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project GOODATTENTION seeks to address a critical gap in the philosophical understanding of attention norms, a topic of increasing relevance in today's fast-paced, distraction-rich environment. While extensive research exists on the normative aspects of other mental processes, the normative structure of attention remains underexplored. GOODATTENTION proposes an innovative, interdisciplinary framework that integrates insights from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, and ethics to develop a comprehensive theory of attention norms. By focusing on the concept of relevance, the project aims to elucidate how attention norms arise both individually and socially, and to evaluate these norms within a broader philosophical context. It will explore the biological and social functions of relevance in guiding attention and examine the implications of attention norms for decision-making, knowledge acquisition, and ethical behavior. GOODATTENTION's findings will not only advance theoretical knowledge but also have practical applications in policy-making, offering a robust analytical framework for addressing issues related to attention in public health, social media, and political discourse. By unifying diverse fields of research, GOODATTENTION will provide a foundational understanding of attention norms that can inform both academic inquiry and real-world solutions."

Much public discussion about social media, public health, and political debates is focused on versions of this question. What deserves our attention and how we should regulate attention in the face of distraction occupies the debate. What is missing is a philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for thinking about them. This is what GOODATTENTION provides. While entire fields of philosophy investigate the normative assessment of other aspects of the mind, the normative structure of attention remains largely unstudied. In its ground-breaking and interdisciplinary approach GOODATTENTION connects the study of the nature and the causal role of attention in psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics with the philosophical fields of decision theory, epistemology, and ethics. It develops a unified foundation for the study of attention norms by using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind. It aims, first, to understand how attention norms emerge within our individual psychology and in the social domain. And it aims, second, to evaluate attention norms by integrating them into normative philosophy. The project's hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. GOODATTENTION investigates the biological function of relevance processing and the role of social relevance for how attention is guided by social norms. Building on this investigation, GOODATTENTION considers the role of attention norms for relevance in decision making, and in epistemic and ethical considerations. GOODATTENTION will impact these philosophical fields by showing how they can integrate norms of attention. It unifies research in evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Its investigation of the epistemic role of attention and ethical rights and duties regarding attention will provide an analytical framework as input for policy making.",
