        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project LABFLEX aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization and technological advancement. With the rise of alternative work arrangements such as outsourcing, sub-contracting, and flexible scheduling, the nature of employment has fundamentally shifted. LABFLEX seeks to address critical questions regarding the drivers and outcomes of these changes. Specifically, the project investigates whether shifts in job contracts are driven by evolving worker preferences or technological advancements that enable more efficient task organization. It also examines the effects of labor market flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps, and whether workers are adequately compensated for increased risks and adverse work conditions. Additionally, LABFLEX will analyze how labor market institutions and policies influence flexibility. To achieve these objectives, LABFLEX will integrate register data with large-scale experimental evidence on workers' preferences for various work and pay arrangements, and a comprehensive corpus of job vacancies detailing job attributes. This unique data combination will provide a detailed understanding of both the supply and demand sides of the labor market, enabling a thorough analysis of the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. Through the use of experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX aims to generate new insights and evidence to inform policy and practice in this rapidly evolving field."

At the core of these major developments is the degree of flexibility in the labor market. Alternative work arrangements, e.g., outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs have become a common feature of labor markets across the globe. While most economists would argue that labor market flexibility facilitates reaping the benefits of globalization and technology growth, these developments can have far reaching consequences for the division of resources in society. Indeed, the recent decades have witnessed a sharp rise in wage inequality. LABFLEX is motivated by these developments and seeks to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. LABFLEX raises a series of questions: Do differences in job contracts reflect shifts in worker preferences, or do they mirror advances in technology that facilitate gains from organizing job tasks differently? What are the impacts of flexibility in job contracts on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers being compensated for the adverse work conditions or the higher income risks, or do changes in job contracts reflect changes in the sharing of rents between workers and firms? How do labor market institutions affect flexibility? And what is the role of labor market policies? To answer these questions, LABFLEX will for the first-time link register data to large-scale experimental evidence on workersâ€™ stated preferences for a wide array of work and pay arrangements, and an exhaustive full-text corpus of vacancies with information on job attributes. This will allow drawing a very detailed picture of both the supply and the demand side of the labor market, facilitating a study of flexibility in job contracts. Combining these data with experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility.",
