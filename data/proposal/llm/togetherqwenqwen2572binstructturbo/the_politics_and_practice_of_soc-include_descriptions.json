        "This five-year research project aims to explore the complex dynamics between increased social media access and its impact on peace-building and conflict perpetuation in conflict-affected regions, with a particular focus on Eastern Africa. As new technologies facilitate the expansion of Internet access to some of the world's most remote and under-resourced areas, this project seeks to address a critical but often overlooked question: How do these technological advances influence the balance between peace and violence? The study will be structured around three interconnected research questions: First, how are social media platforms transforming the transnational aspects of conflict and peace-building efforts? Second, how are governmental and non-governmental authorities utilizing or reacting to social media in ways that either exacerbate or mitigate violent conflict? Third, how are individual experiences of conflict, participation, and response being altered by social media? Through a comprehensive analysis of dangerous speech online, the movement of individuals into and out of conflict, the strategic use of the Internet by various actors, and the role of governance in leveraging social media, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted impacts of social media on conflict dynamics in Eastern Africa."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",
