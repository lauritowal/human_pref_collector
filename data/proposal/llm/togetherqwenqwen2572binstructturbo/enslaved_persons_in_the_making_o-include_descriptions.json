        "**Abstract:**\n\nSLaVEgents is a pioneering research initiative aimed at redefining the understanding of slave agency in the ancient world. This project seeks to uncover the multifaceted roles and identities of enslaved individuals, their community networks, and the significant impacts their actions had on the political, social, economic, and cultural dynamics of the time. By adopting a broad geographical and temporal scope, SLaVEgents will explore the histories of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE, encompassing regions from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic. The project will integrate a wide array of sources, including texts in Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, alongside relevant archaeological evidence, to provide a comprehensive and nuanced view of ancient slaveries.\n\nThe research team, comprising the Principal Investigator, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral fellows, and three PhD candidates, will develop a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves. This database will include original sources and English translations, serving as a crucial resource for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The Linked Open Data generated will significantly contribute to the field of Digital Humanities, enabling new forms of research and collaboration.\n\nThe project's outputs will include a monograph, two collective volumes, fifteen scholarly articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, an international conference, and a dedicated website. These outputs will collectively advance the historical narrative, placing enslaved individuals at the center of ancient history and offering a transformative perspective on the past."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",
