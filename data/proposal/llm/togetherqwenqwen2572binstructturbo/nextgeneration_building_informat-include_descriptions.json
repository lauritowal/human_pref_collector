        "This grant proposal addresses the urgent need to enhance the representational capabilities of current building modeling tools, particularly Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. Despite their widespread use, these tools primarily focus on the physical and material aspects of buildings, neglecting the critical dimensions of context, intended use, and user profiles. This limitation restricts the evaluation of buildings to narrowly defined criteria, such as structural stability and energy consumption, while overlooking the broader impacts on the lives and activities of future users. The proposed research seeks to develop a more comprehensive building modeling approach that integrates the building's purpose, function, and the social, cultural, and economic characteristics of its intended users. By incorporating these elements, the new modeling method will enable architects and designers to predict and evaluate the holistic impact of a building before it is constructed, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs and expectations of its users. This innovation is crucial in an era where the built environment significantly influences the cost, quality, and sustainability of life on Earth. The successful completion of this project will lead to more effective and user-centric building designs, ultimately contributing to the creation of more livable and sustainable communities."

Buildings, unlike other products, cannot be understood independently of their context, of their intended use, and of their intended users. This shortcoming hinders the ability of current building models to support evaluations other than those based on physical and material characteristics of the building, such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability. In particular, the impact of a building that has not yet been built on the life and activities of its future users—a key element in determining whether or not the proposed building will meet the needs of its intended users—is not afforded by current building models. To afford comprehensive prediction and evaluation of future buildings, we also need to model the purpose and function of the building, and the social, cultural, and economic profile of the people who will use it. Although predicting users' behavior in a built environment and their interaction with the building and with other people is a highly complex task, vast research exists that is devoted to analyzing and explaining human behavior in built environments. Still, due to the shortcomings of building models, this knowledge rarely make into the practice of architectural design, at the time buildings are being designed. The proposed research aims at remedying that shortcoming by developing a more a comprehensive building modeling method, which will include form, function, and use information. A better model will lead to better designed buildings. In an era when the irrevocable impact of the built environment on the cost, quality, and perhaps even possibility of life on earth has been recognized, the need to make every effort to improve the tools used by building designers is self-evident.",
