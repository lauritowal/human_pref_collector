        "Each year, 5.7 million lives are lost and 100 million individuals are thrust into extreme poverty due to inadequate access to essential public services in low-income countries (Lancet Health Commission, 2018). To address this, governments are increasingly turning to digital technologies to enhance service delivery, aiming for broader, faster, and more cost-effective access. However, in low-income settings, nearly one-third of digitalization projects fail, leading to significant resource wastage (World Development Report, 2016). Furthermore, successful projects can inadvertently exacerbate inequalities by excluding those with limited connectivity.\n\nThis research proposal seeks to deepen our understanding of the factors that determine the success or failure of public sector digitalization in developing countries and explore how digital technologies can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency and inclusivity of public service delivery. Through collaboration with local governments and NGOs, we will conduct four large-scale randomized experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. These experiments will examine digital interventions that (i) increase the demand for public services by enabling digital access and (ii) improve the supply of in-person services through remote monitoring and supervision of delivery agents.\n\nThe findings will provide critical insights for policymakers, helping to ensure that digital initiatives in low-income countries are more effective, inclusive, and sustainable, ultimately benefiting a wider population with better public services."

Governments across the globe have responded by adopting digital technologies — e.g., by making services available to citizens virtually — in the hopes of providing broader, faster, and cheaper access to public services. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in this regard, low-income countries continue to struggle with nearly one-third of digitalization projects being abandoned and substantial resources being wasted (World Development Report, 2016). Moreover, even when successful, these digitization projects they risk excluding vulnerable individuals with limited connectivity, potentially widening existing inequalities. This research proposal aims to advance our understanding of (i) the determinants of the success or failure of digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, and (ii) the ways digital technologies can be harnessed to improve the efficiency and inclusion of public service delivery, thereby producing more robust and inclusive economic growth. In collaboration with local governments and NGOs, I will design and carry out four large-scale randomized experiments in countries where public services are being digitized (India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Liberia). In these experiments, I will study digital technologies that influence (i) the demand for public services by allowing citizens to access them digitally, and (ii) the supply of in-person services by remotely monitoring or supervising the delivery agents. The results will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately helping a broader segment of the population access more and higher quality public services.",
