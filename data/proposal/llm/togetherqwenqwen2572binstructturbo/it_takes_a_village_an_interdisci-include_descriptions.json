        "**Abstract:**\n\nInterCom is a pioneering research initiative that explores the complex dynamics of intergenerational communication through an innovative blend of laboratory and real-world studies. Despite the ubiquity of interactions between individuals of different ages, the neural mechanisms that underpin these exchanges remain largely unexplored. This project seeks to address critical questions: Do age-related changes in brain rhythms impact conversational fluency? How do listeners adapt to speech from younger or older speakers? Are intergenerational communication gaps partly due to differences in predictive processing? To answer these questions, InterCom adopts a 'community neuroscience' approach, integrating naturalistic observations with controlled experiments. We will gather brain, behavioral, and linguistic data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during community storytelling events. These events, co-designed with local partners, will provide rich, real-world data that will inform and refine subsequent laboratory studies. By iteratively cycling between naturalistic and experimental settings, InterCom aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the neurocognitive processes that facilitate or hinder communication across generations. This research will not only advance our scientific knowledge but also generate practical tools and insights to enhance intergenerational communication in various social contexts."

InterCom combines laboratory research with real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal analyses with interpersonal measures (e.g. ‘brain-to-brain synchrony’), to better understand multi-generational communication, both within and beyond family contexts. Do age-related differences in brain rhythms inhibit conversational flow? How do listeners process speech produced by children or older adults? Can intergenerational miscommunications be partly attributed to the fact that children and older adults are less likely to predict what others are about to say? How can we overcome implicit neurobehavioral culprits of misalignment? Curiously, while laboratory studies have shown that there are significant differences in how children, adults, and older adults process (non)verbal information, these and related questions remain largely unanswered. InterCom will test a novel ‘community neuroscience’ approach, one that flows from the real world, to the lab, and back. We will collect brain, body, and language data from socio-culturally diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events that are co-designed with community partners. The data collected during these events will then inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies and vice versa. As such, InterCom leverages the benefits while offsetting the downsides of both naturalistic observations and experimental control, and will innovate on and combine laboratory and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and data analysis in a truly reciprocal manner. Together, InterCom will tread previously uncharted territory in both intergenerational and real-world neuroscience research to generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations.",
