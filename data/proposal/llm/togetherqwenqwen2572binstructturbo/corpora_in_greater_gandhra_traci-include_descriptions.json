    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project focused on the analysis of recently discovered Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts from the Gilgit/Bamiyan script tradition, originating from the historical region of Greater Gandhāra, which spans modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Northern India. The project primarily examines two significant collections: one unearthed from the Mes Aynak site in Afghanistan and another from a private collection in Thailand. These manuscripts, dating from the early first millennium CE, offer unprecedented insights into the textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects of Buddhist literature during this crucial period. The research will employ a multifaceted approach, integrating philological, paleographical, and codicological methods to explore the production, transmission, and cultural context of these texts. A key outcome of the project will be the creation of a digital archive, including an akṣara database of individual syllables to identify scribes and scriptorium networks, digital preservation of the manuscripts, and the production of critical editions and translations. This project aims to deepen our understanding of the early Buddhist textual traditions and their impact on the broader cultural and religious landscape of the region."

In the last several years, fantastic manuscript finds have surfaced opening new windows into the scholarly study of the development of Buddhist literature. I am one of the few scholars to have access to such material. This project represents a multifaceted, holistic approach to the study of an important and voluminous genre of manuscript witnesses from an early era of Buddhist textual transmission composed in Sanskrit in the Gilgit/Bamiyan type scripts from the historic region of Greater Gandhāra covering modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Northern India. This project centers the study of two large, recently discovered caches of highly important early Buddhist Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts and their place in the body of works from Greater Gandhāra. The first cache was excavated from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and the second is a collection of newly identified manuscripts held in a private collection in Thailand. The philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research conducted in this project will examine textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks in the Buddhist manuscript cultures of Greater Gandhāra and beyond in the first millennium of the Common Era. These results will be made permanently available through the development of a digital archive allowing for the creation of an akṣara database of individual syllables representing unique scribal identifiers, which will identify individual scribes across manuscripts and scriptorium networks, digital preservation of the manuscripts, their editions and translations, study of their textual, paleographical, and codicological features, and the direct comparison of the content of these texts with parallels in multiple languages.",
