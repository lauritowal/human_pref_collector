        "**Abstract:**\n\nEQuaTe aims to revolutionize our understanding of early human evolution and migration across Europe by integrating cutting-edge amino acid and thermoluminescence (TL) dating techniques. The Quaternary period, spanning the last 2.6 million years, was marked by significant climatic fluctuations, sea-level changes, and shifts in flora and fauna, which in turn influenced human population dynamics. Despite the wealth of geological and archaeological data available, a precise chronology remains elusive, particularly beyond the 60,000-year limit of radiocarbon dating. EQuaTe addresses this gap by leveraging the unique properties of calcitic fossils, such as snail opercula, which serve as stable reservoirs for amino acids and provide a reliable TL signal over Quaternary timescales. By applying these dating methods in tandem, EQuaTe will establish a robust chronological framework for the entire Palaeolithic period in Eurasia, from Britain to the Black Sea. This comprehensive chronology will shed light on critical questions, such as the timing and environmental conditions of early human expansions into Europe, and the factors behind variations in tool technologies. The resulting pan-European timeline will offer unprecedented insights into the interplay between human cultural and population dynamics and environmental change, advancing our knowledge of human prehistory."

During the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years), Europe witnessed major climatic oscillations, with periodic expansion of ice sheets into lowland areas, changes of sea-level, re-organization of plant and animal communities, and the evolution and migration of human populations. Despite extensive studies of the rich European geological and archaeological records (providing a detailed history of these environmental changes), these have little meaning without a secure chronology. Dating is extremely difficult beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~60,000 years). Key to our approach is the discovery that commonly-occurring calcitic fossils (snail opercula) provide both closed-system repositories for amino acids and a stable TL signal over Quaternary timescales. It is therefore now possible to use both dating methods on the same biomineral to build a strong dating framework; taking advantage of momentum in this field, EQuATe will apply this approach on a European scale. This novel paired chronology, spanning the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia, will refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change over the last 2.6 Ma, across a region stretching from Britain to the Black Sea. EQuaTe will provide the scientific means to answer critical questions, e.g.: when did early human populations expand into Europe, and under what climatic conditions? Are apparent differences in tool technologies a reflection of different species, technical evolution over time, or geographical variations in source materials and cultural tradition? The pan-European chronology developed by this research will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand our past.",
