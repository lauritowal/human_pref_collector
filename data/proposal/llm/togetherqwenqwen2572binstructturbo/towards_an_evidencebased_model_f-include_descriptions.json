        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis ERC project aims to address critical research gaps in big data policing by integrating multidisciplinary perspectives to develop and evaluate an evidence-based model. Big data policing leverages historical crime data, socio-economic indicators, and advanced technologies to predict and prevent crime, optimizing police resource allocation. Despite its potential, current knowledge and expertise in this field are fragmented, particularly in Europe. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of big data policing has not been fully explored, and there is a dearth of rigorous scientific evaluations of existing models. To tackle these issues, this project will unite statistical, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions of big data policing. Through a series of randomized controlled trials, we will test the efficacy and reliability of our integrated model, ensuring it meets high standards of transparency, validity, and ethical compliance. Additionally, the project will foster an international and interdisciplinary approach by incorporating PhD tracks focused on these specific dimensions, thereby enhancing the overall understanding and application of big data policing. This innovative approach seeks to surpass the limitations of current commercial initiatives, which often lack transparency and robust scientific validation."

Big data policing models can consist of variables based on crime data available in police databases (e.g. previous crime events), socio-economic data (e.g. poverty index, residential mobility), opportunity characteristics (e.g. the presence of shops, distance to nearest highway), data from new technologies (e.g. intelligent cameras) and other known predictors of crime (e.g. police patrol intensity). However, there are several research gaps that need to be addressed. First, knowledge about and expertise in big data policing in Europe is currently fragmented. Second, there is a lack of interdisciplinarity with regard to big data policing studies, and yet the involvement of several disciplines is required when studying the issue. Third, there is a lack of scientific evaluations of big data policing models. The overarching objective of this ERC project is to unite and integrate the statistical-methodological, criminological, legal and ethical dimensions of big data policing in an evidence-based model that will be tested by different randomized controlled trials and built on the principles of an international (i.e. European) and interdisciplinary approach. The latter aim should be enabled by incorporating and conducting different PhD tracks focusing on these specific dimensions, which should allow better knowledge, insights and understanding of big data policing to be developed. This approach is innovative and radically different from the existing commercial and economic initiatives, which lack transparency on their predictive reliability and validity, effectiveness and legal and ethical safeguards.",
