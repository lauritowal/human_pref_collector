        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant proposal aims to develop a cutting-edge software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring key economic indicators, leveraging novel models and tests previously developed under the ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests project. These models, which often surpass current state-of-the-art methodologies, will be integrated into a comprehensive tool designed to enhance the reliability of economic forecasts, particularly during periods of instability. The proposed software will address critical gaps in existing forecasting tools by incorporating real-time monitoring, high-frequency data, and predictive tests for potential model breakdowns. By working closely with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, the project will focus on creating a user-friendly interface, three-dimensional graphical representations of monitoring and predictive tests, and ensuring the accessibility of these methods to key decision-makers. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust, innovative software solution that improves economic forecasts, thereby supporting more informed and effective economic policy-making. Enhanced forecasting accuracy can significantly impact the growth, economic stability, and social welfare of countries, firms, and individuals."

In the ERC-funded starting grant (ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests) we developed novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators (such as economic activity, financial volatility and others) as well as evaluating the reliability of model predictions. In many cases our methods improve upon the current-state-of-art. The idea of this ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant is to use these novel models and tests to develop a software/toolbox that forecasts and monitors economic indicators. Most available forecasting software lack real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests which are important for reliable forecasts especially in periods of instability. Our forecasting and monitoring toolbox can improve the reliability of forecasts as follows: (1) using a novel family of models and high frequency information (2) monitoring forecasts in real-time (3) using new predictive tests of potential breakdowns. Such economic forecasts are at the heart of economic decision making made by governments, Central Banks, and firms that are potential users of our toolbox. In this ERC PoC we will initially work with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, given contacts have already been established, in order to examine various aspects of the development of this toolbox such as: building a user-friendly software, developing a three-dimensional graphical representation of the monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, and generally making our new methods accessible to decision makers. The overall objective of this ERC PoC grant is to provide a software with innovative techniques that can improve economic forecasts and thereby economic decision making. Reliable economic forecasts can lead to prudent economic policy making and affect the growth, economic and social welfare of countries, firms and individuals.",
