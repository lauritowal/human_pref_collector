        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project aims to explore the historical and contemporary experiences of boat refugees, focusing on the dynamics of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary. From the Jewish refugees of the 1940s Mediterranean to the Vietnamese boat people of the 1970s and 1980s South China Sea, and the more recent influx of refugees across the Mediterranean in 2015, this project seeks to understand the complex interplay of factors that shaped the journeys and receptions of these individuals. The central research question examines how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influenced the experiences of boat refugees across different periods and regions. To address this, the project will investigate who assisted and who obstructed the refugees during their voyages, both at sea and upon arrival. The research will explore four key areas: solidarity among refugees on board, assistance from non-state actors such as merchant ships and NGOs, state responses to boat refugees, and the attainment of sanctuary post-journey. The project's innovative approach includes a focus on maritime perspectives, an examination of non-state actors, and a comparative analysis across time and space. Utilizing a rich array of sources, including interviews, oral histories, state archives, NGO records, legal documents, and media coverage, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the boat refugee experience, contributing to broader debates on migration, humanitarianism, and international law."

This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 198In 2015, over one million boat refugees sailed across the Mediterranean. This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 1980s and 1990s, Cubans and Haitians tried to navigate the Caribbean to reach the US; and in the 1990s and 2000s, boat refugees sailed across the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Australia, Yemen, and Europe respectively. The central research question framing this project is: how did notions of solidarity, sovereignty and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? The research team will be guided by the related sub-question: who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? Each of the sub-projects will examine a) whether there was solidarity onboard between boat refugees, b) whether boat refugees encountered solidarity from non-state actors, such as merchant vessels, fishing boats and NGO search and rescue missions, c) how states responded to boat refugees at sea, and d) whether boat refugees attained sanctuary after their journey. This projectâ€™s ground-breaking character lies in three aspects: 1) thinking through seas, 2) going beyond the state, and 3) comparing the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space. The main sources that the project will rely upon will be interviews with boat refugees, non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage.",
