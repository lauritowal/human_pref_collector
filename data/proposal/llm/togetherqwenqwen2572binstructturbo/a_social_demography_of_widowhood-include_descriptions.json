    "descriptions": [
        "Widowhood, a critical life event characterized by significant emotional and economic upheaval, is increasingly prevalent in aging societies. Despite this, many countries have reduced or eliminated survival benefits, exacerbating the adverse impacts on bereaved individuals. This research aims to advance the understanding of widowhood by developing a comprehensive social demography framework. The project innovates by integrating a novel conceptual and methodological approach to assess both the risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood. Risk is defined as the probability and duration of widowhood, while vulnerability encompasses its mental health and economic repercussions. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on immediate changes in wellbeing following sudden bereavement, this research examines the broader and often overlooked impact of the prolonged process of expected widowhood, where the spouse's health declines over time. The study will investigate social inequalities in widowhood risk and vulnerability across socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age. Additionally, it will explore country-level differences and temporal changes, utilizing harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from up to 60 countries with varying demographic trends and welfare systems, spanning from 1985 to 2050. By providing systematic and comprehensive estimates, this research will offer valuable insights into the challenges faced by the growing widowed population and their families, ultimately informing the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems."

Although the frequency of this high risk event is increasing across ageing societies, many countries have cut survival benefits exposing more bereaved spouses to dire short- and long-term consequences. Despite its growing relevance, widowhood research remains underdeveloped compared to other disruptive events, such as divorce. This ground-breaking research moves beyond the state-of-the-art in at least four ways to establish a social demography of widowhood. (1) The foundation of my project lies in an innovative conceptual and methodological approach to the risk and vulnerability to widowhood. While risk aims at the probability and duration of widowhood, vulnerability focuses on its mental health and economic consequences. Current assessments of widowhood effects are limited to change in wellbeing directly after bereavement with a special focus on unexpected deaths. However, the most prevalent scenario entails a process of terminal health decline in the years before death. The consequences of the often neglected longer process of expected widowhood may be larger than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood. Three ground-breaking pillars build on risk and vulnerability to examine (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity and nativity, social support networks, gender and age, as well as (3) country differences and (4) change over time. High-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources will be harmonized and applied to an advanced set of statistical methods for up to 60 ageing countries varying in demographic trends and welfare systems from 1985 with projections to 2050. A social demography of widowhood will supplement fragmented evidence with systematic and comprehensive estimates on risk and vulnerability, provide insights into the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems.",
