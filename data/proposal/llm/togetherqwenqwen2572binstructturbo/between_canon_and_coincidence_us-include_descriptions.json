        "The BECACO project introduces a pioneering multidisciplinary approach to the study of the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections, focusing on the socio-politico-historical contexts that facilitated the translocation of cultural artifacts. By reconceptualizing provenance research beyond the study of individual objects or collectors, the project develops the concept of Art World Patterns, an extension of the Art Worlds theory. This framework will be applied to a large-scale analysis of Indigenous Latin American material housed in 12 museums across 9 countries. Utilizing advanced data-driven methodologies, including quantitative analysis, network analysis, and data mining, the project aims to uncover the complex networks and historical processes that shaped the collection and representation of these artifacts in Europe from 1850 to 2000. The BECACO team will create a comprehensive, diachronic, and cross-institutional understanding of how the Indigenous Latin American Art World was constructed in Europe, influencing contemporary perceptions and academic discourse. Through this innovative approach, the project will not only advance the field of provenance research but also contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cultural heritage and its global circulation."

Moving away from the current focus in provenance research on single objects, collectors, or institutions, the aim of the project is to reconceptualize provenance as the large-scale study of the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material. To do so, it introduces the concept of Art World Patterns, an expansion and reframing of the idea of Art Worlds (Becker 2008[1982]). These patterns will be identified through an innovative combination of various data-driven methodologies. By applying quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data, the project will explore the promises and limitations of different data-driven approaches in the context of large-scale ethnographic/archaeological provenance research. Through this process, the project will devise new models for provenance research in ethnographic and archaeological museums. These conceptual and methodological advances will be mobilized through the study of Indigenous Latin American material from 12 museums in 9 countries. The project will create a ground-breaking diachronic, international, and cross-institutional understanding of the collecting of Indigenous Latin American material in Europe. In doing so, the BECACO team will reconstruct how – through the formation of collections – the Indigenous Latin American Art World as it existed in Europe between 1850-2000 constructed a discourse of art, aesthetics, and academic research that shaped how Indigenous Latin America is represented and understood in Europe until today.",
