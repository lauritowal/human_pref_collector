        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe PRILA project aims to explore the mechanisms for securing rights, accountability, and adherence to the rule of law within European prisons. Recognizing the significant power imbalances inherent in these institutions, PRILA will provide the first comprehensive account of how legal and administrative systems function to ensure fair treatment and uphold the rights of prisoners. This research is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the penal system and promoting a just and orderly environment, reflecting core European values in penal policy and law. By examining the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability body personnel, PRILA will offer a nuanced understanding of the structures in place for ensuring that decisions and actions within prisons are transparent, consistent, and subject to review. The project will integrate insights from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, employing a mix of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods. PRILA will also investigate how these accountability structures reflect underlying penal ideologies and prison regimes. By grounding theoretical concepts in practical experiences, the project will enhance judicial and legal frameworks, contributing to the development of more effective penal policies that better protect the rule of law and human rights in the prison setting. This work is essential for advancing the European commitment to justice and fairness within the penal system."

Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context.",
