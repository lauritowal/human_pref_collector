        "**Abstract:**\n\nOnline hate speech and disinformation pose significant threats to democratic societies, prompting governments, companies, and civil society to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) for detection and mitigation. However, these efforts are hindered by the limitations of training datasets and the lack of culturally contextualized procedural frameworks, leading to false positives and systemic biases. The proposed project, \"AI4Dignity,\" aims to address these challenges by developing a collaborative, bottom-up coding model that integrates cultural context into AI-assisted moderation. By engaging fact-checkers as key human interlocutors, AI4Dignity pioneers a community-based classification approach that enhances the accuracy and fairness of AI systems. The project will establish a replicable process model, facilitating collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries through structured events. An open-access toolkit will be created to support the adoption of this model in diverse contexts, setting new procedural benchmarks for inclusive training datasets and operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle. AI4Dignity represents a critical step towards more effective and culturally aware solutions to digital hate and disinformation."

Governments, companies and civil society groups have responded to this phenomenon by increasingly turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool that can detect, decelerate and remove online extreme speech. However, such efforts confront many challenges. One of the key challenges is the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets. The second challenge is the lack of procedural guidelines and frameworks that can bring cultural contextualization to these systems. Lack of cultural contextualization has resulted in false positives, over-application and systemic bias. The ongoing ERC project has identified the need for a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions in order to address cultural variation, since there is no catch-all algorithm that can work for different contexts. Following this, the proposed project will address major challenges facing AI assisted extreme speech moderation by developing an innovative solution of collaborative bottom-up coding. The model, “AI4Dignity”, moves beyond keyword-based detection systems by pioneering a community-based classification approach. It identifies fact-checkers as critical human interlocutors who can bring cultural contextualization to AI-assisted speech moderation in a meaningful and feasible manner. The project will develop a replicable process model that will enable collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers and academic intermediaries in a facilitated event space. The project will develop an open access toolkit for the adoption of this model in different locations. AI4Dignity will be a significant step towards setting procedural benchmarks to operationalize “the human in the loop” principle and bring inclusive training datasets for AI systems tackling urgent issues of digital hate and disinformation.",
