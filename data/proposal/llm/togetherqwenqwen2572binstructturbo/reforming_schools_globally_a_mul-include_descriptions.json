    "descriptions": [
        "In the face of global economic challenges, numerous countries are under pressure to enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of their education systems. A prominent strategy in this context is the adoption of School Autonomy with Accountability (SAWA) policies, which are being promoted internationally, particularly by organizations like the OECD. These policies aim to modernize public education by granting schools greater autonomy while simultaneously holding them accountable for performance outcomes. Despite their widespread adoption, the effectiveness of SAWA policies in improving learning outcomes and equity remains a subject of debate, with existing research yielding mixed and inconclusive findings.\n\nThe REFORMED project seeks to address these gaps by developing a comprehensive research framework that examines the global dissemination of SAWA policies and their contextual implementation. The project will explore the mechanisms through which SAWA policies are adopted and adapted across different levels, from international policy agendas to local school settings. By analyzing the roles of various stakeholders, including international bureaucrats, national policymakers, and educators, the project aims to uncover the institutional and contextual factors that influence the success of SAWA policies.\n\nUsing a multi-scalar and mixed-methods approach, REFORMED will combine quantitative data on educational outcomes with qualitative insights from policy actors. This robust methodology will provide a nuanced understanding of how SAWA policies are shaped and enacted, and under what conditions they effectively contribute to educational improvement. The findings will have significant implications for policy development and educational reform, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners worldwide."

In this scenario, managerial policy ideas such as school autonomy and accountability, which aim to modernize public education and strengthen its performance, are spreading broadly. To date, a wide range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development have adopted school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, whilst the most active international organizations in the education sector, like the OECD, are strongly promoting them globally. Constituting SAWA as a global model of education reform generates two main questions. First, why and how are SAWA policies disseminating globally, and to what extent does this reform model generate international policy convergence in education? Secondly, how and under what particular contextual and institutional circumstances do SAWA policies work and for whom? The fact that existing scholarly research has achieved inconclusive and mixed findings concerning the SAWA effects on learning outcomes and equity makes this second question especially relevant. To address these gaps in existing literature, REFORMED develops a comprehensive research approach that scrutinizes the different, but mutually constitutive stages of global education policy, from the inception in global agendas stage to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. Specifically, the project analyzes how and why SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors operating at different scales (from international bureaucrats to teachers), and inquires into the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that explain the different effects of SAWA at the school level. A robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods will contribute to advancing such an innovative approach.",
