        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal responds to the UNâ€™s Decade of Action (2020-2030) by addressing the critical challenge of violent extremism. Despite significant efforts, progress in this area has been limited due to theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings. To overcome these gaps, this project introduces and empirically tests a comprehensive multi-theoretical framework for understanding radicalization leading to violence and deradicalization. The framework aims to develop robust intervention programs by elucidating the underlying mechanisms of these processes. \n\nThe project is divided into four work packages (WPs). WP1 focuses on developing a multi-theory model that integrates various perspectives on radicalization and deradicalization. WP2 involves the creation of an innovative data collection platform, enabling the assessment of these processes through dynamic and interactive measures across large, diverse samples from five continents. WP3 delves into the mechanisms of radicalization both inside and outside prisons, conducting in-depth interviews and online experiments in ten countries (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan) to infer causality. Finally, WP4 will develop evidence-based programs to prevent radicalization in prisons and to deradicalize incarcerated violent extremist offenders.\n\nThis project will advance the scientific understanding of violent extremism by generating unique empirical data from a global sample of violent extremist offenders and by providing novel, evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism."

This call is grounded in the insufficient progress achieved despite the vast efforts from Governments and scholars to tackle this issue. The main shortcomings of previous approaches are (1) theoretical (poor consensus about the nature and causes), (2) empirical (infrequent access to populations of interest), and (3) methodological (research designs that do not allow to test for causality, no comparative studies, over-reliance on qualitative data). I am going to introduce and test empirically the first comprehensive multi-theoretical framework for the study of radicalization leading to violence and deradicalization by understanding its nature to develop intervention programs. In part one (WP1) I will develop a multi-theory model for the nature and mechanisms underlying radicalization leading to violence and deradicalization. In WP2 I will develop an innovative methodology to assess these processes by a platform for data collection including dynamic and interactive measures of radicalization and deradicalization in large samples in five continents. WP3 will examine the mechanisms underlying radicalization outside and inside prisons in 10 nations (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan) through interviews, combined with online cross-sectional and longitudinal experiments to allow the inference of causality. WP4 will focus on the development of evidence-based programs designed to prevent radicalization in prisons and to conduct de-radicalization with incarcerated violent extremist offenders. The contributions of this framework are twofold: a) advancing the scientific understanding of violent extremism by collecting unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders collected worldwide, and b) providing novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism.",
