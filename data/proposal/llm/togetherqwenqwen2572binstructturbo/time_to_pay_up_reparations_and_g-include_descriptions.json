        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe REPAIR project seeks to explore the evolving landscape of reparations in global development, focusing on the demands and implications of reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and environmental pollution. By comparing how reparations are established, implemented, and perceived across these diverse contexts, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of their multifaceted roles. REPAIR's objectives include analyzing the economic, moral, and political dimensions of reparations, identifying the nature of wealth transfers involved, and examining the broader implications for economic life. This innovative study is the first to apply a comparative social-science approach to reparations in development, utilizing novel theories and methods from economic anthropology. Through this interdisciplinary lens, REPAIR promises to offer new insights into the sociocultural and economic impacts of reparations, ultimately enriching our understanding of how reparative measures can address historical and contemporary injustices."

Disenfranchised groups from around the world and countries from the Global South increasingly call for reparations. They ask for apologies for past harm, symbolic and institutional measures that recognize and prevent such harm, and – most controversially – for monetary payments. Reparations are meant to respond to environmental pollution, mitigate the worst effects of climate change, compensate for infectious disease outbreaks and terrorist attacks, and bring some degree of justice for indigenous peoples and other minorities. REPAIR studies these new calls for reparations that address different global development challenges. It compares reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. The project’s research objectives are: 1. Compare how reparations payments are established, implemented and received as part of addressing these global development challenges 2. Learn what these payments teach us about reparations in development, from an economic, moral and political perspective 3. Identify what kind of wealth transfer reparations constitute, and what this tells us about the “reparative aspects” of economic life more generally. REPAIR is innovative in that it is the first comparative social-science study of reparations in the field of development. It not only analyses a new and important set of reparations cases, but drastically broadens the comparative frame of their study. Moreover, REPAIR is the first research project to use novel theory and methods from economic anthropology to study reparations. This promises relevant new insights into their sociocultural nature and effects. Lastly, by investigating reparations as a form of wealth transfer and focusing on the “reparative aspects” of economic activity, REPAIR hopes to push the boundaries of our understanding of economic life in general.",
