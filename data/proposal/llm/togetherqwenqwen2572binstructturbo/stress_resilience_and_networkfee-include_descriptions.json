        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal aims to advance our understanding of how acute stress impacts cognitive functions by examining the dynamic shifts in large-scale neural network balance. Despite extensive research at the cellular level, the translation of these findings to the systems level remains unclear. The hypothesis is that acute stress dynamically reallocates neural resources across large-scale networks, affecting cognitive performance. To test this, the project will employ cutting-edge network connectivity modeling to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of these shifts during stress and recovery. Wearable biosensors and mobile applications will be utilized to identify neural markers that predict stress resilience in real-world settings. These markers will be cross-validated in a patient group with high stress sensitivity to ensure their clinical relevance. The roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in generating these rapid network shifts will be investigated, providing insights into the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms. Additionally, the project will explore how shifts in network balance can disrupt specific cognitive functions. To translate these findings into practical applications, a network-based functional MRI neurofeedback system will be developed to train participants to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. Success in this project will provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms of stress response, validate biomarkers of stress resilience, and introduce a new method for enhancing stress resilience."

Repeated exposure to stressors is furthermore a critical transdiagnostic factor in etiology, relapse, and chronification in almost all psychiatric disorders. We know from animal work at the cellular level how stressors trigger a neurochemical cascade that alters properties of widespread neuronal populations. A critical gap in our knowledge, however, is how such cellular effects translate to the level of large-scale neural systems which implement higher-order cognition. Here, I propose a novel framework for understanding such alterations as shifts in network balance: I hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at the level of large-scale networks. First, I will leverage recent advances in network connectivity modeling to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of such shifts during acute stress and recovery. Using wearable biosensors and mobile applications, I aim to identify which neural markers predict resilience to stress in real life. Second, I will cross-validate these markers in a patient group characterized by high stress sensitivity. Third, to investigate how rapid network shifts are generated, I will examine the distinct roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems. Fourth, I will test the hypothesis that cognitive functions supported by one network can be disrupted by shifting balance towards another. Finally, I will develop a network-based implementation of functional MRI neurofeedback to train stress-sensitive participants to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. When successful, this project will yield 1) unprecedented insight into how our brain adapts to acute stress; 2) novel ecologically validated transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience versus sensitivity; and 3) a potentially groundbreaking method for training stress resilience.",
