        "This research project seeks to explore the transformative impact of photography on the acceptance and understanding of bacteriological explanations of infectious diseases during the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). By collecting and analyzing all visual documents related to this global health crisis, the project aims to reveal how photography reshaped public consciousness of infectious diseases, hygiene, and the importance of international cooperation in public health. The study will focus on the role of visual representations in establishing plague as a symbol of death and disorder in the modern era, while also highlighting the active negotiation of health emergencies on a cross-cultural, global scale. The project will conduct a historical and anthropological analysis of the visual records from four key regions: China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America. Each region will be studied by dedicated researchers, with a focus on four interconnected aspects: the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death and burial practices, and issues of race, class, and discrimination. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the project aims to uncover the complex ways in which visual media influenced geopolitical, colonial, and biopolitical relations, ultimately shaping the social imagination of a new era of globalized hygienic modernity."

The project will collect and analyse for the first time all visual documents of the third plague pandemic, which broke out in 1855 in Southwest China and raged across the globe until 1959, causing the death of approximately 12 million people. The projectâ€™s aim is to engage in a historical and anthropological analysis of this global network of visual representations, underlining how it played a crucial role in the negotiation of geopolitical, colonial and biopolitical relations at the turn of the 20th century, with great bearing on public health consciousness and the social imagination of a new era of globalised hygienic modernity. Research will focus on four regions: China and Japan; India; Africa; South and North America, the first investigated by the Principal Investigator, while the rest being allocated to 3 postdoctoral researchers, all employed full-time in the project. While investigating the visual record of plague in their respective regions, researchers will engage in a collaborative and interdisciplinary analysis of the entangled history of the visual representation of the third pandemic, taking as a common analytical ground 4 different but vitally interlinked aspects of the visual representation of the pandemic: a) the built environment; b) civil disturbance and public order; c) death, corpses and burial; d) race, class and discrimination.",
