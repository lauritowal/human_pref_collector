        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe LANDRESPONSE project seeks to explore the intricate relationships between land dispossession, elite capture, and the escalating violent resistance and migration patterns observed among smallholders in the Sahel, with a specific focus on Mali. We hypothesize that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to engage in violent resistance or migrate due to the loss of their livelihoods and the pressures from rent-seeking elites. This project will employ mixed-methods research to examine the nature of these links, aiming to identify why some smallholders opt for violent resistance while others choose migration. By integrating theoretical frameworks from political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, LANDRESPONSE will provide innovative insights into the motivations and agency of smallholders in the face of these challenges. The findings will not only advance academic understanding but also offer valuable policy recommendations for addressing the complex interplay between land governance, conflict, and migration in the region."

The hypothesis of LANDRESPONSE is that smallholders who are dispossessed of access to land are more inclined to either migrate or resist violently. Violent resistance will be studied in this project with regard to the increasing numbers of armed groups labelled ‘jihadist’ in the Sahel and in particular in Mali. The project will investigate the nature of the links between land dispossession and elite capture on the one hand and violent jihadist resistance to governments as well as migration to North Africa and Europe on the other hand. These hypothesized links will be investigated using mixed methods with a particular focus on Mali as a ‘hub’ country in the Western Sahel in terms of both violence and migration. Following this conceptual framework, the objectives directing the project will be – first to investigate whether smallholders in the West African Sahel who are dispossessed of their land and/or fall victim to rent-seeking elites, are more inclined to either resist violently or migrate, and second try to assess why some smallholders are more prone to resist, even violently, while others remain compliant. With its pioneering engagement with these urgent political issues, the project will combine theoretical and empirical approaches from political ecology, critical agrarian studies and peace and conflict studies to generate novel insights about the motivations and agency of smallholders confronted with emerging challenges to their livelihoods. This interdisciplinary research will generate new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts and migration, which will both push the research frontier and provide new ideas for policy formulation.",
