    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nOsciLang aims to develop an affordable, wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) neurofeedback system designed to diagnose and treat language disorders, focusing on dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). Current neurofeedback protocols lack established methods for addressing these conditions. OsciLang will introduce a novel neurofeedback approach based on the phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech signals. This method will enable the detection and enhancement of an individual’s brain-speech synchronization, crucial for effective language processing. Our previous research has shown that dyslexic readers exhibit reduced auditory tracking in the delta band compared to typical readers, indicating impaired auditory processing. By leveraging this finding, OsciLang will implement neurofeedback training protocols to improve brain-speech synchronization, particularly in challenging environments. The system will feature a user-friendly interface that provides real-time feedback on participants' brain activity, measured via EEG, allowing them to modulate their neural oscillations. Specifically, OsciLang will monitor phase coherence in the theta and delta bands, a pioneering approach in neurofeedback technology. This project will not only advance the treatment of language disorders but also lay the groundwork for a broader framework to enhance literacy skills in the general population."

To date there is no established neurofeedback protocols for treating language or reading impairments. In essence, this tool will (a) diagnose/measure and (b) improve/rehabilitate an individual’s ability to synchronize their brain’s activity with changes in a speech signal. This novel type of neurofeedback, based on phase coherence of the neural oscillatory activity with speech, will allow us to detect and enhance language function. It capitalizes on our recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, where we found reduced auditory tracking in delta band in dyslexic readers compared with controls, advocating impaired auditory processing in dyslexia. Thus, our work and related findings suggest that literacy skills in dyslexics will improve by means of neurofeedback training protocols that enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, especially in noisy environments. OsciLang will help to sustainably enhance brain-speech synchronization strength by allowing participants to shape their neural activity while tracking speech. This will be accomplished by presenting participants with a simple and friendly interface that quantifies basic parameters of their brain activity in real time, measured via EEG. This information can then be used by participants to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Based on our prior findings, OsciLang’ algorithms will be monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, an innovative approach that has yet to be implemented in a neurofeedback system. Oscilang will also lay the foundations for extending this novel approach to provide a general framework and technology for enhancing any individual’s ability to learn to read.",
