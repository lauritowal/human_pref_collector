    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe ability to understand and interact with others' mental states is a cornerstone of human social cognition, yet it remains one of the most complex and understudied aspects of brain function. This project seeks to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social interaction by bridging the gap between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model that elucidates how shared neural representations of the social world are maintained and communicated between individuals. Utilizing cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and advanced signal analysis methods, we will investigate the temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals during naturalistic social interactions. Specifically, we aim to test three hypotheses: (1) selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interactions supports interpersonal understanding; (2) similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with increasingly synchronous brain activity; and (3) intense emotional experiences enhance the synchronization of brain responses and the flow of information between brains. The findings from this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the brain dynamics underlying social interaction and may catalyze a paradigm shift in the field of social and cognitive neuroscience."

Studying how social information is represented similarly across individual brains and how it flows from brain to brain poses huge conceptual and technical challenges for neuroscientists, who have consequently resorted to experiments using simplistic and impoverished social stimuli. However, recent advances in brain signal analysis enable us to study the brain basis of social interaction under naturalistic settings with unparalleled accuracy. This neuroimaging project aims to bridge the gap between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience by building a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The framework relies on testing the assumption that similarities in sensory and higher-order processing across individuals can be quantified by measuring temporal synchronization of their brain activity. We use novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition for testing i) whether selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, ii) whether similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with increasingly synchronous brain activity, and iii) whether intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and flow of information from brain to brain. The results will significantly improve our understanding of the brain dynamics of social interaction, and the proposed naturalistic neuroscience approach and will potentially contribute to a significant paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience.",
