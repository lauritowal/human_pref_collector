        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn response to the pressing need for enhanced ocean protection and sustainable management, the European Commission is developing a Digital Twin of the Ocean (DTO) as part of a broader global initiative. This DTO aims to provide advanced, accurate digital models of the ocean to facilitate better decision-making for public and private stakeholders. However, the creation and deployment of DTOs present significant socio-political challenges, including the risk of exacerbating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties around data access and ownership, and the potential for misuse without proper governance. The TwinPolitics project seeks to address these challenges by examining the socio-technical processes and political dynamics involved in the development and use of DTOs. Specifically, TwinPolitics will explore how DTOs are shaped by national scientific and political objectives, and how they intersect with international norms, rules, and values. By combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, the project will analyze the practices, policies, and politics of DTOs in key regions (EU, USA, China) and their role in multilateral negotiations. TwinPolitics aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the socio-technical and political dimensions of DTOs, contributing to the responsible and equitable advancement of ocean science and governance."

The EU DTO is part of a larger set of substantial global and national efforts to develop highly accurate digital models of the ocean for ‘better decision-making’ and an emerging high-tech knowledge infrastructure that turns various types of ocean data into prediction tools for public and private actors with a stake in the transition towards sustainable ocean futures. However, DTOs, although needed to advance ocean science and governance, are a political issue in themselves. Firstly, DTOs run the risk of perpetuating global inequalities because the capacities to develop, access, and use ocean data, information, and science are unequally distributed. Secondly, DTOs may create an array of legal and political uncertainties regarding data access, ownership, security, and sharing. Thirdly, DTOs should be embedded into a set of norms, rules, and values to prevent abuse and misuse in practice — a neglected aspect in the current ‘twin rush’. TwinPolitics will overcome shortcomings in the study of DTOs by examining both the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes and the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting. TwinPolitics will re-conceptualise digital twins as socio-technical relations operating under a specific set of institutional, political, and economic conditions and within a hybrid research, data, and observation environment. TwinPolitics will break new ground by developing a methodological approach that combines, on the one hand, qualitative and quantitative research on the practices, policies, and politics presiding over digital twins in national/regional contexts (EU, USA, China) with, on the other hand, the study of DTO use during multilateral negotiations.",
