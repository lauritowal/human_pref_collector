        "The INCOMMON project aims to explore the unique intersection of philosophy, politics, and revolutionary practices in the performing arts of 1960s and 1970s Italy. This pioneering study will systematically analyze how the concept of \"commonality\" influenced and shaped the artistic counterculture of the period. By focusing on the 'laboratory Italy' environment, INCOMMON seeks to document and contextualize the collaborative performances that emerged, spanning theater, music, visual arts, cinema, and video art. The project's objectives include the collection and contextualization of these interdisciplinary performances, the application of the 'will-to-the-common' concept to the art field, and the examination of the impact of artistic communities both locally and internationally. Additionally, INCOMMON will develop a digital archive to preserve and disseminate this rich cultural heritage, employing advanced methodologies that integrate historical, philosophical, and artistic perspectives with social network theory. This approach will not only enhance the understanding of the shared creative processes of the era but also contribute to the broader scientific and sociological discourse. Through the creation of innovative digital visualization tools,rchive will provide a comprehensive and accessible resource, ensuring that this significant period in performing arts history is preserved for future generations."

The overall objectives of INCOMMON are i) to study, collect and contextualize those encounters between theatre, music, visual arts, cinema and video art that assumed the form of performances, especially those created as collaborations between artists; ii) to apply the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ to the art field of the counterculture; iii) to underline the significance of artistic communities in the local and international scene; iv) to create a digital archive of the performances of the Italian artists of the period. The project will connect historical, philosophical and artistic debates to those in other sciences, sociology and in particular Social Network Theory,in order to reveal significant structures of meanings in the artistic community and to reveal the peculiar characteristics of shared creative processes.The methodology that will be developed is meant 1) to produce new ways of modelling the knowledge and interpretation of performing arts and 2) to create an innovative form of digital archive visualization, where rich interfaces will sustain and improve the understanding of the context and relationships analysed. INCOMMON will produce a comprehensive approach, oriented toward collection, digitalization, restoration and dissemination of direct documentation and related materials of the Italian performing arts production of the great creative, political, existential wave of the counterculture, preserving and making accessible a patrimony that otherwise will continue to be lost to future generations.",
