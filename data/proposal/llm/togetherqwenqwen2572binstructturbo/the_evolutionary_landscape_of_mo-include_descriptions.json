        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe origins of Homo sapiens are increasingly understood within a complex, multi-faceted framework that extends beyond the traditional narrative of an African genesis. Recent fossil discoveries, advanced dating techniques, and genomic analyses have revealed a timeline that reaches back nearly 750,000 years, embedding modern human origins in a period marked by significant climatic and ecological shifts. The Early Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), a 1-million-year period beginning around 1.4 million years ago, was characterized by increased climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, which dramatically altered African environments and the faunal landscape. NGIPALAJEM seeks to elucidate the interplay between these environmental changes and the evolution of our species. Through extensive fieldwork in Turkana, the project aims to expand the hominin fossil record of this critical period, providing new empirical data to address fundamental questions about human evolution. Additionally, NGIPALAJEM will enhance the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana, conducting detailed eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic analyses to explore the broader evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities and the potential role of human predation in shaping modern African fauna. The project will also apply novel morphometric and analytical techniques to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years, revealing a greater range of phenotypic diversity than previously recognized. By integrating these multidisciplinary approaches, NGIPALAJEM will offer a comprehensive understanding of how the evolution of Homo sapiens is intricately linked to the broader African evolutionary landscape."

New fossils, dates and genomic studies have consolidated our African origin. Yet, they also indicate a deeper past, involving multiple events. These events stretch to nearly three quarters of a million years ago (Ma), and take the problem of modern human origins into an entirely different climatic and ecological context. From 1.4 Ma, climate dynamics changed, initiating a 1 million-year period (EMPT) during which, besides greater climatic variability, there is a prolonged arid phase, profoundly affecting African environments. By the end of the EMPT, the structure of the large mammal community in East Africa had changed significantly. The first modern humans are part of this change. The recognition of this older, drier context for the evolution of our species drives NGIPALAJEM. The proposed research aims to establish major empirical benchmarks to answer big questions. First, building on new hominin discoveries in Turkana, NGIPALAJEM will undertake extensive fieldwork to add more specimens to the scarce hominin fossil record of this period. Second, it will increase the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana, and carry out inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses to throw light on the wider evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities, and investigate the role human predation may have played in shaping modern African faunas. Third, new fossils, such as the new small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins that will be described as part of the project, show that the range of hominin phenotypic diversity in the MP is greater than expected, and so novel morphometric and analytical techniques will be applied to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The outcomes of NGIPALAJEM will bring a new understanding of how the evolution of our species is part of a broader and longer African evolutionary landscape.",
