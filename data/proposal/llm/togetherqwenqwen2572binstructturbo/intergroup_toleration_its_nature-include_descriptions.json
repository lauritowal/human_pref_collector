        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn an era marked by increasing societal diversity, the challenge of fostering harmonious coexistence among different groups is more critical than ever. This proposal aims to explore the social psychology of intergroup toleration, a crucial yet under-researched aspect of living with diversity. Unlike studies that focus on intergroup stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination, this project delves into the mechanisms and limits of toleration, where differences are not merely accepted but endured. The research will systematically investigate four key dimensions: the psychological underpinnings of tolerance, the processes that facilitate acceptance, the boundaries of toleration, and the social psychological impacts of being tolerated. Employing a robust methodology that combines survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments with EEG, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of intergroup toleration. The findings will not only advance theoretical knowledge in the social sciences but also offer practical insights for developing initiatives that promote a more inclusive and tolerant society. Given the current societal tensions and the lack of systematic research in this area, this study is both pioneering and timely, with the potential to significantly enhance our ability to navigate the complexities of cultural diversity."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",
