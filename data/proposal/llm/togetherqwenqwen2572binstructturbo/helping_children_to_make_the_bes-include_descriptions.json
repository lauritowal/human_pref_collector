        "Our ERC-team, funded by the ERC Consolidator Grant Social-Bio Interplay, has identified that negative social experiences with peers and teachers during elementary school can significantly impair children's self-regulation and stress management. These deficits often persist and exacerbate the challenges children face when transitioning to high school, leading to ongoing social difficulties. To address this critical issue, we propose the development of A.L.I.B.I., an innovative serious game designed to enhance children's self-regulation and prosocial behaviors, thereby facilitating a smoother transition to high school.\n\nA.L.I.B.I. places children in a virtual high school setting where they must uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer. Through engaging in prosocial interactions, taking the perspective of others, and learning to consider multiple response options, children will gather clues to identify the alien. This game provides a realistic yet safe environment for children to practice and develop essential social skills, preparing them for the new social dynamics they will encounter in high school.\n\nThe proposed ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant aims to: (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a fully functional, stand-alone serious game, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I. through rigorous testing, (3) integrate the game into existing school transition training programs provided by three school counseling organizations across three regions in the Netherlands, and (4) create a comprehensive marketing strategy to facilitate broader implementation in the Netherlands and Europe. This project promises to provide a valuable tool for educators and counselors, ultimately supporting children in navigating the challenging transition to high school with greater confidence and resilience."

The affected self- and stress-regulation places these children at risk of developing similar troublesome relations with teachers and peers after the transition to high school. We propose to develop a serious game named A.L.I.B.I. to help children make a successful transition to high school by increasing children’s self-regulation skills and their prosocial behavior. In A.L.I.B.I. children play in a virtual high school environment. The objective of A.L.I.B.I. is to uncover an alien, who is disguised as a teacher or peer. By engaging in prosocial interactions with teachers and peers, by taking the perspective of others, by learning to overthink multiple response options before acting, and by valuing long term perspectives over short term goals, children will receive clues that will help them to uncover the alien. The advantage of A.L.I.B.I. is that through the use of a virtual school environment, it provides children a realistic yet safe environment to learn and rehearse prosocial behaviors, to prepare them for the new social environment. In addition, A.L.I.B.I. is intuitively attractive for children, through its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer. The proposed ERC PoC grant has the goal to (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game that will be ready for implementation, (2) to the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I., (3) to integrate A.L.I.B.I. in ongoing school transition trainings as provided by three school counseling organizations in three regions in The Netherlands, and (4) to develop a marketing strategy for broader Dutch and European implementation.",
