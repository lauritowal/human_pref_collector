    "descriptions": [
        "Funding frictions, or the difficulties institutions face in securing or renewing credit, can precipitate financial instability, as seen during the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 market turmoil triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. These frictions can lead to the insolvency of otherwise solvent entities and pose systemic risks. This project aims to deepen our understanding of funding frictions and their impact on various sectors, including countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. It will explore how these frictions typically materialize through increased financing costs, shortened debt maturities, and restricted access to credit markets. Specifically, the research will analyze four key post-crisis developments: the rise in fiscal deficits in developed economies, the stricter regulation of Money Market Mutual Funds, the trend of pension risk transfers from firms to life insurance companies, and the implementation of tighter bank regulations under Basel III. By examining how these changes influence funding costs and credit market access, the study seeks to provide actionable insights for sovereign debt management and inform policymakers about the potential unintended consequences of regulatory reforms. This research will contribute to more resilient financial policies and institutions, better equipped to manage future crises."

In extreme situations, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) or the market turmoil in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, funding frictions can lead to the default of otherwise healthy institutions and destabilize the entire financial system. While earlier research (pre-GFC) tends to disregard funding frictions, the enormous risk associated with these market tensions highlights that a deeper understanding of funding frictions is crucial - it can guide policy makers to determine their optimal responses to future crises and help institutions to reduce their funding risk. In this project, I will investigate how funding frictions affect financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. While funding frictions can, in the most extreme cases, lead to the bankruptcy of otherwise healthy entities, they usually first manifest through elevated costs for external financing, shorter debt maturities, or a lack of access to certain credit markets. Focusing on these aspects, I will investigate the following question: How did the market developments since the GFC affect funding frictions for countries, banks, pension funds, and insurance companies? More specifically, I examine four post-crisis changes in financial markets - (i) ballooning deficits in most developed economies, (ii) tighter regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, (iii) pension risk transfers with firms transferring their defined benefit (DB) pension plans to life insurance companies, and (iv) tighter bank regulation (as implemented in the Basel III capital accords) - and study their impact on funding costs and access to credit markets. The results can help sovereigns with managing their increasing debt levels and inform policy makers about the (potentially unintended) consequences of regulatory changes.",
