        "This interdisciplinary research project seeks to enhance our understanding of human cognitive capabilities, particularly in the realm of processing and representing complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures, through an in-depth exploration of music perception. Comprising three main strands, the project builds on the Principal Investigator’s established work to address critical gaps in the current theoretical and empirical understanding of musical syntax.\n\nThe first strand, theoretical, aims to develop a novel and unified theory of musical syntax that transcends the limitations of existing models. By integrating principles from both Western and non-Western musical traditions, this strand will formulate a comprehensive framework that accounts for the intricate interplay between harmonic structure and voice leading, surpassing the context-free grammatical approaches that dominate the field.\n\nIn the computational strand, the project will address the scarcity of machine-readable resources by creating and disseminating a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses. This corpus will serve as a foundation for implementing the unified syntax theory through advanced parsing techniques and graph grammars, facilitating rigorous training and evaluation processes.\n\nFinally, the experimental strand will empirically test the theoretical predictions derived from the unified framework, focusing on key aspects such as nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, and tension resolution. The findings from this strand will provide crucial insights into the mental representations of musical structure and their cognitive underpinnings.\n\nBy advancing the theoretical, computational, and empirical dimensions of music cognition, this project will make a substantial contribution to the broader field of cognitive sciences, offering new perspectives on how humans process and understand complex auditory information."

The proposed project aims at advancing the understanding of human cognition and, specifically, the capacity to represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures by exploring the rich potential of music perception. Building on the PI’s previous work, this interdisciplinary research programme will be divided into three core strands: (A) The theoretical strand will be devoted to the investigation of formal principles that govern musical syntax and structure building in Western and non-Western music. Many current approaches share the expressive power of (tree-based) context-free grammars and are mostly confined to harmonic syntax only. Therefore, they face difficulty in expressing certain crucial syntactic phenomena in music. To address this lacuna, the theoretical strand will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity and reconciles harmonic structure with the constraints of voice leading within a single coherent framework. (B) Addressing the lack of machine-readable corpora in music research, a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses will be compiled and published in the context of the project’s computational strand. Further, the unified syntax theory will be implemented based on a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars, and trained and evaluated using the analytical corpus. (C) The formal framework developed in (A) entails specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure that will be empirically tested in the experimental strand of the project. Particular focus will be on aspects of nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. The outcomes of the project will make a significant contribution to both the field of music cognition and to the cognitive sciences in general.",
