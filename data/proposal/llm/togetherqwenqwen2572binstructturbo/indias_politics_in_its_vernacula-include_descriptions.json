        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the vernacular political concepts that underpin the everyday political engagement of ordinary Indian citizens, a critical yet under-researched area in the study of India's political life. Despite India's status as the world's largest democracy and a rising global power, the conceptual foundations of its political life remain largely uncharted, particularly when examined through indigenous lenses. This project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating anthropology, history, linguistics, and political science, to systematically investigate the vernacular languages of Indian politics. By conducting ethnographic and historical research, the team aims to (1) establish a comprehensive empirical and analytical foundation for a vernacular lexicography of India's political vocabulary; (2) create an online, open-access Concept Laboratory to document and disseminate these findings; and (3) collaborate with scholars of European political ideas to explore the broader implications for global political theory. Building on the Principal Investigator's extensive research on demotic categories and values in Indian politics, this project will not only fill a significant gap in the academic literature but also extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project to a non-European context, contributing to a more inclusive and globally grounded political theory."

Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.",
