        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe BACKWARD project aims to resolve longstanding debates in the phylogenetic relationships of African and Asian extinct hominids through the development and application of advanced palaeoproteomic workflows. While ancient DNA (aDNA) has significantly advanced our understanding of human evolution, migration, and admixture, its availability is limited to samples less than approximately 0.4 million years old. In contrast, ancient proteins can survive much longer, offering a unique opportunity to explore molecular-based phylogenies of species that have been extinct for millions of years. BACKWARD will leverage state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to:\n\n1. Clarify the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins, a topic of long-standing debate further complicated by recent discoveries.\n2. Investigate the hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia, another region with contentious and evolving interpretations.\n\nAdditionally, the project will screen large collections of morphologically non-informative fossil fragments to identify the species and sex of the organisms, providing crucial evolutionary context for understanding human brain expansion and reorganization. The methodologies developed will have broader applications, including forensic medicine, food, and pharmaceutical diagnostics. By integrating the unique expertise of each participating institution, BACKWARD aims to revolutionize palaeoanthropology, palaeontology, palaeoecology, and archaeology, much as aDNA did over the past two decades."

Ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing revolutionised our knowledge on evolution, migration and admixture of archaic and anatomically modern humans. However, no hominid aDNA older than ~0.4 million years has been retrieved yet. Ancient proteins instead survive much longer than aDNA, enabling molecular-based phylogeny beyond the limits of aDNA degradation. Recently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based ancient protein sequencing, i.e. palaeoproteomics, convincingly demonstrated its transformative value, enabling molecular-based evolutionary reconstructions for species that went extinct millions of years ago. BACKWARD will use palaeoproteomics to address: (i) the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins, and (ii) the hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia; two topics debated for generations, and further complicated by recent finds. This knowledge will also provide the evolutionary scaffolding needed to correctly identify and correlate the series of processes that defined human brain expansion and reorganization. BACKWARD will also screen large sets of morphologically non-informative isolated fossil fragments of bones and teeth, to identify the species and sex of the organism from which they originated. Some of these solutions will be commercially re-purposed to deliver superior performance in public and private analytic laboratories for diagnostics in forensic medicine, and in the food or pharmaceutical industry. As a key BACKWARD feature, the unique contribution provided by each participating institution will be integrated in a strong partnership to transform palaeoanthropology, palaeontology, palaeoecology and archaeology once again, as aDNA did over the last twenty years.",
