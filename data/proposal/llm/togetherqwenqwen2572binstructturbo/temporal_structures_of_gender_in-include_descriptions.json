        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, titled \"GenTime: Gender Inequality in Time Use Across East Asian and Western Societies,\" aims to expand the sociological understanding of welfare regimes and gender roles beyond the Western-centric models that have historically dominated the field. By integrating newly available data from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, this study will explore the unique patterns and trajectories of gender inequality in time use within East Asian welfare regimes. GenTime will investigate the systematic differences in the amount of time men and women spend on daily activities, including unpaid work, and how these differences are influenced by public policies and the provision of modern technology in care and domestic labor. The project will analyze high-quality cross-national and historical comparative time diary and household panel data to examine the gender division of labor at both the household and societal levels. Additionally, it will consider the life course perspective, assessing the long-term impacts of time use on family outcomes. Through this comprehensive approach, GenTime seeks to establish whether East Asian welfare regimes constitute a distinct typology, thereby contributing to a more global and nuanced understanding of gender inequality and social policy."

But these worlds, and later developments in this field, including the extension and application of the framework to gender roles, derive exclusively from Western models. What will emerge as we seek to develop a global perspective on other models of welfare regimes and how they handle gender inequalities? We will answer this question, using newly available data deriving from beyond the conventional Anglophone and European theatres: from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to explore patterns emerging from other cultural and social traditions. GenTime will be a study of gender inequality in patterns of time use across East Asian and Western societies. We will investigate the development trajectories and provision of unpaid work in different welfare regimes, and the systematic differences between men and women in the amount of time they spend on daily activities and their daily life schedules. It will examine time use as an important parameter of public policies. We will establish if East Asian regimes represent a distinct typology. The project will shed new light on the gender division of labour and social inequality across different regime types. Furthermore, we will examine how the use of modern technology in care provision and domestic labour may shape the trends in gender inequality. We will investigate the impacts on gender differences in leisure time and enjoyment in daily activities. High quality cross-national and historical comparative time diary data and household panel data will be analysed to study gender inequality 1) at the household level on how couples divide their roles in work and family; 2) at the societal level on the role of welfare regimes in shaping the trends in domestic division of labour; and 3) from a life course perspective on the impacts of time use on later family outcomes.",
