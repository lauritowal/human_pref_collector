        "This grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the economics of information services by examining the strategic interactions among agents involved in the production and exchange of such services. The central focus is on the role of externalities, which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the nature of information services. These externalities are driven by three key factors: the presence of one-sided and two-sided network effects, the public good characteristics of information, and the complementarity between information services and physical infrastructures.\n\nThe proposal is structured into four main components. The first part develops the theoretical foundation, integrating concepts from two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities, using innovative methods such as global games and coordination games. The second part delves into the virtual layer of information services, addressing issues like recommendation systems, privacy concerns, and transaction costs, with empirical analysis of e-commerce platform data. The third part investigates the physical infrastructure layer, exploring topics such as net neutrality, pricing strategies, and dynamic investment models, considering the interplay between infrastructure and service innovation. Finally, the fourth part aims to develop policy tools for competition in two-sided markets, providing practical guidance for regulators.\n\nThis comprehensive approach will contribute to a deeper understanding of the economic dynamics in the information society, informing both theoretical advancements and practical policy decisions."

In this context, externalities play a key role explored by this proposal. Their increasing prevalence in information services can be traced to three features: - Many information services involve one-sided or two-sided network externalities. - Information is a public good and the production and exchange of information between two parties may affect other parties in a positive or negative manner. - Information services and physical infrastructures are complements. Externalities arise in the two layers of the information society, the content level and the physical infrastructure. The proposal is then organized around four parts: 1. Background theory: two-sided markets, network dynamics, contractual externalities 2. Virtual layer: recommendation systems, privacy, transaction costs 3. Physical layer: pricing , investment 4. Competition policy for two-sided markets The first part consists of the development of relevant theory with original and novel methods including for instance global games, coordination games and recent contract theory. The second part studies specific issues in information services such as the design of search engines and the right to privacy. It also includes empirical investigation of on-line transaction costs using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms. The third part is concerned with the infrastructure. It studies net-neutrality and the prices of data from the perspective of price theory, accounting for the gratuity of some services. It will also develop original dynamic investment models to understand the role of the complementarity between infrastructure and service innovation and the role of legacy. The last part will develop tools for competition policy makers.",
