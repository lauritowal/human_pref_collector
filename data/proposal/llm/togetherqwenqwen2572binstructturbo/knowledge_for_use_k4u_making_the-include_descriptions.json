    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe K4U initiative seeks to revolutionize the application of social science in formulating effective and ethically grounded social policies. Despite significant advancements in research, a critical gap remains in translating this knowledge into practical, actionable policies. K4U addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that redefines the role of social science in policy-making. Through a rigorous philosophical investigation, K4U will reconceptualize key aspects such as objectivity, deliberation, and the integration of values in the science-society interface. Unlike existing efforts that focus primarily on knowledge production, K4U emphasizes the practical use of social science, providing policymakers with a clear, actionable guide to leverage research for better policy outcomes. This includes methods for assessing the effectiveness, evidence, and social acceptability of proposed policies, as well as strategies for balancing competing interests and values. Grounded in a Popperian philosophy, K4U emphasizes concrete, detailed applications of theoretical concepts, ensuring that the framework is both intelligible and useful for stakeholders. By doing so, K4U aims to establish a new field in philosophy—the philosophy of social technology—dedicated to making a tangible difference in real-world policy-making."

That’s only true if you know what to do with it. When it comes to social policy, we don’t really know how to put our research results to use. K4U aims to remedy this. K4U will construct a radically new picture of how to use social science to build better social policies. This picture will be founded on an ambitious philosophical study of the technology of social science including a thorough reconceptualisation of objectivity, deliberation and the role of values in the science/society interface. Current work, primarily by the evidence-based policy and practice movement, focusses on knowledge production: encouraging high quality studies and vetting them. Little attention goes to knowledge use: How is social science knowledge to be used in policy design and deliberation – how should it be used so that policy outcomes are more effective and more reliably predictable and competing values and points of view are respected in policy choice and implementation? K4U will provide not just a theoretical but a practical understanding— for users: intelligible and practically helpful to those who need to estimate and balance the effectiveness, the evidence, the chances of success, the costs, the benefits, the winners and losers, and the social, moral, political and cultural acceptability of proposed policies. The philosophical approach of K4U is broadly Popperian. It views ‘science and technology as a means of understanding social problems and responding to them’ and it emphasises the concrete and detailed, where the real content of general philosophical concepts and claims is embodied and interrogated. K4U is a showcase for the kind of philosophy that makes a difference to real life -- philosophy for practice. And it will launch an entire new field in philosophy: the philosophy of social technology.",
