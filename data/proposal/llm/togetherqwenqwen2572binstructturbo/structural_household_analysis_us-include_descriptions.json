        "This project aims to develop a robust toolkit for the empirical analysis of household consumption by focusing on the individual preferences and interactions within households. Unlike traditional models that treat households as single decision-making units, this research recognizes the complexity of household dynamics and the influence of individual members. The primary innovation lies in the development of a nonparametric revealed preference methodology, which leverages the consumption choices observed at the household level to infer individual preferences and intrahousehold interactions. This approach avoids the common pitfall of imposing nonverifiable functional structures on the decision-making process, thereby providing a more accurate and flexible framework for analysis.\n\nThe project makes two significant contributions. First, at the theoretical level, it integrates the dynamics of the marriage market into the structural modeling of household consumption. By considering the \"outside options\" available to household members, such as the potential for alternative partnerships, the model provides a more nuanced understanding of bargaining positions and their impact on consumption decisions. Second, at the empirical level, the project combines revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation techniques to analyze demand systems. This integration enhances the applicability of the methodology to cross-sectional data sets, addressing issues like unobserved heterogeneity and the limitations of revealed preference tests. These advancements will significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of household consumption analysis, offering valuable insights for policy and economic research."

Understanding this consumption behavior requires non-unitary modeling of households, which recognizes that households are not single decision units but consist of interacting individuals. This project builds a powerful toolkit for empirical analysis of household consumption through structural models of individual preferences and within-household interactions. It opens the “intrahousehold black box” while only using the (limited) consumption information observed at the aggregate household level. In particular, I develop a revealed preference methodology that is intrinsically nonparametric. This method (only) uses preference information that is directly revealed by the observed consumption choices. It avoids confounding the analysis by imposing (nonverifiable) parametric/functional structure on within-household decision processes. My main contribution is twofold: 1. At the theoretical level, I integrate marriage market dynamics into the structural modeling of household consumption. The marriage market defines the “outside options” of (adult) household members, which indirectly impacts the intrahousehold consumption allocation (e.g. through individual bargaining positions). Modeling these marriage market effects implies a better description of the intrahousehold decision process, which in turn yields a more powerful analysis of household consumption. 2. At the empirical level, I integrate revealed preference restrictions on non-unitary household consumption with nonparametric estimation of demand systems (subject to non-unitary shape restrictions on household demand). This will enhance the applicability of revealed preference methods to widely available (pooled) cross-section data sets. It also allows for addressing empirical issues such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and limited power of revealed preference restrictions.",
