        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project aims to revolutionize our understanding of working memory (WM) by integrating it with the dynamic interaction between internal cognitive processes and the external environment. Traditional theories of WM focus on the limited capacity of internal storage, often in contexts where the remembered information is no longer physically present. However, in real-world scenarios, the external world remains accessible, and the brain must efficiently balance internal storage with external sampling. HOMEOSTASIS proposes a novel theoretical framework where WM operates within an internal mental economy, maintaining perceptual homeostasis by dynamically adjusting the trade-off between the costs of accurate internal storage and the benefits of external sampling. This project will challenge the conventional focus on WM's maximum capacity by hypothesizing that observers often minimize internal storage due to its cognitive effort. To test this model, we will develop and employ innovative experimental paradigms that study WM in interaction with the physically present environment. Advanced electroencephalographic decoding techniques will be used to decode the current content of WM, while virtual reality technology will allow us to manipulate the reliability and familiarity of the external environment. Additionally, we will examine patients with specific WM deficits to validate the model's components and use machine learning to identify biometric signatures in eye movements. This research will not only advance our theoretical understanding of WM but also have practical implications for diagnosing WM disorders and optimizing interactions with computer-manipulated virtual environments in an increasingly digital world."

WM is therefore generally referred to as a limited-capacity system. This limitation is not a problem in daily life, however, because the external world typically remains available and can be accessed relatively easily. The current dominant theory of WM does not explain how the brain balances between internal storage and external sampling, as this theory exclusively relates to situations in which the remembered information is no longer physically present. The HOMEOSTASIS project is motivated by the idea that WM should be studied in interaction with the world that is still within view. HOMEOSTASIS will develop a new theoretical model of WM based on an internal mental economy: I propose that WM maintains a perceptual homeostasis by dynamically trading the costs of accurate internal storage against external sampling of the external visual world. Whereas current research on WM has a strong focus on its maximum capacity, this capacity may hardly be used as observers prefer to minimize internal storage due to the effortful nature of WM storage. I will rigorously test the modelâ€™s theoretical basis using novel experimental paradigms in which WM is studied in interaction with the physically present environment. To decode the current content of WM, I will adopt state-of-the-art electroencephalographic decoding techniques. To study WM in interaction with worlds of varying reliability and familiarity, I will employ virtual reality technology. Finally, I will investigate patients with restricted deficits to specific components of the model and use machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements. This new model of WM will open a new window to diagnose WM disorders and for understanding how we interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments in an increasingly computer-dominated world.",
