        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Performativity in Models: Analysis and Philosophical Synthesis\" (P-MAPS) aims to explore the multifaceted role of scientific models in shaping social realities, particularly in fields such as economics, epidemiology, and machine learning. These models, through their predictive and explanatory capabilities, often influence policy decisions and individual behaviors, thereby performing the very phenomena they aim to model. This performativity introduces significant challenges to the traditional roles of science, as it can alter the outcomes of predictions and raise ethical concerns about the legitimacy of scientific guidance in societal affairs.\n\nP-MAPS will address these challenges by pursuing three core objectives. First, it will develop a comprehensive framework for understanding performativity, grounded in empirical studies of scientific practice. This framework will elucidate the mechanisms through which models influence social outcomes and the conditions under which such influence occurs. Second, the project will critically examine the interplay between the epistemic and performative functions of scientific models, assessing the ethical implications of performativity, including the potential for manipulation and the impact on democratic processes. Finally, P-MAPS will provide actionable guidelines for both philosophers and practitioners, enabling them to evaluate and manage the performative aspects of scientific models effectively.\n\nBy bridging the gap between scientific practice and philosophical analysis, P-MAPS aims to establish performativity management as a critical area of study, offering a robust foundation for the ethical and responsible use of scientific models in shaping societal policies and behaviors."

Especially in the social realm, they can also influence their targets – a capacity that is called “performativity”. By influencing policy making and individual behavior, models from economics, epidemiology, or machine learning increasingly perform the social world in significant ways. This development should be of utmost importance to philosophers, for two reasons: First, performativity can impair scientific prediction and explanation. If, for instance, a model of the spread of COVID-19 predicts many deaths, people might reduce their social contacts in response, which may in turn lead to the predicted events not coming about! How should we evaluate such a prediction, and how should scientists deal with these effects? Second, the development raises difficult ethical questions about the legitimacy of science guiding human affairs, and the values that are implicit in this process. Should we welcome science’s increasingly practical role in shaping policy-making and individual behavior? Or should we regard such influence as manipulative, potentially undermining democratic decision making? These are difficult philosophical questions, but they also have significant practical import. Yet the philosophy of science hasn’t so far provided guidance on how performative science might be evaluated and managed. MAPS will close this lacuna. The core aims of the project are: (1) to develop a novel understanding of what performativity is and can do, by closely following scientific practice; (2) to understand the intricate relationship between science’s epistemic and performative roles, and to assess the ethical risks of performativity; and (3) to provide orientation to philosophers and practitioners for how to assess and manage performative science. By integrating insights from scientific practice with philosophical assessment, the project will establish performativity management as a central theme of philosophical inquiry.",
