    "descriptions": [
        "This research proposal aims to explore the evolving nature of musical performance practices in the context of the transition from a text-centric to a performance-centric culture. Specifically, the project seeks to (a) assess the historical and cultural specificity of traditional musical interpretation, (b) develop innovative performance practices through experimental methodologies, and (c) evaluate the applicability of scientific experimentation models to musical performance. By engaging in material artistic practices, the research team will produce concrete artistic outputs that serve as both a means of inquiry and a vehicle for disseminating new knowledge. This approach emphasizes the role of music as a methodological tool for generating and communicating theoretical insights, fostering innovation in both academic and performance spheres. The project will offer concrete examples of alternative performance approaches, positioning itself at the forefront of Artistic Research. Situated at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, the project will leverage and enhance the ongoing discourse on Artistic Experimentation, contributing to a more dynamic and diverse understanding of musical performance. Through a combination of theoretical exploration and practical application, this initiative seeks to redefine the concept of interpretation in music, offering a tangible and audible alternative to conventional practices."

Do not include information not available in the description below.

The aim of this research proposal is to investigate: (a) the extent to which the traditional conception of musical interpretation is bound to a given historical period; (b) how new investigative paths can be created through experimental performance practices; and (c) the extent to which the scientific model of the practice of experimentation is transferable to music performance. Crucial to these objectives is the material engagement in artistic practice, including the generation of concrete artistic outputs by the PI and other team members. The practice of music – understood as a fundamental methodological tool for the generation and exposition of new knowledge, will contribute decisively to innovations in both theory and practice, opening up opportunities for both scholarship and future performance practices. While exploring alternative approaches to music performance, this project will deliver concrete examples of such possibilities, situating itself at the frontline of the burgeoning field of Artistic Research. Combining theoretical investigation with the concrete practice of music, this project presents a case for change in the field of musical performance. Alongside critical reflection on the state-of-the-art, it proposes a graspable and ‘audible’ alternative to traditional understandings of ‘interpretation’ in musical performance. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, it will benefit from, and contribute to, the wider discourse on Artistic Experimentation, the Centre's current research focus.",
