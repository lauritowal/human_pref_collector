    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to develop a unified framework that integrates the study of business cycles and long-term productivity growth within a Keynesian growth model. Traditionally, these areas have been studied in isolation, despite their evident interplay in economic policy, particularly evident since the Great Recession. The proposed research will be divided into three parts. In the first part, a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms will be constructed, drawing on the insights from endogenous growth theory. This model will explore how changes in aggregate demand affect business cycles and productivity growth, the role of monetary and fiscal policies in productivity, and the potential for pessimistic expectations to lead to economic stagnation. The second part will extend this framework to an open economy setting, examining how monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth interact, with a specific focus on the European Union and the effects of the euro's introduction on capital flows and productivity. Finally, the third part will empirically test the core hypothesis of the Keynesian growth framework, analyzing the response of productivity growth to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions in the United States and other advanced economies. This research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between economic fluctuations and productivity, offering valuable insights for policymakers."

Yet, the interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth and stabilization policies are well present in the policy debate, especially since the start of the Great Recession. In this proposal, I will develop a Keynesian growth framework to study business cycles and growth in a unified theory. The framework combines the Keynesian insight that fluctuations might be driven by changes in aggregate demand, with the notion, developed by the endogenous growth literature, that productivity growth is the result of firmsâ€™ investment in innovation. In part I, I will develop a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms, in the spirit of the state-of-the-art quantitative endogenous growth literature. I will use the framework to study the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on productivity growth; to understand the behavior of productivity during large recessions triggered by financial crises, such as the recent Great Recession; and to investigate the possibility that pessimistic expectations might give rise to periods of stagnation. In part II, I will provide an open economy Keynesian growth model, able to capture the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows and productivity growth. I will use the framework to explain why the inception of the euro was associated with a sharp increase in capital flows across its member countries, and with stagnant productivity growth in countries recipients of capital inflows. In part III, I will test the hypothesis, at the heart of the Keynesian growth framework, that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and to monetary and fiscal policy interventions. To this end, I will estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to policy and business cycle shocks, both in the United States and in a panel of advanced economies.",
