        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe sustainable management of ecosystem services (ES) is crucial for human well-being in the 21st century. Despite this, accurate data on the distribution of most ES remains scarce, particularly in regions where such information is most needed. Existing methods for mapping ES often rely on proxies, which have been shown to be unreliable, especially when assessing policy-relevant trade-offs and synergies. The SCALEFORES project aims to address this challenge by developing and validating a novel methodological framework that leverages the scale-dependency of relationships between ES and their underlying social and ecological drivers. This framework will enable the creation of accurate, high-resolution maps of ES relationships in previously unmapped areas. By systematically analyzing how these relationships vary across different scales, SCALEFORES will enhance our ability to map both the trade-offs and win-wins between multiple ES. The methodology will be rigorously tested and validated using existing ES data from Europe, the region with the most comprehensive ES datasets globally. This project has the potential to significantly advance the field of ecosystem service mapping, providing robust tools for multifunctional, ES-based landscape management."

However, at present there is little data on the distribution of most services in most places. To date, the discipline of ecosystem service mapping has tried overcome this lack of data by using proxies to map ecosystem services based on our perceived understanding of ecosystem services from small-scale studies. However, the most commonly used proxies have been shown to be inaccurate, particularly for understanding policy-relevant trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The challenge therefore remains - how do we reliably map such relationships between multiple ES, thereby enabling multifunctional, ES-based management of our landscapes? In the SCALEFORES project, I will address this challenge head-on by developing and testing a novel methodological framework that enables the use of existing data to produce accurate maps of the relationships between ES in previously unmapped regions. The overarching idea underpinning SCALEFORES is that we can use information on the scale-dependency of relationships between existing social and ecological datasets (e.g. land cover, soil type, human population density) to create maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The SCALEFORES project will systematically examine the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and the social and ecological variables that underpin them. It will then use this knowledge to enable a step change increase in our ability to accurately map both relationships between ES and the distributions of ecosystem services themselves. The methodology developed in SCALEFORES will be validated against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe, as this is the region with the best data on ecosystem services globally.",
