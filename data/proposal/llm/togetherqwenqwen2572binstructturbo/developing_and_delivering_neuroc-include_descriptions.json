        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis ERC Advanced Grant proposal seeks to advance the field of cognitive-clinical neuroscience by developing and integrating innovative methods and tools to bridge the gap between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. While experimental psychology and behavioral neurology have provided valuable insights into complex mental behaviors and their underlying cognitive processes, and in vivo neuroimaging has enabled detailed mapping of neural systems, a systematic approach to integrate these findings remains elusive. The project will focus on two core activities: (1) the convergence of methods, where cognitive and neuroscientific techniques will be employed concurrently to ensure a unified and comprehensive understanding of brain-cognition relationships; and (2) the development of a novel neurocomputational model that explicitly links cognitive processes with systems-level neuroanatomy and function. By retaining the capacity to simulate detailed cognitive behavior while aligning the computational architecture with known neural systems, this model will offer a powerful new framework for understanding both normal and impaired cognitive functions. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust foundation for the clinical management and treatment of neurological disorders, thereby advancing both the scientific understanding of mental processes and their practical applications in healthcare."

This is crucial, scientifically, if we are to understand the nature of mental processes and how they arise from neural machinery but also, clinically, if we are to establish the basis of neurological patients’ impairments, their clinical management and treatment. Cognitive-clinical neuroscience depends on three ingredients: (a) investigating complex mental behaviours and the underlying cognitive processes; (b) mapping neural systems and their function; and (c) methods and tools that can bridge the gap between brain and mental behaviour. Experimental psychology and behavioural neurology has delivered the first component. In vivo neuroimaging and other allied technologies allow us to probe and map neural systems, their connectivity and neurobiological responses. The principal aim of this ERC Advanced grant is to secure, for the first time, the crucial third ingredient – the methods and tools for bridging systematically between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. The grant will be based on two main activities: (i) convergence of methods – instead of employing each neuroscience and cognitive method independently, they will be planned and executed simultaneously to force a convergence of results; and (ii) development of a new type of neurocomputational model - to provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. Computational models are used in cognitive science to mimic normal and impaired behaviour. Such models also have an as-yet untapped potential to connect neuroanatomy and cognition: latent in every model is a kind of brain-mind duality – each model is based on a computational architecture which generates behaviour. We will retain the ability to simulate detailed cognitive behaviour but simultaneously make the models’ architecture reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function.",
