        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe LostMa project seeks to explore the mechanisms of cultural evolution, focusing on the transmission of written cultural artifacts. By examining the processes of copying, transformation, and destruction of texts in manuscript form, LostMa aims to determine the extent to which the preservation or loss of these artifacts deviates from random chance. This investigation will draw parallels with the evolutionary processes of living organisms and language variants, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates artificial intelligence, complexity science, and traditional philological methods. Specifically, the project will utilize stochastic birth-and-death models and computer simulations to mimic the dynamics of textual transmission. A case study on chivalric literature in the European context will be conducted, involving a large-scale data collection from a corpus of 4,000 documents in Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, with a detailed analysis of approximately 1,000 Old French manuscripts. The data collected will be used to validate simulation outcomes, estimate unobservable parameters like loss and survival rates, and uncover the underlying dynamics that influence the transmission of cultural texts. This project seeks to challenge existing paradigms in the humanities by introducing a quantitative and computational framework to understand the cultural transmission process."

It strives to establish in what measure the transmission (and subsequent preservation or loss) of written artefacts, texts and ideas deviates from pure chance, and, if it deviates, by how much and why it does. It will do so by analysing the way that texts in manuscript form were copied, transformed or destroyed, in a similar way to the evolution of living organisms or of language variants, through process of innovation/mutation, fixation or extinction. As such, the goal of this project is not only to understand the processes behind the transmission of texts, but also to grasp the extent to which humans are the actors of the transmission of their own culture and how much the survival of texts or the constitution of cultural canons are due to chance. If this notion may seem provocative to humanities researchers, evolutionary biologists have long discovered the role of random drift in the survival or extinction of genetic traits and species. To investigate this question, this project will attempt a paradigm-shift in philological methods, by combining artificial intelligence, complexity science and philological expertise. Stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations will be used to emulate the process of textual transmission. A case study will be taken, regarding chivalric literature in European context. Supported by deep learning methods, large-scale data collection will be made on a corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic and Celtic languages, with a full-text zoom on approx. 1000 Old French manuscripts. Data will provide observable values to be compared to simulation results, in order to measure deviations from chance, make inferences on non observable values such as loss/survival rates of works and manuscripts, and understand the dynamics at work behind the transmission of texts.",
