        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe MICROCODE project seeks to explore the pivotal role of public opinion in the adherence to collective defense commitments within military alliances. Despite the critical importance of these alliances, existing research has not fully elucidated how public sentiment influences decisions to honor defense commitments. This project will introduce a novel research agenda that investigates the microfoundations of collective defense, focusing on public opinion as a central factor. Utilating advanced methodologies from experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, we will conduct a comprehensive, cross-national study in key NATO member states. Our research will develop a sophisticated theoretical framework to analyze (1) the processes by which individuals form attitudes toward allied assistance in diverse defense scenarios, (2) the mechanisms through which these individual attitudes coalesce into broader public opinion, and (3) the extent to which public opinion impacts the decision-making of policymakers. We hypothesize that the strategic context significantly affects the formation and influence of public opinion, with \"grey zone\" conflicts—characterized by ambiguity and complexity—creating a wider \"contestation space\" where public views are more polarized and malleable. To test these hypotheses, we will employ innovative immersive mixed-media experiments, providing participants with realistic and interactive scenarios to observe their responses under various conditions. The findings from the MICROCODE project have the potential to fundamentally reshape our understanding of the stability and reliability of military alliances in an increasingly unstable global security landscape."

The historical record shows that allied states often do not honour their collective defence commitments, but existing scholarship has not yet explained the role of public views in these high-stakes decisions. The MICROCODE project aims to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence that puts public opinion in allied countries at the centre of inquiry. Building on cutting-edge approaches in experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, I aim to conduct an extensive, cross-national investigation in the key NATO member states, with the views of individuals as the principal unit of analysis. I introduce a complex theoretical model to explain (1) how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios; (2) how these individual attitudes aggregate to form public opinion shaped by societal cues; and (3) how, in turn, public opinion shapes the views of decision-makers in allied states. My main set of hypotheses concerns the critical impact of the strategic context on the formation of public opinion and its relevance for policy-making: I propose that whereas conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression leave a limited role for public opinion, the more ambiguous “grey zone” conflicts potentially open a wide “contestation space” where public views become more polarised, elastic, and simultaneously more relevant for decision-makers. As a methodological innovation, I will use novel immersive mixed-media experiments to create an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for the participants and examine how their attitudes towards defending allies change under different conditions. At a time of dramatic deterioration of the international security environment, the MICROCODE project’s findings could redefine how we view the stability and credibility of military alliances.",
