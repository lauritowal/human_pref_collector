        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to advance the assessment of the economic and health impacts of air pollution and climate change in Europe, with a focus on the combustion of fossil fuels. By developing innovative empirical models that enhance spatial resolution in economic impact analysis, we will provide a more detailed understanding of the trade-offs between environmental regulation and economic activities. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates causal inference on pollution emissions at their source with advanced chemical transport models, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of air pollutants. Additionally, we will incorporate subclinical and long-term health effects of air pollution into economic damage estimates, ensuring a more holistic evaluation of environmental impacts. The project is divided into two parts: the first examines the unintended economic consequences of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme on local air quality, while the second assesses the effects of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration patterns. By generating robust empirical evidence, this project seeks to inform and enhance environmental policy-making, contributing to more effective climate and air quality management strategies. The project's focus on policy-relevant outcomes and its potential for significant global impact make it a critical endeavor in the ongoing efforts to address environmental challenges."

Notwithstanding such improvements, environmental regulation continues to be a top priority for policy makers in Europe and other post-industrial societies. Global climate change is an important reason for this. Increasing demand for environmental quality is another one, explaining why some of the richest agglomerations in Europe have been adopting very costly measures to further reduce air pollution. Both global climate change and regional air pollution originate to a large extent from the combustion of fossil fuels, an activity that, in Europe, is costly to curb but also causes substantial damage to human health. This project contributes new tools for assessing this trade-off by (i) developing empirical models that greatly enhance spatial detail in state-of-the-art economic impact analysis, (ii) pioneering an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions at the source to chemical transport models for air pollutants, and (iii) incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts of air pollution into economic damage estimates. Part I of the project studies the economic implications of changes in local air quality that were an unintended consequence of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide. Part II analyzes the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration in a unified empirical framework. The key objective of this project is to provide empirical evidence that can inform environmental policy-making in the broad contexts of climate policy and air quality management. Given the ambitious concepts proposed, the global significance of the environmental problems addressed, and the focus on policy, this project has the potential to make a large impact.",
