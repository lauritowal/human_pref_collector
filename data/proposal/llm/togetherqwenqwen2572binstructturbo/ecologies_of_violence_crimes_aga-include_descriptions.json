        "The project \"EcoViolence\" seeks to explore the cultural responses to environmental destruction and the ethical questions it raises. By examining the artistic and literary representations of ecological violence, this initiative aims to bridge the gaps between cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, creating a novel framework for understanding the interconnections between human and non-human suffering. Our study will be the first to comprehensively analyze how writers, artists, and filmmakers from diverse global contexts adapt historical repertoires—originally developed to address atrocities like the Holocaust and slavery—to articulate the complexities of environmental violence. We will document and analyze the ways in which these cultural artifacts link environmental degradation to colonialism and genocide, while also exploring how they engage with emotions and affect to foster critical self-reflection and a sense of responsibility. Through this interdisciplinary approach, \"EcoViolence\" will not only contribute to the scholarly discourse but also produce a practical guide for educators, offering strategies to use cultural representations in teaching to enhance critical literacies and encourage nuanced discussions about the environmental crisis. This project aims to challenge the oversimplified narratives that have hindered effective responses to ecocide, promoting a more informed and empathetic engagement with the urgent issues of our time."

How do we remember the victims, both human and non-human? And who is to blame? Contemporary culture plays a crucial role in addressing these questions. Large-scale processes like ecocide and extinction pose significant conceptual and representational challenges. This project posits that writers, artists and filmmakers are responding to these challenges by adapting existing repertoires, especially ones that emerged in response to the Holocaust, slavery, and other atrocities. In so doing they reveal the historical, structural and discursive links between crimes against humanity and crimes against nature. EcoViolence will be the first comprehensive, transnational, comparative study of the cultural imaginary of environmental violence. Bringing together recent work in cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will develop an innovative ecological model for the study of violence and its representation. We will document how texts, films, art works, plays and exhibitions represent ecoviolence; map how they link it to colonialism and genocide; and analyse how they reflect on questions of guilt and responsibility, as well as culture’s own implication in the violence it depicts. Furthermore, we will explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to help people relate to the environmental crisis and promote critical self-reflection. EcoViolence will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research and ecocriticism by providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms. The project will result in a “best practices” guide to engage cultural representations in pedagogy to enhance critical literacies about ecoviolence and move beyond simplistic stories where everyone is either a victim or a perpetrator that have stifled full responses to our collective ecocidal trajectories.",
