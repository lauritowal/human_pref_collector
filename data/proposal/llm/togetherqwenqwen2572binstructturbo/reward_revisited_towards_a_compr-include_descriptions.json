    "title": "Reward revisited: Towards a comprehensive understanding of motivational influences on human cognition",
    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nMotivation stands as a cornerstone in psychological research, deeply intertwined with cognitive functions and clinical conditions. Recent studies highlight the impact of extrinsic rewards on cognitive processes such as conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. These cognitive functions are often impaired in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease. These disorders are associated with disruptions in the dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems, which are crucial for the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals. Despite the critical role of these systems, our understanding of how reward influences specific cognitive operations remains limited. This proposal aims to develop a comprehensive conceptual and neural framework elucidating the effects of reward on human cognition. We will integrate factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control and response modes, and the impact of irrelevant information to enhance our theoretical understanding. To investigate the underlying neural mechanisms, we will employ advanced neuroimaging techniques that provide reliable, non-invasive insights into the activity of DA and NA systems. The findings will contribute significantly to both fundamental and applied research in psychology and neuroscience, offering new perspectives on the role of motivation in both healthy and pathological contexts."

Beyond globally energizing behavior, recent studies have begun to describe effects of extrinsic reward on various specific cognitive operations like conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. Intriguingly, these functions appear to be disturbed in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease. On the neural level, these disorders have been related to disturbances in the dopaminergic (DA) and/or the noradrenergic (NA) system, which are the very same systems that are also thought to be vital for the cognitive benefits of reward observed in the healthy mind. Despite this central, probably interrelated, role in the healthy and the diseased mind, our understanding of how exactly reward impacts specific cognitive operations is still rudimentary, both on the level of psychological theory as well as concerning the underlying neural mechanisms. The aim of this proposal is to develop a novel unifying conceptual and neural framework of how reward influences human cognition. To achieve this goal, it is essential to extend our conceptual understanding of the nature of such reward effects by integrating additional interrelated factors, such as stimulus saliency, different cognitive-control and response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. In order to match this conceptual progress at the neuromechanistic level, it is critical to employ optimized neuroimaging methods that allow for a reliable, yet non-invasive investigation of neural activity in the source and target regions of the DA and NA system. Given the critical role of motivation in the healthy and the diseased mind, the results will provide new valuable insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research.",
