        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the influence of gut microbiota on human brain function and behavior, focusing specifically on the role of Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA). Current evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome, which is highly individualized, may produce neurotransmitters like GABA, a key inhibitor in the central nervous system. However, the direct impact of gut-derived GABA on brain chemistry and function remains unclear. This project will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating biochemical, psychological, and neuroscientific methods to address this knowledge gap.\n\nThe project is divided into two main work packages. The first will examine the correlation between the presence of GABA-producing bacteria in the gut and brain GABA levels, as measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), alongside performance in cognitive tasks known to depend on GABAergic activity. The second work package will investigate the effects of a four-week probiotic intervention, containing bacteria known to produce GABA, on the same neurobehavioral measures. By systematically assessing the relationship between gut microbiota, brain GABA levels, and cognitive performance, this research aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences brain function. This study not only has the potential to uncover novel pathways in neurobiology but also to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders."

It seems striking therefore, that 1% of this genetic difference accounts for the large extent of individual variations seen in human behaviour and brain function. One promising alternative source of individual differences is the resident bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, which is 40-90% distinct between different individuals. Bacteria in the human gut outnumber human cells, and account for nearly 10 times as much DNA as that from human cells. Some gut bacteria have been shown to produce Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT), molecules that function as neurotransmitters in the human brain. However, it is not known whether their production in the gut has any impact on behavioural and brain function. This project takes a biochemically informed approach to address this gap in knowledge through focussing on GABA, whose function as a neurotransmitter is well characterised, and which can be assayed directly or through proxy measures of brain and behaviour. The first work package of this project in human adults will investigate whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA can modulate brain levels of GABA (measured directly using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), as well as performance in tasks that depend on GABA-ergic activity. The second work package will test the impact of ingesting bacteria known to produce GABA (packaged as a custom-made probiotic) over a period of four weeks, on the same brain and behavioural measures. Together, these studies will answer a fundamental question of whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA, as well as its modulation by probiotics, has any impact on the level GABA in the brain and its function. This interdisciplinary proposal brings together approaches from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to chart a new research frontier in understanding individual differences in human behaviour and brain function.",
