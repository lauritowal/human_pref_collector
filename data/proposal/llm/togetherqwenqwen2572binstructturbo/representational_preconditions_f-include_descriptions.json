        "The proposed research project seeks to delve into the empirical foundations of a groundbreaking theoretical framework concerning the early representational preconditions and functional architecture of mechanisms involved in understanding other minds. This study aims to illuminate the fundamental cognitive and neural underpinnings of human social cognition, particularly focusing on the mechanisms that enable the representation of others' mental states. Contrary to traditional theories that posit these abilities as effortful and late-developing, our research advances a novel perspective: that mental state representation is primarily an automatic and effortless process, deeply rooted in real-time social interactions. Building on recent findings that infants as young as 7 months exhibit sophisticated understanding of mental states, this project will investigate the specific functional sub-components and the developmental trajectory of these mechanisms. Through a series of empirical studies, we will explore how these cognitive processes are triggered and how they evolve over time. Additionally, we will examine the broader implications of this new theoretical framework, which suggests that the system dedicated to understanding others' minds is fundamentally designed for collaborative and communicative interactions. This research promises to redefine our understanding of early social cognition and its neural basis."

We aim to explore and shed new theoretical light on the basic cognitive and brain mechanisms of the human social mind. One of these mechanisms that has received much attention by earlier approaches to ‘theory-of-mind’ research concerns the ability to infer and represent the mental states of others. Standard theories and research in the last twenty five years have suggested that representing other’s beliefs is an effortful and late developing capacity (Wellman et al., 2001) whose main function is to explain others’ behavior. Here we advance and propose to explore a new theoretical perspective according to which the mechanisms of mental state monitoring and representation involve primarily automatic and effortless processes grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Our approach is part of an on-going paradigm change in the field of theory-of-mind research motivated by the recent evidence showing that infants in their second year understand mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). Our own research has gone a significant step further by demonstrating that these mechanisms are present as early as 7 month of age, and by showing that both young infants and adults seem to automatically compute others’ beliefs even in situations where they are not required to do so (Kovács et al, in press Science). The present project explores the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants’ powerful belief computation abilities and to chart their developmental unfolding. Furthermore, we shall explore the implications of the new theoretical proposal that this dedicated system presupposes as its proper domain the on-going collaborative and communicative interactions.",
