        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe NUCLEARWATERS project introduces a novel perspective on the history of nuclear energy by focusing on its hydraulic dimensions. Unlike traditional approaches that emphasize nuclear physics and radiochemistry, this project argues that nuclear energy is fundamentally a hydraulic technology, rooted in centuries of global hydraulic engineering and cultural practices. By examining the continuity of water-manipulating technologies and risk perceptions from ancient civilizations to the modern era, the project aims to uncover the deep-seated social and professional practices that have shaped the nuclear industry. These practices, often resistant to change, have sometimes led to catastrophic outcomes. The research is organized into six work packages, each addressing the role of water in nuclear energy from different thematic and geographical perspectives. These include the study of the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the Soviet Union's nuclear water systems, the Rhine Valley as a nuclearized river basin, Japan’s atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region’s ecological and political challenges. Through this multifaceted approach, NUCLEARWATERS seeks to resolve key historical puzzles and provide a revised understanding of nuclear energy history, with implications for both academic fields such as the history of technology and environmental history, as well as the ongoing public discourse on the future of nuclear energy in Europe and beyond."

Rather than interpreting nuclear energy history as a history of nuclear physics and radiochemistry, it analyses it as a history of water. The project develops the argument that nuclear energy is in essence a hydraulic form of technology, and that it as such builds on centuries and even millennia of earlier hydraulic engineering efforts worldwide – and, culturally speaking, on earlier “hydraulic civilizations”, from ancient Egypt to the modern Netherlands. I investigate how historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions from a deeper past were carried on into the nuclear age. These risk conceptions brought with them a complex set of social and professional practices that displayed considerable inertia and were difficult to change – sometimes paving the way for disaster. Against this background I hypothesize that a water-centred nuclear energy history enables us to resolve a number of the key riddles in nuclear energy history and to grasp the deeper historical logic behind various nuclear disasters and accidents worldwide. The project is structured along six work packages that problematize the centrality – and dilemma – of water in nuclear energy history from different thematic and geographical angles. These include in-depth studies of the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, of the Soviet Union’s nuclear waters, of the Rhine Valley as a transnational and heavily nuclearized river basin, of Japan’s atomic coastscapes and of the ecologically and politically fragile Baltic Sea region. The ultimate ambition is to significantly revise nuclear energy history as we know it – with implications not only for the history of technology as an academic field (and its relationship with environmental history), but also for the public debate about nuclear energy’s future in Europe and beyond.",
