        "The WRAPPED (Widespread Analysis and Research on Myelin Plasticity and Development) project aims to elucidate the biological underpinnings of human learning by focusing on the role of myelin in brain plasticity across different developmental stages. Unlike other species, human myelin maturation extends well into adulthood, a protracted process that may critically influence our exceptional learning capabilities. By leveraging recent advancements in MRI technology, WRAPPED will conduct a comprehensive investigation into how myelin changes during learning. The project will employ a dual approach, combining longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data to explore myelin dynamics in infants, children, young adults, and older adults. Specific learning milestones, such as crawling, school entry, and the acquisition of novel skills like juggling and reading Chinese, will be studied to understand how myelin development interacts with learning processes. This ambitious research will not only enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms that support human learning and cultural development but also provide crucial insights into neurological and psychological disorders associated with myelin alterations, including schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. By characterizing healthy brain plasticity, WRAPPED aims to establish a foundational reference for the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions."

What is the biological basis of this remarkable plasticity? Animal studies suggest a critical role of myelin in learning and brain plasticity, while post-mortem assessments of the human brain show that myelin maturation, which is completed around birth in other species, continues until adulthood. How does this uniquely protracted myelin development enable and constrain our aptitude for learning? WRAPPED will answer this critical question by assessing changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. Recent critical advances in MRI technology now provide the unprecedented opportunity to compare myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals making it possible to probe the role of myelin in human learning for the first time. Seizing this opportunity, WRAPPED will assess learning-related changes in myelin using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. Critically, WRAPPED will not only evaluate adults, but rather probe the entire developmental lifespan to show how myelin changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults are acquiring the same novel skills (juggling and reading Chinese). This ambitious developmental focus will be transformative for our understanding of the interactions between maturational and learning-related changes in myelin. Thereby, WRAPPED will elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory that allows us to establish and maintain complex cultures. This characterization of healthy human brain plasticity, in turn, will serve as a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.",
