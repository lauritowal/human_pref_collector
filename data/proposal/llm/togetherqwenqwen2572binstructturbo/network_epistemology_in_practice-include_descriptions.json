        "This project aims to advance the history and philosophy of science by leveraging cutting-edge digital humanities tools to analyze the intricate processes of knowledge generation and validation in large-scale scientific collaborations. Specifically, the project will focus on the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) and its recent research practices in particle physics. The central hypothesis is that a comprehensive understanding of collective research processes can be achieved through a detailed analysis of the internal communication within these collaborations. This will involve the examination of born-digital documents, such as emails and internal wiki pages, which are integral to CERN's research activities. By reconstructing and analyzing these communication patterns, the project will provide insights into the epistemological dynamics of large scientific teams. Additionally, the project will develop historiographic guidelines that can be applied to future studies of modern scientific collaborations, enhancing the methodological toolkit for researchers. Furthermore, the findings will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, particularly in the area of \"network epistemology,\" by refining theoretical models to better reflect real-world scenarios. This work addresses a significant gap in the current literature, where studies of CERN and similar large-scale research endeavors have primarily relied on published articles, interviews, and participant observations. By integrating digital tools and computational methods, this project will offer a more nuanced and comprehensive perspective on the research practices in particle physics, with broader implications for the study of scientific collaboration."

The project will focus on an investigation of recent research practice in particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in order to gain a better understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in very large scientific collaborations. The main working hypothesis of the project is that collective research processes can be characterized, in epistemologically relevant terms, through a bird’s eye view analysis of the collaboration’s internal communication. The internal communication will be reconstructed from born-digital documents (e-mails, internal wiki pages, etc.) which accrue in the research practice of the collaboration. Abstracting from the case study, the project will also develop historiographic guidelines that can be transferred to future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations. Last but not least, the project will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, in particular to recent issues in “network epistemology”, by adapting the theoretical models to better fit important real-world cases. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to capture large-scale and complex research processes, such as the ones at CERN, and make them accessible for epistemological analysis. Almost all the studies of the research practice at CERN or similar cases have so far been restricted to the analysis of published articles, selected interviews and participant observation. Accompanied by historiographic guidelines and practical strategies (both of which are lacking at the moment) for best practices in the history and philosophy of science based on born-digital sources, the application of digital tools and computational methods may finally help us attain a maximally comprehensive picture of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond.",
