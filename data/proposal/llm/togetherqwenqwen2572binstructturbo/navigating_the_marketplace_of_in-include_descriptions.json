        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the contemporary landscape of global governance, the proliferation of Country Performance Indicators (CPIs) has transformed how states are assessed and ranked across various policy domains. While the abundance of CPIs promises enhanced data-driven decision-making, it paradoxically complicates the policy environment by introducing ambiguity and conflicting metrics. This project, Navigator, addresses the critical question of how public and private entities navigate this complex \"marketplace of indicators\" across four key policy areas: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Drawing on the liberal theory of the marketplace of ideas, Navigator develops a novel framework to systematically analyze the longitudinal dynamics of CPI usage and production. Specifically, the project examines whether CPI users adapt their practices in response to criticism, how they discern between competing indicators, and how producers strategize to gain user trust in crowded policy fields. By shifting the focus from the influence of individual CPIs to the adaptive behaviors of users and producers, Navigator aims to advance the field of CPI research and provide actionable insights for improving the quality and utility of performance metrics in global governance."

States are now measured and ranked on a dizzying array of cross-cutting metrics. Prima facie, the era of indicators promises a revolution: armed with ever improving data, policymakers can better allocate scarce resources to address global challenges. Yet, the era of indicators generates a problem and a paradox: while each individual CPI strives to simplify complexity, an abundance of CPIs on the same issue multiplies complexity and thus generates ambiguity. Moreover, while it would be reassuring if we could assume only the soundest CPIs would thrive, many high-profile CPIs remain in widespread use despite well-known shortcomings.Crucially, the paradox begets a major puzzle that prior research has yet to consider: How do private and public bodies navigate policy fields populated with multiple indicators, each portending to measure the same phenomenon? Although prior research provides firm grounds to hope that CPI users and producers improve their practices over time, no studies have investigated whether they do. Rendering this gap tractable, Navigator investigates the “marketplace of indicators” in four major policy fields: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Navigator’s novel framework—inspired by the classic liberal theory of the marketplace of ideas—enables the systemic, longitudinal analysis of how users’ and producers adapt their practices over time: Whether users learn in light of criticism of their favoured CPIs, how they discern when faced with a diversity of CPIs; and how producers compete for users within crowded policy fields. In this way, Navigator would push the frontier of CPI research by conducting a systematic problem shift: from investigating a single CPI’s influence or limitations, to examining how users and producers adapt in the face of growing CPI competition and CPI critique.",
