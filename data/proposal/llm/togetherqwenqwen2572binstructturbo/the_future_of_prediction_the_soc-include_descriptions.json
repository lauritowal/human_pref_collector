    "descriptions": [
        "This project addresses the profound transformation in how society manages uncertainty in the age of Big Data and Machine Learning. As algorithmic prediction gains prominence, it challenges the traditional probabilistic methods that have shaped social institutions. This shift from managing shared uncertainty to leveraging predictive algorithms introduces new dynamics and potential disruptions across various sectors. The proposed research will conduct a series of theory-driven empirical studies to explore this transition, focusing on three key areas: personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing.\n\nIn personalized insurance, the study will examine how individualized predictions impact the mutualization principle, which is central to actuarial practices. This area will highlight the tension between personalized risk assessment and the collective pooling of risks.\n\nFor precision medicine, the research will investigate the integration of algorithmic procedures with established statistical methods, focusing on the challenge of generalizing findings across diverse populations. This dimension is crucial for ensuring that predictive models are both accurate and applicable in clinical settings.\n\nFinally, in predictive policing, the project will delve into the issues of bias and the blurring lines between prevention and repression. This area will explore how predictive algorithms can both enhance public safety and potentially perpetuate systemic inequalities.\n\nBy addressing these critical dimensions, the project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding the social, technical, and theoretical implications of the shift from probabilistic uncertainty management to algorithmic prediction. This research will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars navigating the complexities of the digital society."

Recent advances in digital forecasting claim to provide a predictive score for individual persons or singular events, thereby introducing a new way to manage the uncertainty of the future. But knowing the future in advance is not only advantageous. In fact, for our society, uncertainty about the future is also a resource. Since modernity, with the support of probability calculus various social institutions in different domains have developed means of coping with ignorance of the future by starting with the one thing that we all share – uncertainty. What happens to the stabilized forms of management of the future when their first resource – shared uncertainty – is missing? There is still no systematic research on this groundbreaking transformation. This project proposes a set of theory-driven empirical studies of the transition from probabilistic forms of uncertainty management to the new algorithmic forms of prediction. We will investigate three important social areas highlighting three fundamental dimensions with which digital forecast must deal. 1) First we will focus on personalized insurance. Here the key dimension is individualization of prediction, where the challenge is that such prediction could undermine the mutualization principle organized around actuarial practices. 2) Our second research area is precision medicine, highlighting the dimension of generalization where the challenge is the combination of algorithmic procedures with established statistical methods. 3) In the third field, predictive policing underscores the problem of bias while it challenges the distinction between prevention and repression. Exploring these transformation and its consequences, the project aims at developing a comprehensive approach to study the social, technical and theoretical aspects of prediction in digital society",
