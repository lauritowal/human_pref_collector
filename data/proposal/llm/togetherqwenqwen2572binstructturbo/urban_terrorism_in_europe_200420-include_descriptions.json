        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe UrbTerr project aims to deliver a pioneering, comparative analysis of the memory discourses and societal responses to urban terrorism in four major European countries—Spain, the UK, France, and Germany—each of which has suffered significant acts of violence since 2004. By integrating methodologies from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, UrbTerr will explore the diverse narratives that have emerged in the wake of these tragic events. The project will focus on three key areas: (1) the collective processes of remembering, forgetting, and imagining that have reshaped urban environments; (2) the development of a new materialist framework to critically evaluate the policies and security infrastructures implemented in response to terrorism; and (3) the use of performance art as a means to foster alternative forms of remembrance and envision future possibilities. Through a comprehensive research agenda, including interviews with city residents, policymakers, and cultural figures, as well as the production of academic publications and public performances, UrbTerr seeks to challenge prevailing notions of security and creativity in the context of urban terrorism. The project's outputs will include a dedicated website, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of provocative public performances by the 'Center for Political Beauty,' all designed to stimulate critical discussions on the securitization of contemporary European cities."

Whilst trying to come to terms with recent acts of urban terrorism, governments, security agencies, and local communities are bracing themselves for further attacks. UrbTerr will offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in four European countries that have suffered particularly as a result of this wave of violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Drawing on concepts and methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory and anthropology, UrbTerr will document and analyse a range of voices in contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe and problematise the narrow concept of imagination and creativity underpinning recent counter-terrorism measures and a great part of the academic literature on this subject. It will: (1) analyse the collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining that have shaped urban spaces in the four countries after recent terrorist attacks; (2) develop a new materialist approach to terrorism and use this framework to critically assess policies and material security infrastructures that were created in response to these attacks at a local and European level; (3) use performance art as a creative tool to develop and experiment with alternative forms of remembering and different visions of the future. Outputs of the project will include a website with footage of interviews with city residents, politicians, architects, political activists, and other key actors, as well as other resources for terrorism research, two academic monographs, articles in peer-reviewed journals, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of thought-provoking public performances by the art group ‘Center for Political Beauty’ that will spark critical debates about securitization processes in contemporary Europe.",
