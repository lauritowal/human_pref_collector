        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe POLEMIC project seeks to explore the impact of emotional appeals in political discourse and their influence on citizen behavior. Despite the widespread belief that contemporary politicians, such as Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, and Marine Le Pen, are increasingly leveraging emotional rhetoric to gain political power, there is a critical gap in understanding how and why these appeals are effective. This project will extend current theoretical frameworks and employ innovative methodologies to elucidate the conditions under which emotional appeals are persuasive and when pre-existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders, or issues mitigate their impact.\n\nPOLEMIC will generate and analyze unique, historical data on emotional appeals made by politicians across nine countries from 1945 to the present. By developing and testing three theoretical perspectives—vote-maximizing strategy, politician personality, and cultural fashion—this project aims to uncover the motivations behind the use of emotional appeals. Utilizing advanced automated text analysis to quantify emotional content in political speeches and physiological measurements to assess emotional responses in citizens, POLEMIC will bridge the gap between macro-level political strategies and micro-level psychological reactions.\n\nThe project's comprehensive approach will provide insights into the role of emotion in political decision-making, offering a nuanced understanding of the rationality behind politicians' use of emotional appeals. By integrating political science with political psychology, POLEMIC will contribute valuable knowledge to the fields of political communication and public opinion."

With highly emotive language people like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen are pounding on the portals to power. Do such emotional appeals affect citizens’ political choices? Yes, they can. But, citizens’ existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders or issues moderate the success of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theory and use novel methods to explain when (types of) emotional appeals are persuasive, and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. Do politicians actually make more emotional appeals than in the past? And if so why are they doing it? We lack historical data of emotional appeals so we cannot answer these questions. POLEMIC will provide unique, historical data (1945-now, 9 countries) of emotional appeals by politicians in their speeches. I develop and test 3 alternative theories from different intellectual traditions that explain why politicians make emotional appeals: is it either (1) a vote-maximizing strategy, (2) a product of the personality of a politician or (3) just fashionable? POLEMIC analyses emotional appeals of politicians and the emotional responses of citizens to these appeals. Emotional appeals are texts, and emotions are experiences by the brain. To measure them POLEMIC will use innovative methods in political science: automated text analysis to extract emotion from appeals; physiological measurement to measure emotions. POLEMIC offers a ground-breaking combination of a macro-perspective (what politicians say) and a micro-perspective (how citizens respond) and forms a bridge between party politics and political psychology. The project’s output will indicate the importance of emotion in the decision-making of citizens, and the level of rationality that is behind politicians’ decision to make emotional appeals.",
