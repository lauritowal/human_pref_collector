        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the early human colonization of Australasia, a critical chapter in the global dispersal of modern humans. By focusing on the maritime migration from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia) around 50,000 years ago, this project seeks to uncover the technological, cognitive, and social capabilities that enabled this significant journey. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the research will integrate advanced marine geophysical surveys, hydrodynamic modeling, and archaeogenetic analysis to address key questions about the timing, routes, and methods of this early seafaring. Specifically, the project will explore the submerged palaeolandscape of the northwestern Australian continental shelf to identify potential prehistoric sites and understand the ancient shoreline and tidal conditions. Complementary archaeogenetic studies will analyze mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to elucidate demographic patterns and migration timelines. This comprehensive investigation promises to provide unprecedented insights into early human seafaring, the interaction between humans and their environment, and the complex social and cognitive processes that supported such pioneering voyages."

This represents some of the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa, yet, even at the greatest sea-level lowstand, this migration would have involved seafaring. It is the maritime nature of this dispersal which makes it so important to questions of technological, cognitive and social human development. These issues have traditionally been the preserve of archaeologists, but with a multidisciplinary approach that embraces cutting-edge marine geophysical, hydrodynamic and archaeogenetic analyses, we now have the opportunity to examine the When, Where, Who and How of the earliest seafaring in world history. The voyage from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia) provides evidence for the earliest ‘open water’ crossing in the world. A combination of the sparse number of early archaeological finds and the significant changes in the palaeolandscape and submergence of the broad north western Australian continental shelf, mean that little is known about the routes taken and what these crossings may have entailed. This project will combine research of the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf to refine our knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, identify potential submerged prehistoric sites and enhance our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. This will be combined with archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and dating. For the first time this project takes a truly multidisciplinary approach to address the colonization of Sahul, providing an unique opportunity to tackle some of the most important questions about human origins, the relationship between humans and the changing environment, population dynamics and migration, seafaring technology, social organisation and cognition.",
