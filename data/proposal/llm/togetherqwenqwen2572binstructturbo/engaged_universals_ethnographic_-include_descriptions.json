    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe UNIVERSAL HEALTH project is a comprehensive anthropological investigation into the implementation and impact of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries. UHC, a cornerstone of the Sustainable Development Goals, aims to ensure that all individuals can access necessary health services without suffering financial hardship. This concept is particularly pertinent in Africa, where historical policies have weakened state capacities, promoted privatization, and disproportionately burdened the poor. Despite recent global health initiatives, national health-care systems remain underfunded, and trust in these systems is low. UHC, therefore, represents a critical opportunity to reframe health as a public good and a matter of state responsibility. However, its implementation is fraught with conflicting interests, making it a rich field for anthropological inquiry.\n\nThis project will explore the dynamics of UHC at global, national, and local levels, examining how it influences relationships between states and citizens, intersects with formal social protection systems, and interacts with informal social networks that support health. By employing a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, the research will capture the complexities and frictions surrounding UHC, from policy-making to public debate. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how universal health policies are adapted and contested in diverse social and political contexts, offering insights relevant to global health policy and the broader discourse on the public good."

Defined by the WHO as ensuring that all people can use the health services they need without financial hardship, UHC is a powerful concept that approaches public health as a matter of justice and obligation and is included in the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC is particularly important in Africa, where structural-adjustment policies undermined state capacity, promoted privatization and pushed the burden of payment onto the poor. Recent global health initiatives have done little to address the neglect of national health-care systems and citizens’ lack of trust in them. In these contexts UHC is interesting because it reinserts questions of state responsibility and the public good into health-care. Historically however, African states have only partially pursued the public good, while in practice UHC is surrounding by conflicting interests. UHC is thus not a universal model but a contested field, making it an intriguing site for anthropological research. With a focus on actors and institutions at global, national and local levels in each country, the project will explore how moves towards UHC engage relations between states and citizens and universal concepts such as the public good; how UHC intersects with formal systems of social protection; and how it influences informal social networks that support health, thus situating UHC in national histories and social practices. Tracking the frictions surrounding UHC at the levels of policy-making, implementation, among beneficiaries, and in public debate, the project will use ethnographic methodology in innovative ways through fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level. The project’s focus on a global policy and the public good opens new research directions and will produce knowledge of relevance beyond Africa.",
