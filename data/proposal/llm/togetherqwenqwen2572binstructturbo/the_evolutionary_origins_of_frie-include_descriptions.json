    "descriptions": [
        "Friendship is a vital component of human health and well-being, with social isolation posing significant risks that rival those of smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity. Addressing the rising issue of social isolation is a pressing concern for public health and policy. To fully comprehend the importance of friendship and its implications, it is essential to explore its evolutionary roots and the extent of its human uniqueness. This project aims to elucidate the evolutionary origins of friendship by examining the social dynamics of nonhuman primates, particularly macaques, to identify the causes and consequences of friendship in an evolutionary context. Through a series of groundbreaking studies, I will create a comprehensive cross-species dataset on macaques and conduct innovative social experiments on a unique population. The project has three primary objectives: (1) to investigate the environmental factors that influence the formation of social bonds across different species; (2) to determine whether the ability to understand and track the friendships of unrelated individuals is a uniquely human trait; and (3) to explore whether social isolation is a result of competitive exclusion within primate groups. By addressing these aims, this research will provide critical insights into the evolutionary significance of friendship and its role in human social behavior, contributing to a deeper understanding of what it means to be human."

People who are socially isolated have a greater risk of heart disease than heavy smokers, drinkers, and the obese, and halting social isolation’s ongoing rise is a growing priority for public health and political policy. But coming to grips with our need for friends and the consequences we face in their absence requires we not only look at how friendship is manifested in contemporary societies but to its origins in our evolutionary past. Yet, the evolutionary origins of friendship and the degree to which friendship’s components reflect human specializations are unclear. Studying nonhuman primates allows us to identify the causes and consequences of friendship in evolutionary time and the extent of its human uniqueness. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly little about the contexts that drove friendly social bonds to emerge, whether friendship-relevant cognitive abilities reflect primate universals, and the reasons why evolution allows social isolation to persist despite being detrimental. In this project, I will conduct a series of landmark studies to reveal critical insights into the evolutionary origins of friendship. I will generate an unparalleled cross-species dataset on the best-known taxa of group-living primates, the macaques, and will perform innovative social experiments on a unique macaque population. I have three key aims: (1) to test the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species; (2) to establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill; and (3) to test whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion. Friendship may be one of the most important strategies humans have for surviving in large groups. Understanding friendship from an evolutionary perspective is therefore a critical component of understanding what it means to be human. The proposed project represents a major step forward in that endeavour.",
