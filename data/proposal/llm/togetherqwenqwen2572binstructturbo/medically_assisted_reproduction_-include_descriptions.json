        "**Abstract:**\n\nMedically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) has revolutionized fertility treatment over the past four decades, with over five million children conceived through these methods and a growing number of families receiving treatment annually. Despite its widespread use, the impact of MAR on the well-being of children, adults, and families remains unclear, with existing research often limited by small sample sizes and methodological constraints. This proposal outlines a comprehensive research program designed to address these gaps by leveraging large, detailed datasets from population registers and surveys, and employing innovative research designs. The study will analyze the effects of MAR across various life domains, including physical and mental health, educational outcomes, and family stability, for both adults and children. By comparing MAR-conceived children to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and successful MAR patients to those who were unsuccessful, the project aims to establish causal relationships and uncover any trade-offs associated with MAR. The findings are expected to yield groundbreaking insights that will inform future research, guide health professionals in advising couples, assist public health authorities in resource allocation, and influence policy decisions regarding the subsidization of MAR treatments. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the long-term implications of MAR and contribute to the development of more effective and equitable reproductive health policies."

In advanced societies, the number of MAR treatments increases every year, and, over the last four decades, more than five million MAR conceived children were born, and many more families received treatment. Given this trend, it is a public health prerogative to find out whether MAR affects the well-being of families. Prior findings are mixed and often hampered by low statistical power or conceptual limitations. I propose a programme of research that goes beyond the state-of-the-art by being the first to analyze comprehensively the effects of MAR on children, adults, and families through a combination of uniquely rich data, previously unused research designs, and conceptual innovations. First, in contrast to past work using small or convenience samples, I use extremely detailed and large datasets from population registers and surveys. Second, I compare the impact of MAR on different domains of life by analysing its effects on a range of adult and child outcomes (e.g., physical/mental health, education, union stability), thereby allowing me to investigate trade-offs that have not been previously tested. Third, I use innovative research designs to test whether the impact of MAR is causal by comparing children conceived through MAR treatments to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and adults who successfully conceive through MAR to those who are unsuccessful. The project has the potential to produce ground-breaking results that will impact future research in this field. Moreover, the project will have important policy implications, as its findings will be immediately relevant to health professionals advising couples seeking MAR treatments, to public health authorities allocating resources to mitigate the potentially negative effects of MAR on health, and to policy-makers considering whether to (further) subsidize MAR treatments.",
