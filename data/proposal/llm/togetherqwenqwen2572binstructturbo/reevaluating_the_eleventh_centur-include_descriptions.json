        "The RELEVEN project seeks to innovate in the creation and curation of digital historical data, specifically targeting the methodological complexities of medieval history. By reconceptualizing historical data as assertions linked to authoritative sources, the project aims to enhance data manipulation and analysis, reflecting the nuanced and often contested nature of historical evidence, particularly in pre-modern contexts. This methodology will enable historians to explore the interconnections, corroboration, and conflicts between different historical claims more effectively. The project will focus on the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), a period marked by significant trans-regional interactions, especially in the eastern half of Christendom. This era, leading up to the First Crusade, is rich with historical narratives that often overshadow broader trends of communication and contact. By leveraging existing digital resources and scholarly work in prosopography, textual studies, and archaeology, and by framing these in terms of assertions with traceable authority, the project aims to provide a more comprehensive and multi-perspective view of this critical period. This approach not only enriches our understanding of medieval history but also sets a new standard for the digital curation and analysis of historical data."

The approach is to re-frame both existing and new historical data as assertions, often sourced but always linked to an authority; this allows data to be manipulated according to source and authority, and also allows assertions themselves to be linked depending on whether they corroborate, depend on, or conflict with each other. The novel aspect of this methodology is that it takes to its logical conclusion something that historians all readily acknowledge and that is especially apparent for pre-modern history: that there are very few, if any, simple and undisputed facts. A related challenge is the contextualisation and reuse of existing online data for the period, to avoid its going to waste. The approach is tested by taking a broad trans-regional approach to the history of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), centred broadly in the eastern half of Christendom but incorporating developments elsewhere, especially in the newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The looming weight of the First Crusade at the century's end means that while certain regional or proto-national narratives—particularly for western Europe—are well-developed, they tend to obscure the larger trans-regional trends of communication and contact, particularly in eastern Christendom. By drawing upon the depth of scholarship and the plethora of digital resources that have emerged for this period in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, and by framing this scholarship in terms of assertions whose authority is traceable, it will become possible to look at the history not just from \"the eastern perspective\", but from several.",
