    "descriptions": [
        "This project aims to conduct a multi-sited ethnographic study of the emerging landscape of big data and AI-informed national health governance. Recognizing health data as a critical resource, often likened to 'future oil,' the project addresses the growing concerns around algorithmic ethics and the potential for AI to perpetuate social biases and discrimination. While existing research has primarily focused on the technical and legal aspects of AI, this study will delve into the socio-cultural dimensions of AI integration in healthcare settings, particularly the interactions between human agents and AI systems. The research will explore critical moments when data analysts either adhere to or deviate from AI recommendations, which can significantly influence national health policies and individual outcomes. By conducting studies in six diverse national settings, the project seeks to identify the contextual and organizational factors that shape ethical AI practices. Utilizing innovative anthropological methods, including future-scenarioing, the project will not only enrich the anthropological discipline but also provide actionable insights for AI developers, health policymakers, and decision-makers. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of more equitable and ethical AI systems in healthcare."

With health data being considered countries’ ‘future oil’, public and scholarly concerns about ‘algorithmic ethics’ rise. Research has long shown that datasets in AI (re)produce social biases, discriminate and limit personal autonomy. This literature, however, has merely focused on AI design and institutional frameworks, examining the subject through legal, technocratic and philosophical perspectives, whilst overlooking the socio-cultural context in which big data and AI systems are embedded, most particularly organizations in which human agents collaborate with AI. This is problematic, as frameworks for ‘ethical AI’ currently consider human oversight crucial, assuming that humans will correct or resist AI when needed; while empirical evidence for this assumption is extremely thin. Very little is known about when and why people intervene or resist AI. Research done consists of single, mostly Western studies, making it impossible to generalize findings. The innovative force of our research is fourfold: 1) To empirically analyze decisive moments in which data-analysts follow or deviate AI: moments deeply impacting national health policies and individual human lives. 2) To do research in six national settings with various governmental frameworks and in different organizational contexts, enabling us to contrast findings, eventually leading to a theory on the contextual, organizational factors underlying ethical AI. 3) To use innovative anthropological methods of future-scenarioing, which will enrich the anthropological discipline by developing and finetuning future-focused research. 4) The research connects anthropological insights with the expertise of AI-developers, and partners with relevant health decisionmakers and policy-institutions, allowing to both analyze and contribute to fair AI.",
