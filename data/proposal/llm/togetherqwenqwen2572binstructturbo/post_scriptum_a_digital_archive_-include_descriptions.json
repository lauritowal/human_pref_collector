        "The P.S. project aims to systematically collect, edit, and conduct a historical-linguistic study of personal letters from the Early Modern period (17th to early 19th century) in Portugal and Spain. These letters, written by a diverse range of social actors including servants, soldiers, and artisans, were often seized by the Inquisition and civil courts as evidence. Accompanied by detailed judicial records, these documents provide a unique window into the interpersonal dynamics and daily lives of traditional communities. The letters frequently exhibit an almost oral style, rich in emotion, common beliefs, and everyday narratives, offering rare insights into Early Modern popular discourse. The project will create a comprehensive digital archive, adhering to Textual Criticism standards, and integrate philological analysis with cultural and linguistic studies to enhance our understanding of this underexplored aspect of history."

The documents in question are original epistolary writings made by servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, political fighters, and many other types of social agents whose paths were crossed by the prosecuting ways of the Inquisition and the civil courts, two institutions that used to seize personal correspondence as instrumental proof. Since the documents are accompanied by the ‘sociological interviews’ carried out by inquisitors and judges, they allow researchers a well-contextualized study of traditional communities in their inter-personal modes of relation. The sources’ texts contain very frequently an (almost) oral rhetoric through which emotions were expressed, commonsense was stated, non-orthodox beliefs were confessed and trivial incidents were narrated. Until now, it has been difficult to discover more than thin samples of this Early Modern ‘popular’ discourse. The P.S. project will not only assemble a large collection of it, but it will also match its philological treatment – an online digital edition following Textual Criticism standards – with the cultural and linguistic study of its contents.",
