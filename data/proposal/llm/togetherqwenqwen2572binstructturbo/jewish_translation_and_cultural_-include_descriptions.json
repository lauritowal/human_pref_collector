        "This research project seeks to reconceptualize the process of modernization, particularly as it pertains to Jewish culture, by examining the role of translation in the early modern period. While traditional narratives often frame modernity as a sudden and radical break from the past, this project argues that modernization was more a nuanced and gradual process, characterized by the selective and often cautious adoption of new ideas. Focusing on the corpus of non-Jewish texts translated into Jewish languages during the early modern era, the study aims to uncover the ways in which Jewish translators adapted and transformed these works to align with their own cultural and religious contexts. These translations, which have been largely overlooked by modern scholarship, played a crucial role in shaping Jewish identity and culture from the sixteenth century onward. Through a comprehensive analysis of these translations, the project reveals a dynamic and interactive cultural landscape, where Jewish and non-Jewish ideas intersected and evolved. By highlighting the innovative and collaborative nature of these translations, the project challenges the notion of a rigid cultural boundary between Jews and their Christian neighbors, and proposes a new understanding of the early modern \"Jewish book\" as a site of cultural exchange and transformation. This research aims to contribute to broader discussions on the mechanisms of cultural transfer and the complexities of modernization, offering a fresh perspective on the interplay between tradition and innovation in early modern Europe."

This massive upheaval is said to have shaken the very foundations of every culture it frequented, subsequently eliminating the world which once was, to make way for a new age. This project offers a new understanding of modernization, not as a radical break with tradition, but as the careful importation of new ideas by often timid, almost inadvertent innovators. The project focuses on the rich corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which developed during the early modern period. Largely neglected by modern scholars, these translations played a pivotal role in fashioning Jewish culture from the sixteenth century into modern times. Jewish translators were never merely passive recipients of their non-Jewish sources; they mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, and harnessed their sources to meet their own unique agendas. Throughout the process of translation then, a new corpus was created, one that was distinctly Jewish in character, but closely corresponded with the surrounding majority culture. JEWTACT offers the first comprehensive study of the entire gamut of these early modern Jewish translations, exposing a hitherto unexplored terrain of surprising intercultural encounters which took place upon the advent of modernity—between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. The project posits translation as the primary and most ubiquitous mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer in early modern Europe. In so doing, I wish to revolutionize our understanding of the so-called early modern “Jewish book,” revealing its intensely porous, collaborative and innovative nature, and to offer a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange.",
