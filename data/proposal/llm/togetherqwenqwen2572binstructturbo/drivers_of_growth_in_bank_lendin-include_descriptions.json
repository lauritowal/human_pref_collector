        "This grant proposal seeks to elucidate the complex dynamics underlying recurrent banking crises, particularly focusing on the precipitous credit growth that often precedes such events. The project aims to address the gap in empirical evidence regarding the roles of financial innovations, mortgage lending, real estate price fluctuations, borrower information asymmetry, and the leverage levels of financial institutions. By leveraging a unique set of micro-level datasets and advanced econometric techniques, the research will provide a detailed analysis of how these factors independently and collectively influence credit expansion. The primary objective is to enhance the identification and estimation methods for assessing the impact of each factor on loan growth, thereby contributing to a more robust framework for macroprudential regulation. Additionally, the project will develop theoretical models where empirical evidence is scarce, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which these factors interact. The findings will not only advance academic knowledge but also inform policymakers in crafting more effective regulatory measures to mitigate the systemic risks associated with excessive credit growth."

Their damaging real effects have generated a broad agreement among academics and policymakers that financial regulation needs to tighten and to obtain a macroprudential dimension that aims to lessen the negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector. Among the main ingredients that are often mentioned to have played a role in the explosive growth of credit in the run-up to the latest financial crisis are the financial innovations by financial institutions, in particular loan securitization, the boom in mortgage lending and prices of real estate, the lack of information about prospective borrowers, and the high leverage (and corresponding low capital ratios) of financial institutions. Yet, despite the singling out of these ingredients by policymakers, decisive empirical evidence about their role and relevancy is lacking. However, given the magnitude and complexity of the global banking system and the lack of encompassing micro-level data, it is currently impossible to confidently study the impact of all ingredients jointly. This project therefore analyses pertinent settings where we can empirically identify the correspondence between the aforementioned individual ingredients and the credit granting by financial institutions. The objective of the project is to advance identification and estimation of the impact of each respective factor on loan growth by combining the appropriate methodology with an exceptional set of micro-level datasets. When missing in the literature a theoretical framework will be provided. The project further aims to assess how potential combinations of these ingredients may have interacted in spurring credit growth. While the identification of the impact of each ingredient on credit growth is paramount, the individual setting of the studied datasets and employed methodologies will ensure maximum external validity.",
