        "**Abstract:**\n\nGLOBECOSAL seeks to explore the role of artworks in the negotiation of sanctity with the Roman Curia during the era of Iberian dominance, focusing on the post-Tridentine period. This project examines the creation and circulation of artworks associated with the cult of Catholic blesseds and saints, particularly those linked to the expansion of the Iberian empires. The cult of saints was a critical arena in the Catholic Church's response to Protestantism, serving multiple spiritual, ideological, and propagandistic functions. While art historical studies often emphasize adherence to Tridentine models of sanctity, they frequently overlook the diverse local constructions of sanctity, especially in the context of newly Christianized territories. GLOBECOSAL hypothesizes that artworks produced to gain Church recognition for local saints reveal a negotiation of spiritual status within the broader framework of universal Catholicism. These artworks functioned as tools of self-representation and identity formation for local Catholic communities. By tracing the movement of objects and iconographies within and between global knowledge networks, the project integrates a 'global market of symbolic values' framework, drawing from critical sociology. This interdisciplinary approach not only 'globalizes' the history of early modern art but also challenges conventional views on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world."

As the cult of the saints was among the key conceptual battlegrounds in the conflict between the Catholic church and the Protestants, in the post-Tridentine period, saints came to fulfill spiritual, ideological and propagandistic purposes. Art history has paid heightened attention to the adherence of artworks to the models of sanctity formulated by the Tridentine church, leading to an overall neglect of competing local constructions of sanctity, a shortfall particularly momentous with regard to blesseds and saints connected in different ways to the process of European expansion, specifically to the Iberian empires. The hypothesis under examination is that the artworks produced in relation to gaining recognition by the Church of saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories reveal an underlying negotiation of the local Catholic communities’ spiritual status within universal Catholicism. As official recognition affirmed the society which had made a saint its own, artworks related to this process served purposes of self-representation within the broader framework of social identity formation. GLOBECOSAL traces the circulation of material objects and iconographies within and between global networks of knowledge transmission, and combines this approach with a hypothetical ‘global market of symbolic values’ developed on the basis of concepts from critical sociology. Investigating the negotiation of sanctity between Rome and geographically distant areas participates in ‘globalizing’ the history of early modern art and is qualified to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world at large.",
