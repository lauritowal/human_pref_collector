        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe MEGAMAPS project seeks to conduct a comprehensive transnational study on Artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space following the 2011 uprisings. Employing an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that integrates History, Social Movements Theory, Gender Studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities, the project will focus on Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Through a combination of fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS aims to produce an unprecedented history from below, exploring the dynamic interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change. This research will not only enrich global academic knowledge about the Arab region but also shed light on how Artivism serves as a political incubator, fostering egalitarian societal projects in the face of post-2011 authoritarianism. The project will culminate in academic publications and the creation of the first open-access, participatory digital platform. This platform will systematically document and interconnect a rich corpus of living sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools. The platform aims to innovate traditional approaches in History and Social Movements Theory, provide a dedicated research resource on Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region, and ensure FAIR access to these resources for academics, stakeholders, and the general public. Additionally, MEGAMAPS will facilitate a series of dissemination activities to enhance the participation of activists in a transnational network of artists, researchers, policymakers, and civil society stakeholders. These activities will promote the exchange of best practices in gender equality, arts, and democratic governance, and contribute to shifting the paradigm from victimization to agency for women and sexual minorities in the Arab region, while also challenging orientalism and islamophobia in Western public opinion."

By focusing on 4 countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia) the project aims to innovate the global academic knowledge on the Arab region by the writing of an unprecedented history from below which investigates the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent and social change. Based on fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS aims to frame, explore and map emerging Artivism for gender equality, conceived as a political incubator which revitalizes an egalitarian project of society in the post-2011 authoritarian ebb. In addition to academic publications, the project aims at producing the first open access and participative digital platform which will consistently document, systematize and interconnect a corpus of living sources (visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and cartographies, maps, graphic tools) and will: a) innovate the traditional approaches of History and Social Movements Theory on the Arab region; b) provide the first research platform dealing with Artivism, gender and social change in the Arab region; c) make this corpus FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders and to the general public. MEGAMAPS also involves a set of dissemination activities aimed to improve activistsâ€™ participation in a transnational network of artists, researchers, policy-makers and civil society stakeholders in order to promote mutual exchanges of best practices in the field of gender equality, arts and democratic governance, and to contribute in reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities in the Arab region by proposing an agency paradigm, which can also overcome orientalism and islamophobia within the Western public opinion.",
