        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe CAPASIA project re-examines the origins and evolution of modern industrial capitalism by focusing on the dynamic trading ports of the Indian Ocean, specifically during the early modern period (1500-1800). These ports, known as 'factories,' served as crucial nodes for global trade, controlled by European East India companies such as the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French. Unlike the contemporary industrial factories, these trade hubs were managed by company servants called 'factors' and were instrumental in assembling, storing, and shipping commodities for intercontinental trade. CAPASIA aims to investigate the genesis, development, and interconnectedness of over 150 such factories, contributing to a new spatial theory of capitalist development that complements and challenges the Atlantic-centric models proposed by the New History of Capitalism. By integrating extensive archival materials from European and Asian sources, the project seeks to decolonize the history of capitalism, incorporating the roles and interactions of both European and local merchants. Over a five-year period, CAPASIA will explore the economic activities within these trading centers, map the movement of goods, people, and information across an 'archipelago' of Asian ports, and collaborate with international scholars to recast the narrative of global economic change. This comprehensive study aims to provide a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of the foundations of modern capitalism."

CAPASIA locates the origins of modern industrial capitalism in the space of Asian ports in the Indian Ocean, where the Portuguese, as well as the Dutch, English, French, and other European East India companies operated in the early modern period (1500-1800). Well before the rise of 20th-century Special Economic Zones and world financial centres, the ports of maritime Asia (‘factories’) were areas of global trade and hubs of economic dynamism. Today ‘factories’ are places of industrial production, but they owe their name to these pre-modern Asian trading ports, European-controlled trade hubs headed by company servants called ‘factors’. Factories were places where commodities for intercontinental trade were assembled, stored and shipped. This project investigates the genesis, evolution, activities, and connections of over 150 small and large such factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development — complementing and challenging the current Atlantic plantation-based explanations proposed by the New History of Capitalism. CAPASIA’s integration of the large archival repositories of the different European East India companies and Asian archives will also be the basis for the ‘decolonization’ of the history of capitalism. Over its five-year duration, this project will ask: what kind of economic activities were carried out in these imperial trading centres? What were the interactive roles of European and local merchants? It will map the intercontinental movement of goods, people and information across an ‘archipelago’ of Asian ports. Working with collaborators from across the globe, CAPASIA’s overarching ambition is to recast the narrative of global economic change and capitalism by incorporating both Asian and European economic actors, and their interactions, in the space of the still unstudied factories of the Indian Ocean.",
