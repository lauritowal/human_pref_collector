        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to explore and elucidate the technical evolution and usage of pre-Mercator nautical charts, a critical yet under-examined aspect of early modern maritime expansion. Despite the significant role these charts played in the global explorations of European nations, their detailed technical development remains shrouded in mystery. By integrating traditional historical research with innovative methodologies, including analytical cartometric analysis, numerical modeling, and advanced manuscript examination techniques, this study seeks to uncover the hidden graphic elements and geometric characteristics of these charts. Through the examination of a diverse and extensive collection of charts from various periods and origins, the project will establish connections between chart construction and contemporary navigational practices and exploration missions. Preliminary research has already demonstrated the efficacy of these techniques, as evidenced by the resolution of a century-old historical puzzle: the construction of the Mercator projection in 1569. This proposal extends this approach to address a broader and more complex set of questions that have long eluded cartographic historians. The findings will not only contribute to the field of cartographic history but also enhance our understanding of the broader intellectual and scientific developments of the period."

This fact is very surprising as it was through those charts that the newly discovered world was first shown to the amazed eyes of the European nations. Although the History of Cartography is a well-established academic discipline and old charts have been examined for many years, their detailed technical study is still in its infancy. What is the origin of the pre-Mercator nautical chart, how charts evolved technically over time and how they were used at sea are all critical questions that remain to be answered. I intend to approach these challenges in a truly interdisciplinary way, by using innovative and powerful tools as a complement to the traditional methods of historical research: analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling and the examination of the manuscripts through special lighting. By applying these tools to a large sample of charts of various periods and origins, I aim to unveil hidden graphic content related to their construction and use, to characterize their main geometric features, to establish meaningful connections with contemporary navigational methods and exploration missions, and to numerically simulate their construction by taking into account the explanations given in the textual sources. The effectiveness of those techniques has already been demonstrated in my previous studies, such as in the solution of an historical enigma which had been alive for more than a century: the construction of the Mercator projection, in 1569. Now, I propose to handle a broader and more complex set of questions, which has eluded the historians of cartography for even a longer period. The clarification of these issues will have a ground-breaking impact, not only in the strict field of the History of Cartography, but also in the context of the intellectual history at large.",
