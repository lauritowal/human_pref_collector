        "The survival and development of human infants are intrinsically linked to the quality of parental caregiving. While evolutionary theories have long posited that specific infant facial features elicit caregiving responses, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. This proposal aims to elucidate the brain changes associated with both normal and disrupted parental caregiving in new parents through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. \n\nSubproject 1 will conduct a longitudinal study to examine the structural and functional brain changes in expectant and new parents, both male and female, from pre-pregnancy through the early years of parenthood. Using advanced neuroimaging techniques and standardized psychological assessments, we will track the development of caregiving behaviors and their neural correlates over time.\n\nSubproject 2 will focus on disrupted caregiving, employing a cross-sectional design to investigate the brain and behavioral impacts of two key disruptions: parental sleep deprivation and infant craniofacial abnormalities, specifically cleft lip and palate. By comparing these groups to controls, we aim to identify the neural mechanisms that are particularly sensitive to such disruptions.\n\nFinally, Subproject 3 will integrate the findings from both normal and disrupted caregiving scenarios using advanced computational models. This integrative approach will help us identify the fundamental brain networks and mechanisms that underlie the development of parental caregiving, providing a comprehensive understanding of this critical human behavior.\n\nThis research will not only advance our knowledge of the neural basis of parental caregiving but also offer insights into potential interventions for disrupted caregiving scenarios, ultimately contributing to better outcomes for both parents and infants."

Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving. I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks. Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate. Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting.",
