    "descriptions": [
        "The Regulatory Innovation and Credibility Analysis (RICA) project aims to critically examine and redefine the foundational principles of the European regulatory state. Traditional approaches emphasize arm’s-length governance and regulatory independence, which are believed to enhance credibility by insulating agencies from political influence. However, this insulation has led to non-majoritarianism and a devaluation of democratic processes. Efforts to enhance input legitimacy have been limited, and the prevailing rational-choice framework posits a zero-sum relationship between accountability and autonomy. RICA challenges these assumptions through two interconnected modules. Module 1 investigates the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, hypothesizing that excessive insulation may actually undermine regulatory legitimacy. Using a reputational perspective, this module will test the hypothesis that transparency and engagement can enhance credibility. Module 2 rethinks the concept of accountability, proposing a new theory that views accountability as a mechanism for building reputation. This module will explore how reputation influences the accountability behaviors of both regulatory actors and their overseers, leading to a re-conceptualization of the relationship between accountability and autonomy. By integrating insights from political science, RICA aims to provide a robust framework for designing more effective and legitimate regulatory institutions."

Arm’s length governance and regulatory independence have become the cornerstone normative and institutional design principles of the European regulatory state. Regulatory credibility is premised on agency insulation from politics with major systemic implications in the form of a rise in non-majoritarianism and a parallel devaluation of the political process. Efforts to compensate through alternative sources of input legitimacy have proven challenging. Conceptualised in a rational-choice tradition, accountability is seen to be in a zero-sum relationship with regulatory autonomy. Bolstering accountability is said to threaten autonomy, undermining the system’s normative foundations. Informed by insights from the political science literature on reputation, RICA profoundly questions these assumptions. It does so in two separate and interlocking tracks. Module 1 theorises about, and tests, the established wisdom of a wholesale positive relation between agency insulation and credibility. To the contrary, from a reputational perspective, a strategy of insulation is expected to have a negative effect on regulatory credibility, with overall delegitimising effects. Similarly informed by reputation insights, Module 2 challenges dominant understandings of accountability and puts forward the building blocks of a new theory of public accountability. The module draws out and studies empirically how reputation shapes the accountability behaviour of regulatory actors, both account-holders and account-givers, and their interactions. It will re-conceptualise the role played by accountability in the regulatory state as well as its relationship with autonomy. In contrast to dominant understandings, as a mechanism of reputation-building, accountability can reinforce autonomy with sweeping implications for regulatory control strategies and institutional design choices.",
