    "descriptions": [
        "This research project aims to explore the role of hope, expectation, belief, and trust in late medieval medicine and healing practices, drawing parallels with the modern concept of the placebo effect. By integrating an analysis of intellectual, social, and cultural forces, the project will examine how these sensibilities were articulated and applied in medieval therapeutic encounters. Through a comprehensive examination of ideas, practices, and the organizational structures of healing, the study will highlight the significance of these elements in medieval Southern European medicine. The project will bridge contemporary discussions on the symbolic aspects of therapeutic interventions with historical perceptions of the soul's influence on the body, revealing the pervasive nature of placebo-like sensibilities in medieval healing. It will also uncover the dynamic interplay between theoretical concepts, practical applications, and institutional frameworks that fostered trust and belief in medical treatments. By contextualizing these practices within a broader historical framework, the project will provide valuable insights into the evolution of European medicine and offer a fresh perspective on the challenges facing modern healthcare, such as declining trust in medical services and the complexities of placebo effects in pharmaceutical research. This interdisciplinary approach will contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological and cultural dimensions of healing, both past and present."

The therapeutic power of these sensibilities is recognized today by the modern clustering concept, placebo effect. This integrative project will identify the intellectual, social, and cultural forces in the medieval past that articulated and applied the idea that health may be improved by evoking certain sensibilities. In a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures of healing activity, I analyze the medieval placebo effect as a paradigmatic attribute of the healing of the period. The project brings into dialogue current debates on the curative role of “symbolic aspects of a therapeutic intervention” with medieval perceptions of the soul’s impact on the body. By so doing it will shed new light on the salient engagement of medieval healing practices with hope, expectations, belief, and trust as critical elements of therapy. It will demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities. It will view the breadth of the engagement with the soul/mind as a formative aspect of healing theory and technique, and will show the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in procuring hope, belief, and trust in late medieval Southern European healing. By looking beyond the term to the components that link the phenomena, this historical project will enable the examination of a health system that is simultaneously alien to and part of the underlying legacy of European medicine and will offer a new path for thinking about these issues, essential for effective healthcare. MedPlaceboEffect will thus lay the groundwork for examining the ways these sensibilities are negotiated in the 21st century as healing practices face substantial challenges such as the growing distrust of medical services, and the increasing difficulty of overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research.",
