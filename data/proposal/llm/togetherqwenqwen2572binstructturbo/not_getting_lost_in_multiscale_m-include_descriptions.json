        "The LostInZoom project aims to revolutionize the navigation experience in multi-scale interactive maps by developing a new zooming paradigm centered on the concept of multi-scale visual landmarks, or anchors. Traditional cartographic guidelines, tailored for static, single-scale maps, are inadequate for the dynamic, scale-shifting environment of digital maps. This project seeks to fill this gap by first investigating the cognitive processes involved in navigating multi-scale maps through user experimentation, identifying the visual elements that serve as effective orientation points during zooming. Building on this foundational knowledge, the second phase will focus on the development of advanced cartographic generalization methods to enhance the prominence and consistency of these landmarks across different scales. The final phase will involve the creation of innovative zooming interaction techniques that leverage these enhanced landmarks to facilitate smoother, more intuitive map exploration. The outcomes of this project will not only improve the user experience in everyday map use but also have significant implications for crisis management, where rapid and accurate spatial orientation can be critical."

Past research told us how to design paper topographic maps at a given scale to make them readable and understandable by human users. But these rules/guidelines do not apply anymore, and map designers lack guidelines to make maps that are smooth to explore through scales, and it is common for a multi-scale map user to feel lost for a few seconds after a zooming interaction. The LostInZoom project (Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management) seeks to establish a new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps, based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during the zoom. To achieve this novel zooming paradigm, we need new grounding knowledge on how people perceive and understand interactive multi-scale maps, in order to design maps and interaction that make multi-scale explorations smoother. The LostInZoom project will be based on three main pillars. In the first one, we will explore the cognition of multi-scale interactive maps with an experimentation approach, in order to identify the anchors or landmarks that help a map reader locate himself when zooming. In the second pillar, we will design new cartographic generalisation techniques to derive multi-scale maps that magnify the landmarks that are important for multi-scale exploration. Finally, the third pillar will be dedicated to the design of new zooming interactions that focus on these landmarks to smooth even more the zooming exploration.",
