    "title": "Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity",
    "descriptions": [
        "Pregnancy, a profound endocrine event, instigates significant maternal adaptations, including neural and behavioral changes that persist throughout life. Despite substantial evidence from animal studies, the human brain's response to pregnancy remains largely unexplored. Our preliminary research has revealed that pregnancy induces lasting alterations in brain structure, indicating a significant degree of neuroplasticity. This proposal outlines a comprehensive, innovative research project aimed at elucidating the multifaceted brain changes during and after pregnancy. Specifically, the project will: A) map the structural and functional brain alterations across pregnancy and the postpartum period; B) identify the key endocrine and lifestyle factors driving these changes through a detailed longitudinal assessment; and C) explore the neural mechanisms underlying both adaptive and maladaptive processes, with a focus on cognitive and emotional domains. We hypothesize that pregnancy-induced brain changes not only contribute to postpartum mental health issues and memory problems but also facilitate adaptive functions critical for maternal caregiving. This hypothesis will be tested through a prospective cohort study, which will track women from pre-conception through pregnancy and the postpartum period, integrating advanced neuroimaging techniques with psychological and biomedical assessments. This project has the potential to establish a foundational understanding of pregnancy-related neuroplasticity, offering critical insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of motherhood."

Animal studies have demonstrated reproduction-related neural and behavioral changes that are evident across the lifespan. However, remarkably little is known on the effects of this monumental transition on the human brain. I have previously shown—for the first time—that pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in human brain structure, revealing the existence of a dramatic pregnancy-related neuroplasticity in humans. Building on these results and new pilot data, I propose a cutting-edge research project that aims to A) comprehensively map the changes manifesting in a woman’s brain by tracking core aspects of brain anatomy and function across pregnancy and the postpartum period, B) pinpoint key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity by means of an extensive profile of endocrine and lifestyle changes, and C) reveal the neural substrates for potential adaptive and maladaptive processes, focusing on specific functional domains highlighted by promising pilot results. I postulate that pregnancy-related changes in a woman’s brain not only underlie well-known adverse peripartum processes such as the development of mental health disorders and memory issues, but also comprise adaptive processes conferring long-lasting changes in specific domains of functioning that play a key role in—but are not restricted to—maternal caregiving. I will investigate this novel topic by means of an innovative prospective cohort study tracking women from before conception across pregnancy and into the postpartum period, which combines cutting-edge neuroimaging approaches with various psychopedagogic and biomedical measures. The proposed project has the potential to lay a firm foundation for this emerging field of human neuroscience and generate groundbreaking insights into a woman’s remarkable neurobiological journey to motherhood.",
