        "**Abstract:**\n\nHealth inequality, a significant societal issue, is often rooted in childhood and can persist across generations. Childhood represents a critical period of rapid development, where adversities can have profound and lasting impacts on health. However, current research predominantly focuses on social adversity, neglecting the intersecting biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental adversities that disadvantaged children face. To address this gap, the LAYERS project aims to develop a comprehensive data infrastructure that integrates multiple layers of childhood adversity across 2 million individuals spanning three generations. By merging advanced data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a novel complex systems framework, LAYERS will systematically investigate the patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of health inequality that originate in early life and persist over time. Furthermore, the project will establish a real-world policy data lab to integrate findings from nationwide policies and simulations, translating research insights into actionable public health strategies. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of health inequality, enabling the identification of vulnerable children and families who can benefit from targeted interventions to break the cycle of adversity."

Childhood is a sensitive period with rapid growth and development, and adversity during this period may have long-lasting health effects. More importantly, multiple forms of adversity intersect with each other, and disadvantaged children are often exposed to adversity across multiple biological, health, social, neighbourhood and environmental layers, but the childhood adversity literature has almost exclusively focused on social adversity. This is a major gap in our understanding, and empirical data which transcends multitude layers of adversity and follows individuals over entire life courses or across generations is lacking. With LAYERS, I am in a unique position to meet this challenge by creating a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of multiple layers of childhood adversity in 2M people over three generations combined with an interdisciplinary fusion of methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a newly developed complex systems framework. This innovative combination of data and methods will allow for a systematic generation of knowledge on the patterns of health inequality that emerge in early life and transcend generations, the mechanisms which generate these patterns, and the dynamics that make them change over time. To translate these insights into actionable public health, LAYERS will establish a real-world policy data lab which integrates evidence from nationwide policies and simulations. Combined, these interconnected elements will redirect the next frontier in health inequality research towards the multiple layers of adversity which generate inequality over the life course and across generations. Ultimately, this will help us break vicious circles of adversity by identifying children and families who would benefit from targeted support.",
