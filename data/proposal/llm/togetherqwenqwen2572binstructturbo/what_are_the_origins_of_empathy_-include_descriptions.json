    "descriptions": [
        "Empathy, the ability to share and understand the emotions and thoughts of others, is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction. Despite its significance, the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, and the extent to which it is a uniquely human trait, remain poorly understood. The EMPORIGIN project aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative study of empathy in human infants and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Using a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, alongside longitudinal observations and innovative experimental designs, EMPORIGIN will explore the early manifestations of empathy in both species. The project will collect rich datasets on bonobo infants in both wild and semi-captive settings, and compare these with data from human infants in two traditional societies—Vanuatu and Samoa—known for their distributed-caregiving practices but differing in societal structure and emotional expressivity. By adopting a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN seeks to test the hypothesis that while humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, humans exhibit a greater motivation to alleviate others' emotional distress and a unique ability for reciprocal emotional exchange. These findings are expected to provide groundbreaking insights into the evolutionary and developmental roots of empathy, challenging current views on its human uniqueness and advancing our understanding of the biological and cultural factors that shape this essential social capacity."

However, we lack knowledge about the origins of empathy and to what extent its sub-components reflect species and cultural universals. Studying infants and great apes enables us to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy and the extent of its human uniqueness. Until now, it has largely been assumed that infants and great apes lack the capacity for empathy. However, this claim may reflect a lack of adequate methodologies and research attention, leaving infant and great ape empathy underestimated. Now, combining novel techniques to investigate empathy comparatively (thermal-imaging, pupillometry and eye-tracking) with longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, EMPORIGIN will overcome this issue to provide the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Rich datasets on bonobo (wild and semi-captive) infant development and caregiver interactions will be compared to those from human infants in two small-scale, traditional societies – Vanuatu and Samoa. Both societies show distributed-caregiving but vary in societal structure and emotional expressivity. Using a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN will deliver step-change insights into empathy development that go far beyond the State-of-the-Art. We will test the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in a greater motivation to ameliorate others’ emotional states and a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. These capacities could lead to a cascade of human-unique forms of sharing and co-operation. Combining approaches across biology, psychology, ethology and anthropology, EMPORIGIN will advance our understanding of the origins of empathy, one of our most remarkable capacities, and challenge current perspectives about its human uniqueness.",
