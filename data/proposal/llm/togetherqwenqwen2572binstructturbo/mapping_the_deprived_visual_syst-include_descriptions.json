        "The MADVIS project aims to explore the complex interplay between crossmodal plasticity and sight restoration in individuals who have experienced visual deprivation. By focusing on the occipital cortex, a region traditionally associated with visual processing, we seek to uncover how this brain area adapts to non-visual stimuli and how such adaptations influence the potential for sight recovery. Our primary objectives are twofold: first, to elucidate the changes in functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex following visual deprivation at various developmental stages; and second, to leverage this knowledge to predict and enhance outcomes of sight restoration procedures. Employing an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that integrates cognitive neuroscience and ophthalmology, MADVIS will not only deepen our understanding of brain plasticity but also provide critical insights for developing more effective strategies for sensory restoration. This research has the potential to revolutionize pre-restoration assessments and treatments, ultimately improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals."

These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity, classically considered compensatory, inevitably raise crucial challenges for sight-restoration. The neglected relation between crossmodal plasticity and sight-recovery will represent the testing ground of MADVIS in order to gain important novel insights on how specific brain regions become, stay and change their functional tuning toward the processing of specific stimuli. The main goal of MADVIS is therefore to make a breakthrough on two fronts: (1) understanding how visual deprivation at different sensitive periods in development affects the functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex; and (2) use the fundamental knowledge derived from (1) to test and predict the outcome of sight restoration. Using a pioneering interdisciplinary approach that crosses the boundaries between cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, MADVIS will have a large impact on our understanding of how experience at different sensitive periods shapes the response properties of specific brain regions. Finally, in its attempt to fill the existing gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, MADVIS will eventually pave the way for a new generation of predictive surveys prior to sensory restoration.",
