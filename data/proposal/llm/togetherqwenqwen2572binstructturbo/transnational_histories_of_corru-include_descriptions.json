        "Between 1750 and 1850, South-East-Central Europe was frequently depicted by both local and foreign observers as a region rife with corruption, characterized by widespread graft, nepotism, and bribery. These portrayals, often leveraged for political and personal gains, linked \"corruption\" to the area's perceived cultural and economic backwardness. TransCorr aims to explore the historical evolution of the concept of \"corruption\" in this region, examining how modern European ideas influenced regional leaders to reframe traditional practices as corrupt. The project will investigate how Great Power interventions in these borderlands further embedded these new definitions, often associating them negatively with the Ottoman legacy. By reconstructing this narrative, TransCorr will uncover the genealogy of ideas and discourses that continue to shape contemporary discussions about the region. This research not only integrates the study of South-East-Central Europe into a broader narrative of modernization but also offers fresh perspectives on patronage and graft, enhancing our understanding of center-periphery dynamics within and beyond the continent."

A wide range of foreign observers portrayed graft, nepotism, and bribery as endemic. Indigenous critics echoed many of these assessments. Regional insiders and outsiders alike mobilized commentaries on “corruption” for their own political, professional, and personal ends, claiming they could run more honest and efficient administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations than those in power. These notables linked “corruption” to the region's supposed cultural backwardness and economic under-development. In doing so, public figures naturalized notions of “corruption,” making it appear both widespread and organic in the region—popularizing tropes that have endured right down to the present. Yet, “corruption” is a historically specific concept. TransCorr seeks to construct a history of the idea of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe in conjunction with the rise of modernity. It demonstrates how in the context of new ideas about modernity emanating from West Europe, regional leaders reframed a host of traditional customs and practices as corrupt. It examines how Great Power attempts to transform these borderlands into formal and informal imperial provinces further entrenched novel understandings of “corruption”, often pejoratively associating them with the Ottoman legacy. By tracing out this history, TransCorr reveals a genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes that continue to inform analyses of and discussions within the region today. The project brings the study of this geographic area into greater dialogue with a global story of modernization and aligns the region’s historiography with new innovations in the scientific literature. It also reframes contemporary debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigures broader understandings of center-periphery relations within the region and across the continent.",
