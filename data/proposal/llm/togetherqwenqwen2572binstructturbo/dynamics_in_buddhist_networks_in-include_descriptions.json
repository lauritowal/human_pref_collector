        "This grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate dynamics of cultural and religious interactions in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia, a region spanning from the Taklamakan Desert to Northeast China. Historically, this area served as a critical nexus for the exchange of ideas, cultures, and religions, particularly along the Silk Road. Buddhism played a pivotal role in these exchanges, facilitating the transmission of cultural elements and religious practices across diverse ethnic and linguistic boundaries. The project focuses on the period between the 6th and 14th centuries, during which local forms of Buddhism emerged and evolved, reflecting the unique cultural and social contexts of the region.\n\nBy integrating multiple disciplines such as Philology, Art History, Archaeology, and Religious Studies, the project seeks to construct a novel, trans-regional, and trans-cultural perspective on the religious transfer in Eastern Central Asia. This approach will facilitate a deeper understanding of the complex networks and relationships that developed between major trans-regional Buddhist traditions (Chinese, Indian, Tibetan) and local Buddhist cultures (Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, Kitan). The research will not only enrich the field of Comparative Religious Studies but also provide a more nuanced and holistic view of the historical and cultural landscape/*@*/ of Eastern Central Asia."

This region was the crossroads of ancient civilisations. Its uniqueness was determined by complex dynamics of religious and cultural exchanges gravitating around an ancient communication artery, known as the Silk Road. Buddhism was one major factor in this exchange; its transfer predetermined the transfer of adjacent aspects of culture. The religious exchange involved a variety of cultures and civilisations, which were modified and shaped by their adoption of Buddhism. This process overrode the ethnic and linguistic boundaries of the Buddhist universe. One specific aspect of this process was the rise of the local forms of Buddhism. This project intends to investigate such Buddhist localisations between the 6th–14th centuries. I will create a new trans-regional and trans-cultural vision of the religious transfer in Eastern Central Asian history and will reconstruct this Buddhist network with its entities and relations. It will incorporate the fascinating, but as yet under-researched field of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into a broader research agenda of Comparative Religious Studies. It will establish a new research approach by bringing together many research fields and agendas (such as Philology, Art History, Archaeology, Religious Studies) into one synthesising narrative based on a unique perspective, in which, religious exchange in Eastern Central Asia will be analysed as a dynamic network emerging in its spatial and temporal aspects. For the first time the multi-layered relationships between the trans-regional Buddhist traditions (Chinese, Indian, Tibetan) and those based on local Buddhist cultures (Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, Kitan) will be explored in a systematic way.",
