        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe COMMIOS project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) through an unprecedented integration of cutting-edge ancient DNA and isotope analysis within a comprehensive interdisciplinary framework. This project will conduct the first large-scale genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations, examining approximately 1000 individuals in the UK and 250 in Europe. By mapping genetic clusters, we aim to reveal the genetic structure of these ancient communities and their connections to modern genetic patterns. Complementing this with isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological, and cultural archaeological approaches, we will explore critical issues such as population movement, inter-regional connectivity, and social dynamics. Specifically, we will investigate household and kin-group composition, familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the emergence of social inequalities. This project, led by a team of world-renowned experts in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, and cultural archaeology, will set a new standard for archaeological research, providing a detailed and nuanced view of Iron Age Britain within its broader European context. The results will not only enhance our knowledge of this specific period but also establish a benchmark for future studies in other regions and periods."

COMMIOS integrates these cutting-edge methods on a scale not previously attempted, within a ground-breaking interdisciplinary framework, to provide a radically new vision of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) within their wider European context. At the broad scale, we will conduct the first concerted programme of genome-wide ancient DNA analysis on Iron Age populations anywhere in the world (c. 1000 individuals in the UK, 250 in Europe), mapping genetic clusters to shed light on ancient populations themselves and on their relationships to modern genetic patterning. Together with isotope analysis, and underpinned by both osteoarchaeological and cultural archaeological approaches, this will also enable us to directly address critical issues of population movement and inter-regional connectivity in Iron Age Europe. We will utilise the power of these new scientific methods to examine the structure and social dynamics of Iron Age societies in Britain, including household and kin-group composition, the identification of familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. Previously the preserve of cultural anthropologists studying recent societies, we will draw these questions into the archaeological domain, opening up new areas of enquiry for prehistoric societies. The scope and scale of the project represents a new departure for European archaeology, made possible by the coming-of-age of new analytical methods. Many of these have been pioneered by the project team, which comprises world-leaders in the fields of ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling and cultural archaeology. Although focussed on Iron Age Britain, the project will establish a new benchmark for future analyses of other regions and periods in Europe and beyond.",
