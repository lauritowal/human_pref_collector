        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of advanced technologies on corporate governance, investor behavior, and employee compensation, with a focus on three key areas: shareholder communication, environmental and social (ES) responsibility, and equity-based compensation (EBC) in the tech industry. Specifically, the study will investigate how the transition from in-person to virtual shareholder meetings has affected shareholder engagement and firm transparency. Preliminary findings suggest that virtual meetings may reduce the effectiveness of shareholder communication, allowing firms to sidestep critical questions. Additionally, the project will employ natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the discrepancy between firms' stated and actual commitments to ES issues, revealing that the market may reward firms for their rhetoric rather than their actions. Lastly, the research will examine the relationship between employee characteristics, such as gender, and the distribution and value maximization of EBC in the tech sector, with implications for economic equity and individual welfare. Through these interconnected analyses, the study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the technological transformations shaping modern corporate practices and their broader societal impacts."

Technology is changing how investors interact with companies, how investors analyze and interpret the information provided by companies, and even the standard design of compensation in corporations. The goal of this study is to understand whether and how the increasing presence of technology is improving corporations and contributing to the wealth and prosperity of individuals/ investors, and when it is not. I will focus on the following three pillars that each focus on a unique technological development: (1) Communication with shareholders. Aim: To understand whether shareholders’ voice at shareholder meetings is muted following the shift of shareholder meetings from the in-person to the virtual-only arena (due to Covid-19). Initial findings indicate that this shift has minimized communication between shareholders and firms and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing questions submitted by shareholders. (2) Environment and social (ES) issues. Aim: To understand whether investors pay attention to what firms say they do on ES issues, or what they actually do. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to evaluate which actions firms state that they take with respect to ES, and these will be compared to the ES actions firms actually take. Initial results indicate that the market rewards firms that state they take actions promoting ES goals, but not firms that actually take such actions. (3) Compensation. – Aim: To examine how the characteristics of employees (e.g., gender) working in the tech industry relate to the EBC they receive, and their ability to maximize the value of their EBC and changes the economic landscape and welfare of individuals.",
