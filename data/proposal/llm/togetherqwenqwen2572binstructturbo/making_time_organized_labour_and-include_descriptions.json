        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the role of trade unions in shaping national leave policies that support work-life balance, focusing on the provision of time-off for family care and personal well-being. Despite the growing emphasis on sustainable work practices, there is significant variation across countries in the availability and effectiveness of such policies. Given that women often bear the primary responsibility for caregiving and now make up a substantial portion of union membership, this project will employ a mixed-methods approach to analyze the relationship between organized labor and care-related leave policies. The quantitative component will assess union-policy dynamics across developed democracies from 1965 to the present, while the qualitative aspect will delve into the policy advocacy efforts of unions in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. By examining various types of social provisions, the project will consider how union characteristics and the demographics of their membership influence policy outcomes. Additionally, it will explore the mechanisms through which unions exert their influence and how these dynamics differ across institutional settings. The aim is to bridge the fields of comparative policy analysis and social movement research, contributing to a deeper understanding of union-policy relationships and advancing theories in labor studies. The project will also develop comprehensive, longitudinal data sets on care leave provisions, providing valuable resources for future research and policy development. Ultimately, this research seeks to determine the potential of trade unions as key partners in fostering social policies that enhance work-life balance and support sustainable employment practices."

Social policies that make time for family and self-care are important tools for building sustainable work, but countries vary considerably in the extent to which such tools are available. Trade union organizations may play an important role for developing statutory care-related leave rights and protections, particularly as women still provide a bulk of family caregiving and now constitute a majority or near-majority of union members in many countries. This project will use a novel mixed-method design to investigate organized labour’s relationships to national leave policies that grant time-off from work to address care needs, including leave to care for a child, aging parent, or ill spouse or to address self-care needs through sick leave or disability benefits. Quantitative analyses will examine union-policy relationships across rich democracies starting in 1965, and qualitative analyses will examine organized labour’s policy advocacy in Ireland, France and the Netherlands. Analyses of predictors will distinguish between different types of social provisions, consider differences in trade unions and the types of workers they represent, investigate the mechanisms of potential union influence over policy, and compare union-policy relationships across different institutional contexts. A central ambition is to integrate the interdisciplinary fields of comparative policy analysis and social movement research to advance comparative labour studies and develop new theories of union-policy relationships. The project will additionally develop data infrastructures, offering much-needed longitudinal, comparative data on different types of care leave provisions. Overall, the project will assess the extent to which organized labour can be a partner for developing social policies that promote sustainable work for the future.",
