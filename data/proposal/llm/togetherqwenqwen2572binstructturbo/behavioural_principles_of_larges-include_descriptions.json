        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research initiative aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding human cooperation, crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. Current models in social sciences, while useful, often focus narrowly on specific behavioral aspects, failing to capture the full spectrum of human motivations. Our project, PRINCIPLES, integrates insights and methodologies from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to create a unified and experimentally validated model of cooperation. We will first explore rule-following behavior, a foundational element of large-scale cooperation, to develop and test a robust model. Subsequently, we will investigate the interconnections between various behavioral principles, drawing from diverse social science disciplines. This model will be applied to analyze key social dilemmas, offering new perspectives on well-established theories. Finally, we will conduct incentivized experiments with representative samples from major global economies to understand how people behave in critical large-scale cooperation scenarios, particularly in climate action. PRINCIPLES will provide researchers and policymakers with a powerful interdisciplinary toolkit to address complex cooperation challenges, enhancing our ability to foster collective action for a sustainable future."

A failure to cooperate, that is, to act in one’s self-interest rather than the collective interest, could spell a bleak future for humanity. When are people prepared to play their part in the solution of these fundamental problems? Current behavioural models of cooperation from across the social sciences, including economics, are inadequate for answering this fundamental question, because they typically focus on one narrow aspect of people’s behaviour, but people might be motivated by different factors at the same time. Hence, to make progress, an integrated approach is needed. The major ambition of my interdisciplinary research programme is to achieve synergy by combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology into a novel experimentally tested framework thereby making a major step forward in the creation of a unified science of human cooperation. Rule following is the most basic behaviour to achieve large-scale cooperation. I will use it as a first step to develop, and experimentally test a comprehensive model of behavioural principles of cooperation. Second, I will then employ the framework to systematically investigate behavioural links between previously disjointed behavioural principles as developed across the social sciences. I also use the model to provide comprehensive new behavioural analyses of the most important models of social dilemmas. Finally, I will use the new framework in representative samples from major economies around the globe to explain people’s behaviour in relevant large-scale cooperation problems, most importantly caring for the climate, by using incentivised experiments. PRINCIPLES will equip researchers and policy makers across disciplines with behavioural principles, tools and data to study problems of cooperation using an interdisciplinary and experimentally tested framework.",
