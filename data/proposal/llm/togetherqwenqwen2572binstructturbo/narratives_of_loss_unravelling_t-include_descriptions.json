        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe LOSS project seeks to explore the complex interplay between economic hardship and the increasing support for socially conservative political agendas that aim to restrict the rights of marginalized groups, including ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities, migrants, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and women. This phenomenon has been observed in several European countries, where financial crises have often coincided with a surge in far-right political movements. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship remain poorly understood. By integrating insights from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics, the LOSS project proposes a novel theoretical framework that posits that economic hardship leads to narratives of loss, which in turn fuel support for socially conservative political ideologies. To test this framework, the project will employ a multi-method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to analyze data from five European countries—France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—each with varying levels of economic support systems. The study will also examine local contexts within these countries to understand how policy environments influence the relationship between economic hardship and political attitudes. This research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to social fragmentation and political polarization in Europe, ultimately informing more effective policy interventions."

Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",
