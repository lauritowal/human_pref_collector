    "descriptions": [
        "This research project aims to reassess the fundamental questions of international trade and welfare in the context of firm heterogeneity, which has become increasingly relevant due to rising protectionism and nationalism. By challenging the assumptions of conventional trade models that assume homogenous firms, the project seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of trade dynamics. The project is structured into four integrated work packages. The first work package will explore the impact of firm heterogeneity on market allocative efficiency, particularly in the presence of pricing distortions, and assess whether economic integration mitigates or exacerbates allocative inefficiencies. The second work package will delve into the theoretical implications of firm heterogeneity for the design of optimal multilateral trade policies, focusing on cooperative frameworks that enhance joint welfare among trade partners. The third work package will examine the interactions between country, sector, and firm characteristics, and how these interactions shape national responses to trade liberalization. Finally, the fourth work package will analyze the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping a country's export capabilities, specifically through the productivity distribution of its firms. Together, these work packages aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between firm heterogeneity and international trade."

Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? Should governments intervene to promote or restrict international transactions? Questions like these have recently gained new salience, in Europe and elsewhere, due to renewed protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies arising from diffuse disenchantment with globalization. The aim of the research project is to highlighting key dimensions along which the answers to these questions obtained from conventional trade models with homogenous firms should be revisited in the light of permanent pervasive firm heterogeneity. In particular, the project will pursue four specific objectives through four integrated work packages providing new insights on how firm heterogeneity affects: (1) the ability of markets to deliver allocative efficiency; (2) The design of optimal multilateral trade policies; (3) The comparative advantages of countries; (4) The capabilities of a country as an exporter. The first work package will investigate whether the allocative inefficiency (“misallocation”) determined by firm heterogeneity in the presence of pricing distortions is quantitatively relevant for a country’s aggregate economic performance, and whether economic integration reduces or exacerbates such misallocation. The second work package will develop the theoretical implications of firm heterogeneity for trade policy, with special emphasis on the cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements aimed at maximizing the joint welfare of all trade partners. The third work package will study how country, sector and firm characteristics interact to determine countries’ responses to trade liberalization. The fourth work package will investigate the distinct role of firm heterogeneity in determining a country’s ability to export through the shape of the productivity distribution of its producers.",
