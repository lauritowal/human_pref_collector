        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe PRIMERS project aims to elucidate the conditions that fostered the emergence of innovative behaviors, particularly the creation and use of sharp stone tools, which marked a pivotal divergence in human evolutionary history. This groundbreaking research will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating behavioral studies, cognitive science, and advanced modeling techniques to uncover the cognitive and developmental prerequisites for innovation. Specifically, PRIMERS will investigate the stone manipulation capabilities of three primate species—wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques—using novel artificial intelligence coding methods to establish a baseline for tool-making behaviors. The project will then explore the roles of exposure and experience in driving innovation through a large-scale, controlled experimental paradigm involving 350 subjects over four years. Finally, PRIMERS will compare the resulting primate tool assemblages with some of the earliest known human stone tools, leveraging Structural Equation Models to analyze the relative contributions and interactions of the identified factors. By systematically investigating these elements, PRIMERS seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the precursors to human culture and the unique cognitive capacities that set humans apart from other primates."

By identifying the conditions driving innovations across primates, we can provide new insight into when and how humans developed this unique culture. PRIMERS will address this need by adopting a systematic and holistic approach to testing the catalysts of a watershed behaviour in our evolutionary history: the ability to make and use sharp stone tools (flakes). The advent of intentional flakes in the human lineage marks the first clear divergence between animal and human technology. With tools to access high-value calories, our ancestors now had the physical and cognitive resources to lay the groundwork for our culture. PRIMERS will use a triangulation approach to follow the emergence of flaking in appropriate proxy models: wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. Objective 1 will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of these species using novel artificial intelligence coding methods. Objective 2 will test two other major drivers of innovations: exposure and experience. An experimental paradigm with in-built controls, large sample sizes (N =350), and long-term testing protocols (approx. 4 years) will be used to empirically evaluate the cognitive and developmental primers of innovations. Objective 3 will systematically compare primate assemblages to some of the oldest human stone tools, allowing for inferences to be made on when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Structural Equation Models will then determine the relative contributions and interactions between the measured factors. By testing three species, combining and upscaling experimental paradigms and implementing powerful modelling tools, PRIMERS will radically enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations, and with it, the primers of human culture.",
