        "This research project aims to explore the origins of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties through the lens of the Spanish colonization of Latin America, treating it as a natural experiment. Unlike many historical events used in comparative politics and development studies, the Spanish colonization presents a unique \"bundle treatment\" where various factors such as legal origin, human capital, and institutional structures were simultaneously introduced. To address the complexities of disentangling these factors, this study focuses on the initial years of Spanish colonization, a period when the conquistadors had limited knowledge of the territories they were to conquer. This approach offers several methodological advantages. First, by concentrating on the early colonization phase, the study can isolate the impact of initial institutional design on long-term political and economic outcomes. Second, the involvement of a single colonial power, Spain, eliminates the confounding effects of diverse legal origins. Third, the detailed “Capitulaciones” contracts and other archival documents from the Archivo de Indias provide rich data on the rules and regulations that governed the early colonial institutions, including taxation, governance, military power, and the treatment of indigenous populations. Finally, these documents offer precise subnational data on the locations of initial settlements, allowing for a nuanced analysis of how specific institutional arrangements influenced local development. This project aims to leverage this unique dataset to advance our understanding of how early colonial institutions shaped the trajectory of state capacity and political structures in Latin America."

Much of the recent work on comparative politics and development uses large historical events as fruitful experimentation laboratories. However, the colonial experience looks more similar to a \"bundle treatment\" than a single treatment. It is difficult to disentangle the role of differences in legal origin from the influences of human capital, etc. To try to overcome this problem, past empirical approaches use a variety of methods like case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables. I will try to move one step further in this debate by considering the initial years of the Spanish colonization of Latin America as a natural experiment. My methodological approach has four advantages. First, since I only analyse the initial years of colonization, my empirical strategy is based on the fact that the initial conquerors had no knowledge of the land that they intended to conquer. The second advantage is that, in working with the colonization of Latin America, we only have one colonial power, Spain, which avoids the traditional problems of diversity of legal origins. The third advantage is that the contracts (“Capitulaciones”), that the conquerors signed with the King before embarking to America, and before even knowing anything about the land that he would conquer, and other documents from the Archivo de Indias, provide very rich details on the rules that governed the early institutions (power to tax and rule, the use of military power, the treatment of indigenous groups, etc.). Finally, these documents contain information to locate the initial settlements at the subnational level. The colonization of the Americas and the information contained in the “Capitulaciones” found in the Archivo de Indias provides a unique opportunity to advance the debate on these crucial questions.",
