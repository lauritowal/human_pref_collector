        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe BabMed project aims to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science, drawing from the largest ancient medical data collection predating Hippocratic texts. This initiative will systematically examine the latest phase of Babylonian medicine, preserved in Aramaic within the Babylonian Talmud, in conjunction with earlier cuneiform materials. Current medical histories often overlook Babylonian contributions due to the inaccessibility of cuneiform texts and the neglect of Aramaic medical knowledge in the Talmud. BabMed will test the hypotheses that cuneiform writing persisted longer than previously thought and that much of the Aramaic medicine in the Talmud originates from Akkadian traditions. By employing native taxonomies instead of modern biomedical classifications, the project will avoid retrospective misdiagnoses and provide a more accurate understanding of ancient medical practices. Comparative analyses with neighboring medical systems will challenge Eurocentric views, which typically privilege Greek medicine. BabMed seeks to establish a new paradigm for knowledge transfer, recognizing the linguistic and script barriers that ancient medical traditions faced and how they were bridged, particularly through the preservation of Babylonian medical knowledge in the Aramaic language of the Babylonian Talmud."

The latest phase of Babylonian medicine, as preserved in Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud, has never been systematically studied in the light of older cuneiform materials. The absence of accessible cuneiform medical literature has forced recent medical histories to bypass Babylonian medicine, while Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has simply been ignored. BabMed tests a number of 'high risk' propositions, including two key hypotheses: 1) cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected, and 2) Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. BabMed's methodology relies upon native taxonomies rather than modern biomedical disease classifications, countering flawed retrospective diagnoses that obviate the entire history of medicine. Comparisons with neighbouring medical systems challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories, in which Greek medicine has become the standard for all ancient medicine. BabMed will introduce a new paradigm for knowledge transfer which will recognise the barriers between ancient arts of medicine and how they were overcome in antiquity. One such barrier was script and language, and BabMed proposes that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text which straddles the borders of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia and mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds.",
