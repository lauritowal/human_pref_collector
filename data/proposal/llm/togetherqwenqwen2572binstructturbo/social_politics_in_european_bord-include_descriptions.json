    "descriptions": [
        "This project aims to reevaluate the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by highlighting the pivotal role of local actors—families and associations—in shaping welfare systems across three European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. By examining the period from the late 19th century to the 1990s, we will explore the dynamic interactions between local and state actors, focusing on areas where the influence of central governments often waned, leading to the emergence of diverse local welfare structures. These structures were often based on a mix of national and non-national identities, such as occupation and religion, creating a rich tapestry of social provision. Our study will investigate the intricate relationships between inclusion and exclusion in welfare systems, particularly in contexts where multiple forms of social care competed. Through comparative and transnational frameworks, we will analyze the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across these borderlands, identifying both commonalities and differences. This historical analysis will provide valuable insights into the broader development of welfare in Europe, offering a nuanced perspective that can inform contemporary debates about welfare reform, especially in light of ongoing discussions about social rights and their implications for European societies."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",
