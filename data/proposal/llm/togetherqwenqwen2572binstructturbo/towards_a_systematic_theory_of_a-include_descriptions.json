        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe STARTDIALOG project aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams, which have played a significant role in philosophy, logic, and various interdisciplinary fields. Despite their historical and practical importance, these diagrams often suffer from a lack of clarity and understanding, limiting their heuristic potential. To address this, the project will employ a novel research strategy by creating a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams, informed by a comprehensive database of existing and new diagrams. This typology will serve as a foundational resource, akin to the periodic table in chemistry, organizing and clarifying the logical properties and applications of these diagrams. By resolving the issues surrounding their use, the project will enhance the methodological understanding of Aristotelian diagrams and establish them as objects of independent study within logical geometry. The impact of this work will extend beyond logical geometry, benefiting philosophical logicians, philosophers, and researchers across disciplines who utilize Aristotelian diagrams in their work on logical reasoning."

Nowadays, they also have several applications in other disciplines that are concerned with logical reasoning, such as psychology, linguistics and computer science. However, many of the applications of Aristotelian diagrams suffer from substantial problems, often due to a lack of understanding of the intricate logical properties of these diagrams. Consequently, the tremendous heuristic potential of Aristotelian diagrams has remained vastly underappreciated thus far. The overarching goal of the STARTDIALOG project is to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams. We will use a radically new research strategy to accomplish this goal, viz. developing a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams in close interplay with a comprehensive diagram database. This empirically informed typology will systematically organize all our (existing and new) knowledge about Aristotelian diagrams, similarly to the role of Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements in chemistry. This will enable us to clarify and solve many of the issues that currently surround the applications of these diagrams, and thereby lead to a more accurate understanding of their methodological importance. This unified theory will allow us to move beyond the specific details of any given application, and to study Aristotelian diagrams as objects of independent interest. This will constitute a major breakthrough in logical geometry, i.e. the theoretical investigation of Aristotelian diagrams. However, because of the widely interdisciplinary use of these diagrams, the scientific impact of the STARTDIALOG project will reach far beyond the boundaries of logical geometry: its results will be relevant for other philosophical logicians as well, for philosophers in general, and ultimately, for all researchers who make use of Aristotelian diagrams in their research on logical reasoning.",
