        "The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) project seeks to explore the emergence, evolution, and contestation of norms within the highly contentious domain of climate change-related loss and damage. Despite the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognizing the urgent need to address the irreversible consequences of climate change, significant ambiguity persists regarding the implications and responsibilities of loss and damage policies. This project employs an interdisciplinary approach, integrating theories from international relations and political science, to investigate the dynamic processes through which norms related to climate justice are formed and contested. By adopting an ethnographic methodology that spans multiple levels of governance, CCLAD will provide a nuanced understanding of the conditions under which norms gain traction, influence, or face resistance. The research will delve into the micro-politics of international negotiations and the implementation of loss and damage policies, while also conducting cross-national comparative studies on domestic policy practices. This dual focus will illuminate how policy-making and implementation practices at both international and national levels shape the trajectory of climate justice norms. Additionally, CCLAD will contribute methodologically by advancing the use of political ethnography and \"practice-tracing\" techniques, offering new tools for analyzing the fluid nature of normative content in global governance."

Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction; non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty); finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and “practice-tracing” methods.",
