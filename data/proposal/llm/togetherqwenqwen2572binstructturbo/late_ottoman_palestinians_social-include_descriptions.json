    "title": "Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920",
    "descriptions": [
        "This project explores the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine during the transformative period from 1880 to 1920, a time marked by imperialism, globalization, and Ottoman state-building. By focusing on individual and collective coping strategies employed by Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class lines, the research aims to uncover the mechanisms through which social formations emerged and evolved. Central to this investigation is the analysis of census-taking as a social process, which will provide crucial data for understanding how individuals and communities navigated the challenges of the era, such as economic stress and social mobility. The project will establish methodological standards for comparative social and cultural history, contributing to the broader effort to write a global history of the period. By developing a theoretical framework and utilizing census data, the research will set new benchmarks for Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) studies of the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, the project will offer new insights into the study of colonialism, particularly during the British Mandate, by enabling comparisons with other historical sources."

Therefore, in this period we find the roots of many social formations that have remained relevant until the present. My focus is on the individual and collective practices for coping with various challenges and on census-taking as a social process. It will open up new perspectives on social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine, in a historical context defined by European imperialism, Ottoman state building and globalisation. The main research question is: which social strategies did late Ottoman Palestinians employ, across ethnic, religious and class divides, to confront challenges on the individual and collective levels? These include fostering social advancement of oneâ€™s household or coping with economic stress. My hypothesis is that an accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. Using the census process and its data I will establish yardsticks that will make it possible to compare social practices across the region and beyond, and thus contribute to ongoing efforts to write a global social and cultural history and it will develop a theoretical framework and methodological standards that will be useful for similar research projects. Specifically, the project aims to set new standards for how to realise the vision of an HGIS for the entire Ottoman Empire. Enabling comparison with other sources it may also offer intriguing new perspectives for the study of colonialism, notably under the British Mandate.",
