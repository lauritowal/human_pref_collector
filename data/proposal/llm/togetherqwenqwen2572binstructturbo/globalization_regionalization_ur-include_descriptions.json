        "The \"World Seastems\" project seeks to pioneer the mapping of the world economy’s maritime dynamics over a 300-year span, leveraging underutilized vessel movement records dating back to 1734. This ambitious endeavor has three primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to create the first comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive map of maritime flows, spanning nearly three centuries. This geomatics visualization platform will incorporate advanced analytical tools to simplify complex shipping routes and extract valuable insights, serving both scientific research and educational purposes. Secondly, the project will delve into the topological and spatial structure of the global inter-port network, applying principles from graph theory, social network analysis, and complex network science. By comparing the network’s global properties with established models, the project will explore how macroscopic network measures have evolved in response to major historical events such as world wars, revolutions, and economic crises. Additionally, the project will identify coherent substructures within the network, such as clusters of ports and regional economies, to better understand the emergence of world regions and processes of regional integration, as well as the influence of global powers. Lastly, the project will investigate the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development, examining the growth of port cities and their hinterlands, as well as the interconnectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. This analysis will be enriched by integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics, providing a holistic view of the interplay between maritime activity and regional development."

It will exploit untapped vessel movement data available since 1734, date of the first Lloyd's List register. There are three main goals of the project. First, it aims at mapping for the first time the spatial distribution of almost 300 years of maritime flows in a dynamic and interactive manner. A geomatics visualisation platform will also integrate advanced analytical tools to simplify the pattern of shipping routes and corridors, and to extract meaningful information from the original data, with both scientific and pedagogical outcomes. Second, the project will look at the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links with reference to graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks. The global properties of the network can be compared with general models of networks, while the evolution of macroscopic measures will be explored in relation with wider structural and conjectural changes in the world system (e.g. world wars, revolutions, crises) in terms of network expansion, shrinkage, concentration and polarisation. Internally, the search for coherent substructures (i.e. clusters, communities of ports, économies-mondes) will focus on the emergence of world regions and regional integration processes, also as a means revealing spheres of influence of world's main powers. Third, we wish to look at the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development. The evolution of (port) cities and hinterlands as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks are crucial aspects to be explored, benefitting from the integration of other global databases on urban population, trade flows, socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions, etc.",
