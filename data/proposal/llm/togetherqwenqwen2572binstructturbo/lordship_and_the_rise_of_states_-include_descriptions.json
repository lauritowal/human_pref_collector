        "This research project seeks to challenge and refine the prevailing narrative of state formation in Western Europe from 1300 to 1600. Traditionally, this period is seen as a critical era in the development of the modern state, marked by the centralization of fiscal and military power under the authority of princes. However, this project posits that such centralization was not a monolithic process but rather one that involved significant decentralization, particularly through the creation of privately owned seigneuries. These \"states-within-states\" were granted to elites in exchange for their support in state-building efforts. By examining the interplay between central authorities and seigneurial elites in five distinct regions—Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire—the project aims to uncover how fiscal and military centralization was facilitated by a confederal organizational structure. The case studies will explore how variations in state formation, urbanization, rural socio-economic organization, and ideological dissent influenced the relationships between princes and power elites. The outcomes of this research will provide a more nuanced understanding of the social and political dynamics of state formation, offering a new analytical framework that can be applied to the broader European context, including Central and Eastern Europe. This project not only promises to advance the social history of power in Western Europe but also to methodologically integrate the political histories of diverse European regions during this transformative period."

This period is considered as the key phase in the genesis of the modern state, as various polities now centralized fiscal and military resources under their command. While there is debate whether this was primarily a top-down process carried by princes, or a bottom-up process carried by popular representation, scholars agree that state building was exclusively a process of centralization. This assumption must be questioned, as recent studies have raised awkward questions that cannot be answered by the current paradigm. The research hypothesis is that the emerging states of Western Europe could only acquire sufficient support among established elites if they also decentralized much of their legal authority through a process in which princes created a growing number of privately owned seigneuries as “states-within-states” for the benefit of elites who in return contributed to state building. This project will study the interplay between states and seigneurial elites in five regions – Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc and Warwickshire – to test whether fiscal and military centralization was facilitated by a progressively confederal organization of government. Together, the case studies cover four key variables that shaped the relations between princes and power elites in different combinations all over Europe. It concerns different trajectories in 1) state formation, 2) urbanization, 3) the socio-economic organization of rural society and 4) ideological dissent. As a result, the comparisons between the case studies will yield an analytical framework to chart and to explain path-dependency. The project will put the social history of power in Western Europe on a new, improved footing and provide the methodological innovation that is necessary to integrate the political history of Western Europe between1300-1600 with that of Central- and Eastern Europe.",
