        "This grant proposal aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to individual differences in substance use and the risk of abuse, focusing on nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and caffeine. Substance use is widespread, with varying health impacts depending on the substance and the pattern of use. Previous twin studies, including my own, have highlighted the significant roles of both genetic and environmental influences. This project is structured around five primary objectives: 1) to dissect the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to substance use through extended twin family designs; 2) to identify and validate specific genes and gene networks involved in substance use using DNA-variant data; 3) to examine gene expression differences between substance users and non-users using RNA data; 4) to explore biomarkers associated with substance use in blood and urine samples; and 5) to investigate the relationship between substance use and health outcomes by linking twin-family data to national medical databases. The research will leverage the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), including its longitudinal phenotype database and biological samples. With over two decades of experience in data collection, analysis, and behavior genetics, I am well-equipped to lead this advanced project. My team will collect additional essential data, and we will employ state-of-the-art methods to analyze large sample sizes. Collectively, this project will provide robust insights into the genetic and environmental determinants of substance use and the associated risk of abuse."

Substance use is common. Substances like nicotine and cannabis have well-known negative health consequences, while alcohol and caffeine use may be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on quantity and frequency of use. Twin studies (including my own) demonstrated that both heritable and environmental factors play a role. My proposal on substance use (nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and caffeine) is organized around several key objectives: 1. To unravel the complex contribution of genetic and environmental factors to substance use by using extended twin family designs; 2. To identify and confirm genes and gene networks involved in substance use by using DNA-variant data; 3. To explore gene expression patterns with RNA data in substance users versus non-users; 4. To investigate biomarkers in substance users versus non-users using blood or urine; 5. To unravel relation between substance use and health by linking twin-family data to national medical databases. To realize these aims I will use the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR); including both the longitudinal phenotype database and the biological samples. I have been involved in data collection, coordination of data collection and analyzing NTR data since 1999. With my comprehensive experience in data collection, data analyses and my knowledge in the field of behavior genetics and addiction research I will be able to successfully lead this cutting-edge project. Additional data crucial for the project will be collected by my team. Large samples will be available for this study and state-of-the art methods will be used to analyze the data. All together, my project will offer powerful approaches to unravel the complex interaction between genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in substance use and the risk for abuse.",
