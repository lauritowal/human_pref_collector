        "This grant proposal seeks to challenge the prevailing narrative of moral progress, which posits an expanding circle of moral concern from a select few to all humans and, more recently, to non-human animals. While influential, this account faces significant feasibility issues rooted in human evolutionary psychology, such as the parochial nature of empathy and the kin-based nature of altruism. Our project aims to develop a new theory of moral progress by exploring alternative forms of moral development that are not constrained by these evolutionary limits. Through a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from ethics, psychology, and social science, we will identify moral attitudes and institutional mechanisms that can effectively extend moral concern beyond traditional boundaries. This research will not only refine our understanding of moral progress but also offer practical strategies for fostering a more inclusive and just society."

Full moral status was only accorded to people of a certain class, age, gender, ethnicity, or religion. Over time, the moral franchise was gradually extended, however imperfectly, to include human beings of all races, creeds, or genders. Eventually, even species membership is recognized as morally irrelevant, and the moral circle is extended towards non-human animals as well. Many influential ethicists call this the “expanding circle” of moral concern. Moral progress, on this account, consists in further expansions of the moral realm beyond ethically arbitrary features. This account, however, faces a serious feasibility problem: our moral concern is limited due to features of our evolved psychology. Empathy is parochial; altruism remains tied to friends and kin. This project will develop an alternative theory of moral progress. By focusing on different forms of moral progress other than the expanding circle, different moral attitudes which are not subject to the same evolutionary constraints, and smart institutions that can bypass the limits of our inherited psychology, it will be shown that the prospects of moral progress have been severely underestimated.",
