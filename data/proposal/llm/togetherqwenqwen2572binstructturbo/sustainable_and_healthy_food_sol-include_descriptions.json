        "The FLORA project aims to catalyze the transformation of global agri-food systems to achieve sustainability and enhance human health, addressing critical issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and poverty. By integrating health and environmental outcomes, FLORA will diagnose the current state of food systems from both production and consumption angles, employing innovative sustainability metrics. The project will leverage system dynamics and complex network analyses to identify key threats and opportunities. An interdisciplinary modeling framework will be developed to evaluate and target effective solutions, considering trade-offs and synergies within food systems. This global initiative seeks to overcome existing barriers by adopting a systemic approach and fostering a robust, evidence-based research framework. Led by an experienced principal investigator with a strong track record in interdisciplinary agri-food research, FLORA will provide essential insights and actionable strategies to support sustainable and healthy food systems worldwide."

While hunger has receded, food systems are causing increasingly severe damage to our environment and health. The FLORA project will contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption necessary to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems. The project will create essential evidence to identify and implement the shifts in practices and behaviours needed to effectively achieve this transformation, by (1) making a diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, from the production and consumption perspectives, with innovative measures of sustainability, (2) identifying key threats and opportunities with system dynamics and complex network analyses, and (3) targeting and evaluating tailored solutions with an inter-disciplinary modelling framework. The project will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food systems components. Global in scope, it sets the ambitious goal to overcome barriers in current approaches by taking a systemic approach and establishing a robust, interdisciplinary framework supported by empirical advancements to tackle complex food systems challenges. This innovative project builds on the PIâ€™s excellent track record in leading interdisciplinary research focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.",
