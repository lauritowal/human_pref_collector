    "title": "Wage inequality within and across firms: The role of market forces, government and firm policies",
    "descriptions": [
        "Wage inequality has surged in industrialized nations over recent decades, with significant disparities emerging between firms rather than within them. Gender inequality remains pervasive, particularly exacerbated by the onset of parenthood. This proposal centers on firms to explore three critical questions: What market forces drive the increasing wage gap between firms? How do government policies influence wage structures? And how do firm policies and environments affect gender inequality? Leveraging four decades of comprehensive German social security records, supplemented with firm-level survey and administrative data, we will investigate these issues in depth. In Project A, we will examine how increased product market competition and technological changes that favor routine tasks have influenced the wage disparity between firms through market selection, employment reallocation, and differential wage growth. Project B will assess the impact of government policies, such as the introduction of a minimum wage and adjustments in business tax rates, on wage dispersion between firms, exploring selection, reallocation, and differential growth effects. Project C will analyze the effectiveness of firm-provided family-friendly policies, like flexible working hours and childcare, in mitigating gender inequality. Additionally, we will explore how the firm environment, characterized by the presence of coworkers with working mothers and egalitarian gender attitudes, influences mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories post-childbirth. Through these projects, we aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers and firms to address wage and gender inequality."

Furthermore, substantial inequality between men and women persists in all industrialised countries, and a large part of the gender gaps observed today is attributable to the arrival of children. In this proposal, we put firms at the centre of the analysis and ask the following questions: First, which market forces can (partly) explain the increasing wage inequality between firms? Second, how do government policies alter the wage structure? And third, how do firm policies and the firm environment impact on gender inequality? All projects draw on four decades of German social security records comprising the near universe of workers and establishments, which we augment with survey and administrative data on firms. In Project A, we investigate how two important market forces, increased product market competition and routine-biased technological change, contributed to the increasing wage inequality between firms, by changing which firms operate in the market (selection) and how employment is distributed across low and high productivity firms (reallocation), and by differentially affecting wage growth across firm types (differential wage growth). In Project B, we study how two prominent government policies, the introduction of a minimum wage and changes in business tax rates, affect wage dispersion between firms through selection, reallocation and differential growth effects. In Project C, we first analyse whether firm provided family-friendly policies, most notably flexible working times and child care facilities, can be effective at reducing gender inequality. We then investigate how the firm environment, specifically the presence of co-workers who are likely to have a working mother and hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, shapes mothersâ€™ return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.",
