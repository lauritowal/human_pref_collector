        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe METABODY project aims to explore the dynamic nature of body image in the modern socio-economic landscape, where technological and cultural advancements offer unprecedented means to modify and present one's physical appearance. By introducing the concept of Body Imagining, METABODY posits that body image is not a static representation but a dynamic inference shaped by a balance between prior expectations and new sensory information. This novel approach addresses a critical gap in current research, which has largely overlooked the metacognitive aspects of body image. METABODY hypothesizes that disturbances in body image are not solely due to perceptual biases but also involve higher-order cognitive processes that evaluate the reliability of these perceptions. To test this hypothesis, the project will conduct three empirical work-packages: (1) Body Metacognition, examining how individuals integrate their embodied experiences with external perspectives during multisensory perception; (2) Body Mentalizing, exploring the impact of social interactions on body image; and (3) Body Decision Making, investigating how people make choices about body modification under conditions of uncertainty. Through these interdisciplinary studies, METABODY seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between bodily invariance and personal identity in an era where body modification is increasingly accessible."

These proliferating phenomena raise the age-old question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity. Addressing this question in relation to modern body image phenomena requires a radical new way of studying the concept of body image. METABODY proposes the novel concept of Body Imagining to capture the idea that our body image is not a fixed representation in the brain, but rather a dynamic inference based on prior expectations and new information. Studying the balance between prior beliefs and new information could thus hold the key to understanding modern body image phenomena. Moreover, existing studies have failed to investigate the metacognitive level of these inferences. METABODY will test the novel hypothesis that body image disturbances are not the result of biases merely in the 1st order ability to perceive oneâ€™s body, but also in the 2nd order ability to evaluate the reliability of these perceptions in given contexts. Specifically, three empirical work-packages will study how individuals balance their own embodied experience against: (1) external perspectives on the body during multisensory perception (Body Metacognition), (2) social perspectives during interpersonal encounters (Body Mentalizing) and (3) future and ideal body perspectives during decisions about body modification options with uncertain outcome (Body Decision Making). Ultimately, METABODY will address in innovative ways the timely question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity in a time when changing the body is offered as an easy way to change the self.",
