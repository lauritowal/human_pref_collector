        "Interpersonal interactions play a crucial role in mental health, yet the mechanisms through which these interactions influence psychological well-being remain underexplored. The SynSig project hypothesizes that interpersonal synchrony, the coordinated behavior between individuals, is a key factor in therapeutic relationships, and that this synchrony is not uniform but rather individual-specific. Unlike traditional approaches that assume higher synchrony universally benefits mental health, SynSig proposes that each person has a unique synchrony signature that manifests across various social interactions. To enhance therapeutic outcomes, SynSig aims to identify and tailor interventions based on these individual signatures.\n\nThe project will focus on the therapeutic relationship between clients and therapists, using advanced multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expressions) to capture and analyze synchrony patterns. By examining these patterns in both real and virtual human interactions, SynSig seeks to disentangle trait-like synchrony signatures from state-like deviations. The ultimate goal is to develop a real-time feedback system that can guide individual-tailored adjustments in synchrony, thereby optimizing the therapeutic process. This innovative approach will not only deepen our understanding of the complex, multi-layered nature of interpersonal synchrony but also provide actionable insights for improving mental health outcomes."

But how such interactions affect mental health is poorly understood. SynSig suggests that interpersonal synchrony is an individual-specific mechanism underlying curative relationships. It seeks to go beyond the one-size-fits-all “the higher the synchrony the better” theoretical assumption underlying the state of the art research. It is the first to propose that individuals have their own individual-specific trait-like synchrony signature as manifests across interacting partners. It further proposes that to make interactions curative, it is necessary to induce an individual-tailored correction to such a signature. That is, the amount and direction of the changes in synchrony must be guided by the individual’s synchrony signature. To develop an individual-specific understanding of synchrony, SynSig focuses on curative interactions encapsulated in time and space: the therapeutic relationship between the client and therapist. It will investigate the existence of individual-specific synchrony signature and how individual-tailored correction of the signature serves as the mechanism transforming relationships into curative ones. It will implement multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) for disentangling the trait-like synchrony signature and state-like deviations from it, of individuals participating in multiple dyadic interactions with humans and virtual humans. The first multimodal feedback system on momentary deviations from the signature will be developed and used to facilitate individual-tailored changes in synchrony and draw causal inferences between such changes and mental health outcomes. The findings will provide new insights into the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and bring us closer to understanding how human connections affect our mental health.",
