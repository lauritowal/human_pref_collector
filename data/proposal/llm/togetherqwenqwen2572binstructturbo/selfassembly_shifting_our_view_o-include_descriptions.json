        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe AssemblingLife project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by challenging the conventional view that living organisms are systems characterized by the constant input of energy and precise genetic regulation. Instead, this project posits that life can be more accurately understood through the lens of self-assembly—a process where complex structures and patterns emerge spontaneously without external direction. By integrating insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, and material science, AssemblingLife will develop a novel theoretical framework within the philosophy of science to explain living processes. This framework will reinterpret the role of genes as \"nudgers\" that influence self-assembly rather than as detailed controllers. The project will also explore the implications of self-assembly for scientific explanation, proposing new theories that account for the non-mechanistic and non-interventional nature of these processes. AssemblingLife aims to contribute innovative theoretical and conceptual tools that will enhance both philosophical and empirical approaches to the life sciences, fostering a deeper and more nuanced understanding of life itself."

Living beings are mainly viewed as systems requiring the constant input of energy and the detailed regulation by genetic material. These ideas of life very much influence the general understanding of living systems, and, particularly interesting for this project, it influences current philosophy of science accounts of the understanding and explanation of living processes. But what if life is much less “hard work” than often presented? And what if genes should be understood as “nudgers” rather than as “directing” living processes? Self-assembly is the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structure. It can be visualized as a pile of lego bricks turning into a Ninjago fortress on its own. There are no lego-builders. The parts “self-assemble”, possibly as a result of chemical and physical processes working between and on the parts. Recent nanoscience research efforts at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and material science, increasingly utilize self-assembly processes in the development of new materials, technologies and understanding of living systems. AssemblingLife will, on an interdisciplinary basis, build a new theoretical framework withing the philosophy of science for understanding and explaining life, building on the increasing focus and knowledge about self-assembly processes that carry the potential to shift our view of life. The project will provide a new understanding of genetic causation starting from the idea of genes as “nudging” self-assembly processes rather than as providing detailed regulation, and it will develop new theory of scientific explanation that will account for the observation that self-assembly processes do not behave like classical mechanisms or interventions targets. AssemblingLife plan for contributing novel and needed theory and conceptual tools both to the philosophy of science and to the empirical life sciences.",
