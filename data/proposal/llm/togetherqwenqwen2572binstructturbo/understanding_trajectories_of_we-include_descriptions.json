        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe WEALTHTRAJECT project aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the diversity in long-term wealth accumulation trajectories within and between social groups, addressing the growing issue of wealth inequality in affluent societies. Moving beyond static analyses, this project adopts a dynamic perspective to explore the variability in wealth trajectories over individualsâ€™ lifetimes. By integrating various strands of literature, WEALTHTRAJECT examines how factors such as income management, family transfers, and investment choices contribute to the diversity in wealth accumulation. The project has four primary objectives: (i) to document the variability in wealth trajectories; (ii) to identify the intragenerational factors driving this variability; (iii) to establish the intergenerational links between family background and wealth trajectories; and (iv) to gather novel life history data on wealth accumulation. To achieve these goals, WEALTHTRAJECT employs a novel approach that emphasizes the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses, challenging the conventional hump-shaped life cycle model of wealth accumulation. By combining longitudinal data from surveys and registers with original life history data, and applying advanced quantitative methods, WEALTHTRAJECT will reveal new insights into the mechanisms underlying wealth inequality. The findings will inform social policies aimed at addressing wealth disparities and promoting more equitable wealth distribution."

Wealth inequality is on the rise in many affluent societies. It is time to move beyond prevailing static snapshots of average wealth inequality between people to understand this trend. Instead, a dynamic perspective on wealth changes experienced by people over their lifetimes is needed. This dynamic perspective reveals how diverse the trajectories of wealth accumulation are, i.e., the degree of trajectory variability. WEALTHTRAJECT integrates disconnected strands of literature to study how variability in trajectories emerges over time through the interplay of saving and spending of income, receipt of transfers from parents and other family members, and (de-)investment in (un-)profitable assets. WEALTHTRAJECT addresses four main innovative objectives: (i) to document variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives; (ii) to identify intragenerational drivers of variability in wealth trajectories; (iii) to establish the intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories; (iv) to collect novel life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories. To address these objectives, WEALTHTRAJECT innovates by adopting a novel approach emphasising the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses in people's lives. The project challenges the prevalent idea of a uniform hump-shaped life cycle accumulation pattern in wealth. WEALTHTRAJECT breaks new ground by combining longitudinal data from surveys and registers and original life history data on wealth that, for the first time, allow the mapping of wealth trajectories over extended periods of people's lives. Advanced quantitative methods are applied to leverage the untapped potential of these data. WEALTHTRAJECT lays the foundations for a new understanding of wealth inequality to inform relevant social policies.",
