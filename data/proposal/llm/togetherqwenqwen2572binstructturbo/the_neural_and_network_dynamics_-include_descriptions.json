        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal aims to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of peer influence on adolescent behavior, particularly in the context of social media and real-world peer networks. Despite the established importance of peer influence in adolescent development, the underlying processes and why adolescents are particularly susceptible remain underexplored. We propose to develop a novel theoretical framework that conceptualizes adolescents as active agents in the search for social information, rather than passive recipients. This framework will be operationalized through computational models and tested using a combination of behavioral tasks and neuroimaging techniques. Specifically, we will investigate when and how much adolescents seek social information, and from whom they choose to learn. Additionally, we will examine how brain development and pubertal hormones influence these social learning processes. To further validate our findings, we will conduct experimental studies within real peer social networks, using social network analysis to understand the diffusion of information and the impact of different peer types. Our research will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of social learning and can inform the development of interventions to mitigate risk behaviors and enhance prosocial and educational outcomes in adolescents."

More recently, peer influence seems to be amplified by developments in social media (e.g. viral risk-taking challenges). However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms underlying peer influence, or why adolescents are specifically sensitivity. The primary goal of this proposal is to gain insights in the role of social information in adolescent behavior, by developing a new theoretical framework that will be formalized in novel computational models. First, in contrast with previous accounts, adolescents are not treated as the passive receivers of social information, but considered as agents that play an active role in searching for social information. This search revolves around two main questions: when to search for social information, and who to learn from. To track development in social learning strategies I will develop novel tasks to investigate (1) when, and how much, social information is searched for, and (2) who adolescents will go to. Second, I will employ computational models in combination with functional magnetic imaging to gain insight in how brain development, and pubertal hormones are associated with changes in specific computational processes that are involved in social learning. Thirdly, social learning will for the first time be studied experimentally in real peer social networks. Social network analyses will be used to elucidate the impact of different types of peers, and to study the diffusion of information through peer groups. Our findings will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of social learning in the context of real world social networks. Such fundamental knowledge can inform the development of interventions preventing risk or promoting prosocial behavior and educational outcomes.",
