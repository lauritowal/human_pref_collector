    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"TransOcean\" aims to investigate the increasing maritime trespass by Chinese and Vietnamese fishing fleets in Africa and Oceania, moving beyond the South China Sea. While existing research often views fishers as mere instruments of state geopolitics, TransOcean seeks to uncover the true motivations and methods behind their expansion. By examining the complex transoceanic networks that connect fishers across regions, the project will explore how these individuals navigate legal and illegal statuses, and how their activities intersect with those of local Pacific and African fishers. Utilizing the innovative concept of relational and shifting multiple mobilities, TransOcean will develop a new theoretical and methodological framework to understand fishers as dynamic maritime actors. Through fine-grained ethnographic research, the project will focus on Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers at key on-shore locations, linked by the growing demand for illicit seafood. This multi-scalar, globally oriented study aims to provide novel insights and solutions to pressing marine issues, offering significant value for both scientific research and policy-making."

Scholarly analysis has largely assumed that fishers are instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations and incentives. This both obscures the actual motivations and modalities of fishers’ expansion of their fishing grounds and downplays the transoceanic networks connecting different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting this spike in maritime trespass, TransOcean will analyze and theorize how individuals and groups of fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader and smuggler, and how the emergent mobilities of Asian fishers interact and collide with those of Pacific and African fishers. Deploying the innovative concept of relational and shifting multiple mobilities and employing thalassographic analysis, TransOcean develops a novel theoretical and methodological framework of fishers as mobile maritime actors who exploit their multiple occupations, incomes and networks to pursue transoceanic expansion. TransOcean studies, for the first time, diverse groups of interconnected fishers outside of territorially bounded fisheries and area studies, by analyzing mobilities beyond sea-borne migration or diasporic settlement. Though multi-scalar and globally oriented TransOcean remains firmly rooted in fine-grained ethnography, with a focus on Vietnamese and Chinese and African and Pacific fishers in specific on-shore nodal points, connected by the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. Thus, TransOcean breaks new methodological and theoretical ground for tackling intractable marine problems of significant scientific and policy value.",
