        "In the context of global economic and environmental challenges, foraging has emerged as a critical yet underexplored economic practice. This project seeks to develop a comprehensive political ecology of foraging in the Anthropocene, focusing on its role as a socio-economic strategy and its implications for environmental conservation. From the collection of yartsagunbu in Tibet and Nepal to the extraction of minerals in Amazonia and Mongolia, foraging represents a diverse and global phenomenon that has gained significant relevance, especially in the aftermath of the 2008-2011 financial crisis. As traditional employment models wane and environmental pressures intensify, foraging offers a viable pathway to social mobility and resource acquisition. However, this practice also intersects with pressing conservation concerns, creating a complex landscape of socio-environmental interactions that require deeper investigation. This interdisciplinary project, led by an international team of five researchers at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, aims to fill this gap by providing a nuanced understanding of foraging's multifaceted impacts. The project will produce two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a documentary film, and a public exhibition, contributing to both academic discourse and broader societal awareness. Through this comprehensive approach, the project will shed light on the evolving dynamics of foraging and its role in shaping sustainable futures."

In Tibet and Nepal, scores of collectors rush to the mountains each spring to collect yartsagunbu – a rare mushroom more valuable than gold. In Siberia, “tuskers” scavenge for woolly mammoth ivory in the thawing permafrost. From Amazonia to Mongolia, artisanal miners extract precious minerals where transnational conglomerates have left. In the US, “Amazon nomads” tour foreclosed shops and sell their bounty online. Broadly understood as practices of collecting, scavenging and gleaning, foraging is a global phenomenon of our times. However, it only gains patchy attention in mainstream debates on conservation and development. What is missing is a conceptual understanding of foraging as a basic economic strategy and a form of socio-environmental entanglement. The objective of this project is to take on this task and develop a political ecology of foraging in the Anthropocene. The project is timely. In the aftermath of the world financial crisis between 2008 to 2011, foraging has gained in relevance around the globe. In an era when the dream of a middle-class life based on a stable, salaried job no longer seems viable, and in places where the welfare state is under pressure, has never existed or has vanished, foraging is often the only avenue to upward social mobility. At the same time, the climate crisis and concerns for the rapid loss of biodiversity are raising the urgency for environmental conservation. To understand the evolving frictions at this interface is highly relevant at this historical moment – both in academia and beyond. Interdisciplinary in outlook but grounded in anthropology, the project will be carried out by an international team of five researchers at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich. Outputs include 2 monograph, 3 edited collections, 3 PhD thesis, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film and an exhibition.",
