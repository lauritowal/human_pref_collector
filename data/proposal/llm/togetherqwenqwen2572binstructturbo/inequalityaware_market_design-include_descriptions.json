        "This project aims to advance the field of market design by integrating considerations of inequality into the design of market mechanisms. Traditional economic theories advocate for market efficiency, often overlooking the disparities among market participants. By developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), this research seeks to identify optimal market structures that balance efficiency with equity, particularly in contexts where significant inequalities exist. Utilizing a mechanism-design framework, the study will examine scenarios where market designers can adjust the allocation of goods or services based on observed inequalities, potentially sacrificing some allocative efficiency to achieve a fairer distribution of surplus. The research will explore the conditions under which such interventions are justified, focusing on the role of private information and the designer's redistributive preferences. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical testing, the project will provide policymakers with a robust framework for designing markets that not only function efficiently but also contribute to reducing social and economic inequalities. This work is crucial in addressing the growing concern of inequality within market design and complements existing approaches to redistribution through taxation and other fiscal measures."

Yet, traditional economic intuition opposes these sorts of policies because—unlike well-functioning markets—they introduce allocative inefficiency. In this project, I will explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). My approach is to deploy a mechanism-design framework that identifies the optimal way to structure the market. In the baseline framework, the designer maximizes a welfare function whose welfare weights reflect her redistributive preferences induced by the inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information both about their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. Research will focus on testing the validity and scope of the main hypothesis: When inequalities are sufficiently pronounced and can be detected based on agents’ behavior in the market, it becomes optimal to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable split of surplus. For example, optimal market designs may involve inefficient rationing. Inequality-aware Market Design provides a novel way to address the growing problem of inequality in market-design settings. The redistributive objective distinguishes this theory from the traditional mechanism-design literature that has focused predominantly on efficiency and revenue as design goals; the focus on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace complements the public-finance approach to redistribution through the tax system. IMD provides policy guidance by explaining whether and how policymakers concerned about inequality should resort to distortionary market interventions.",
