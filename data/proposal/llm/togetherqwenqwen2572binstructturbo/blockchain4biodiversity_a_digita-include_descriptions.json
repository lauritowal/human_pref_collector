    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to address the critical issue of conserving agrobiodiversity, particularly through the in situ cultivation of indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK). Despite the importance of ISK for global food security and sustainable agriculture, farmers lack economic incentives to maintain these resources due to the absence of intellectual property protections and the lack of mechanisms to track the end use of ISK. To tackle these challenges, we propose the development and testing of a novel digital farmers’ market, ReSeed, which leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparent and traceable transactions. ReSeed will facilitate equitable exchanges of ISK, incentivize honest reporting of downstream research and innovation, and provide a platform for recognizing the contributions of small farmers. Using a mixed methods approach, we will engage with ISK suppliers and buyers to co-design the technical specifications and incentive structures of ReSeed. Additionally, we will explore the integration of ReSeed into existing international regulatory frameworks, developing a governance model and ethical guidelines to support its adoption. This project builds on 12 years of research into sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds, aiming to enhance in situ conservation, promote research and innovation, and generate economic and environmental benefits for small farmers."

While indigenous seeds can be preserved in seed banks, problems of viability over prolonged storage and rapid climate change necessitate on-farm (in situ) conservation. However, farmers face dwindling economic incentives to cultivate and thereby conserve ISK in situ: ISK is ineligible for protection under intellectual property laws and there are currently no systems in place for tracking the end use to which ISK are put (e.g. end-user consumption or downstream research). The fundamental problem here is in tracing who the first farmer (group) was that put an ISK on the “market”, who accessed it, and what was done with it. Using features of blockchain technology that can help track the flow of ISK in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way, my goal is to develop and test a technical specification for a first-of-its-kind digital farmers’ market (ReSeed) that (i) facilitates equitable and traceable transfers of farmers’ ISK, and (ii) incentivizes honest reporting-back of downstream research and innovation therewith. Using a mixed methods research approach, I will conduct original empirical research with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that will inform ReSeed’s design. I will also demonstrate how ReSeed can be integrated into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments, and create a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers’ communities. ReSeed will build on my 12-year research on means of incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds. It will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers’ ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.",
