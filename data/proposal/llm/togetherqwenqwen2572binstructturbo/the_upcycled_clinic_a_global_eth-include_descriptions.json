    "title": "The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine",
    "descriptions": [
        "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare sector, particularly hospitals, has emerged as a significant source of waste. While technological solutions promoting circular economies have received attention, the Upcycled Clinic project takes a unique ethnographic approach to explore creative practices of repurposing existing materials within clinical settings. This project comprises five sub-projects, each examining innovative practices in diverse global contexts, from Antarctica to Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K. A team of ethnographers will conduct fieldwork and interviews with a wide range of healthcare workers, including often-overlooked staff such as cleaners and laundry personnel. By analyzing open datasets of pandemic-driven improvisations, the project aims to identify the conditions that foster or hinder creative material engagement in healthcare settings. This study will advance the social study of medicine in three key areas: it will broaden the focus of hospital ethnographies beyond patient encounters to include material practices; it will provide the first global study of clinical improvisation; and it will innovate methodologically by developing new ways to reuse and share research materials, integrating sensory methods and addressing data waste. These contributions will enhance theoretical understandings of materiality and resilience, while providing practical insights into how healthcare can better leverage local creativity to address wastefulness and shortages."

Hospitals in particular have become nodes of disposability. Solutions to this problem has to date attracted mostly the attention of medical technology companies promoting circular economies, a model still reliant on production and technological innovation. The Upcycled Clinic takes a different direction. This ethnographic project focuses on creative practices such as repurposing in the clinic, involving making the most of existing materials. Five sub-projects have been carefully selected with illuminating examples around the world including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S and U.K. A team of ethnographers will conduct fieldwork and interviews with a range of actors, many often overlooked, such as cleaners and laundry staff, and look at open datasets of pandemic improvisations. The overarching objective is, through comparison, to better understand conditions which cultivate and curtail creative material engagement in the clinic. This inventive and timely contribution to the social study of medicine will advance the field in at least three directions. First, by attending more closely to materials, it moves hospital ethnographies beyond current focus on the patient encounter. Second, it will offer the first globally orientated study of improvisation in the clinic. Third, it breaks new methodological ground in the social sciences by developing novel ways of reusing and sharing research material in ethnography that adopts sensory methods and rethinks data waste. These contributions from the rich case of the clinic will add empirical insights to theories of materiality and help address long standing questions regarding resilience and innovation in the workplace. Practically, the study will articulate conditions under which healthcare can leverage creativity and pay better attention to local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.",
