        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the underlying mechanisms driving changes in government structures, a phenomenon that has persisted since the emergence of the modern state. Traditional explanations often attribute these changes to the influence of political parties, yet structural shifts have occurred even in the absence of party systems, and the contemporary decline of party dominance suggests the involvement of other, underexplored factors. The project, titled STATE-DNA, seeks to fill this gap by examining the internal units of ministries and agencies as the fundamental components of government. It proposes a novel theory of evolutionary government, viewing structural changes as an interaction between a unit’s characteristics and its organizational and environmental contexts. This multi-level approach will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the forces shaping government structures, moving beyond party-centric explanations. STATE-DNA will compile and analyze a vast dataset covering approximately 150,000 units across six countries from 1815 to 2025, using advanced biological methods such as data assimilation techniques. By integrating historical legislative data and environmental features, this project will not only identify the origins and consequences of structural changes but also develop predictive models to forecast future transformations in government. This innovative approach will provide a deeper insight into how government structures influence policy, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of governance and its evolution."

Traditionally, the answer refers to political parties exercising control over a state bureaucracy. Yet government structures have been changing ever since they emerged alongside the modern state and thus already before parties existed. The recent decline of party government worldwide also begs the question whether other actors and mechanisms matter that have been underestimated so far. Meanwhile, it became a truism that “structure shapes policy”, but existing research focuses on other effects of structural change in government, such as democratic and economic outcomes or cabinet governance. We lack systematic analyses of how structural change affects government policy. To address these gaps, STATE-DNA studies the change of units inside ministries and agencies as the ‘building blocks’ of the modern state. It submits a novel theory of evolutionary government that regards structural change in government as an interplay between a unit’s structural features and its organizational and environmental environment. This notion of multiple levels allows to study more than ‘party-centric’ causes of change and, for the first time, to analyze the effects on government policy explicitly, as evolutionary consequences managed by distinct units. STATE-DNA breaks new ground by applying genetic measures to assess structural change in government, establishing the most comprehensive data set, which begins with the ‘primordial soup’ of the early 19th century when government structures fragmented (~150,000 units, six countries, 1815–2025). For the empirical analyses, existing (historical) data on legislative activity, organizational, and environmental features will be used and extended. STATE-DNA will exploit methodological advancements in biology, such as data assimilation techniques, to analyze the origins and consequences of structural change in government and to forecast such change, thereby injecting a predictive notion into government studies.",
