        "This project aims to deepen our understanding of inequality and its macroeconomic impacts by examining it through three dimensions: Consumption, Income, and Wealth, collectively termed \"3D Inequality.\" Utilizing innovative microdata, we will meticulously measure economic activities at the household level, providing a comprehensive view of the economy. Recent advancements in heterogeneous agent models have shown that distributional factors can significantly influence macroeconomic outcomes and the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies. These models also enable the exploration of how different policies impact various household groups. However, the lack of precise micro-level data has hindered the identification of the most critical mechanisms linking inequality and the macroeconomy. Our research will bridge this gap by aligning empirical efforts with the latest theoretical models, focusing on the micro heterogeneity that is most relevant to macroeconomic theory. This approach will enhance the accuracy and relevance of current and future macroeconomic models. The insights gained from this project have the potential to significantly improve policy tools, offering valuable guidance to policymakers in addressing the growing concern of economic inequality. By providing a clearer picture of the forces driving inequality, our findings will contribute to more informed and effective policy decisions."

We will study inequality and its dynamics along three dimensions: Consumption, Income and Wealth, “3D Inequality.” With novel microdata we can measure the entirety of the economy down to the single household along the 3 dimensions. In macroeconomics, much theoretical progress has been made in understanding when distributions matter for aggregates. Newer heterogeneous agent models deliver strikingly different implications for monetary and fiscal policies than what the traditional representative agent models do, and also allow us to study the distributional implications of different policies across households. In principle, this class of models can incorporate the potentially rich interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy: on the one hand, inequality shapes macroeconomic aggregates; on the other hand, macroeconomic shocks and policies affect inequality. However, absent precise micro-level facts it is difficult to establish which of the potential mechanisms highlighted by these models are the most important in reality. Our empirical efforts will be disciplined by these recent developments in modelling macroeconomic phenomena with microeconomic heterogeneity. Our overarching motivation is to quantify the type of micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory and thereby inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models. The novel insights we aim to provide could lead to substantial improvements in both fiscal and monetary policy tools. Furthermore, a better understanding of the forces behind growing inequality will inform the current debate on this issue and provide important lessons to policy makers who see economic inequality as a problem in itself.",
