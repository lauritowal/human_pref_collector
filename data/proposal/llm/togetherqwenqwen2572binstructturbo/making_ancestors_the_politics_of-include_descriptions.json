        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the dynamics of politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe, challenging the traditional dichotomy that has often characterized the Neolithic as egalitarian and the Bronze and Iron Ages as stratified. We propose a novel, interdisciplinary approach to test alternative models of inequality and deathways, focusing on Peninsular Italy, a region representative of broader European trends. The project will analyze over 200 individuals from three key periods: the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), the Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and the Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC). By employing osteobiography, we will reconstruct the life stories of these individuals using scientific data on identity, health, diet, mobility, and kinship. Additionally, we will apply funerary taphonomy to understand the treatment of the dead and their political roles. This combination of methodologies will provide a comprehensive view of how inequality manifested in prehistoric societies, not just through overt political structures, but through differential life chances, kinship, ritual, and ancestorhood. The results will offer a nuanced understanding of the social relations and political dynamics that shaped prehistoric Europe, contributing to a more accurate and holistic history of inequality and its impact on ancient lives."

Traditionally, politics has been seen in terms of discrete political ranks identified through differential treatment of individual burials. But this results in classifying much of prehistory, where the dead were treated in ways which effaced individual identity, as egalitarian. The result is an artificially dichotomous history: Neolithic people had landscapes, rituals and ancestors, Bronze and Iron Age people had politics and inequality. In the last two decades this approach has been strongly critiqued. Burial treatment rarely relates to status so directly; the dead serve many different political roles. Inequality in pre-state groups rarely consists of clear strata; inequality and equality exist in tension within groups. Inequality may have been present throughout European prehistory, but manifest situationally through differential life chances, kinship, ritual or ancestorhood, rather than overtly through political command, wealth or identity. But this new perspective has never been tested empirically. This project tests alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways. To investigate social relations in life, it uses osteobiography, reconstructing life stories from skeletons through scientific data on identity, health, diet, mobility and kinship. To understand deathways, it employs a second new methodology, funerary taphonomy. Combining osteobiography and taphonomy allows us to connect ancient lives and deaths. Peninsular Italy provides a substantial test sequence typical of much of Europe. For each of three key periods (Neolithic, 6000-4000 BC; Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, 4000-1800 BC; Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age, 1800-600 BC), 200+ individuals will be analysed. The results will allow us to evaluate for the first time how inequality affected lives in prehistoric Europe and what role ancestors played in it.",
