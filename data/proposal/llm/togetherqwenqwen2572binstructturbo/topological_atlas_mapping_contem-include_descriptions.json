        "In the contemporary landscape, borders have evolved into multifaceted entities, simultaneously porous and impenetrable, challenging traditional notions of sovereignty and mobility. This proposal outlines a transdisciplinary research initiative aimed at redefining the understanding and representation of border zones through the development of a digital atlas. The project, termed \"Topological Atlas,\" employs a novel methodology that integrates digital technologies with participatory approaches, focusing on the experiences of marginalized individuals at border sites. By utilizing topology as both a conceptual and methodological framework, the project seeks to create visual counter-geographies that facilitate seamless transitions between the spaces inhabited by migrants and those controlled by security apparatuses. This approach disrupts conventional cartographic norms, particularly those reinforced by mainstream GIS and mapping platforms. The research aims to innovate in the field of visual and co-produced research, adapting methodologies to crisis situations and moving beyond traditional top-down perspectives in international relations and security studies. The central research question guiding this project is: How can mapping be utilized to depict borders as topological entities through the experiences of those who encounter them? Through this inquiry, the project seeks to contribute to a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of border dynamics, acknowledging the interplay between academic research, the knowledge it generates, and its practical implications."

They have been variously conceptualised as porous, shifting and solidified. Where a border may be open for some, for others it is an impenetrable wall. Combined with the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations that operate beyond legal frameworks, such as the formation of ISIS and the situation in Europe where borders are being opened and closed against agreed treaties, the very concept of the border is being radically questioned. We need new ways to make sense of these increasingly complex spaces. This proposal aims to develop a transdisciplinary research programme for mapping, analysing and intervening in border areas in the form of a digital atlas. Topological Atlas is developed as a methodology for producing visual counter-geographies at border sites. It is ground breaking in its use of digital technologies combined with a participative approach that attends to those who are at the margins of traditional geopolitical inquiry. The project uses topology as conceptual framework and methodology to make maps that produce ‘seamless transitions’ from the space of the migrant to that of the security apparatus that creates barriers to her movement. In doing so it seeks to disrupt the cartographic norms that are being reinforced through the prevalence of GIS technology and mapping platforms such as Google Earth. It investigates forms of visual and co-produced research adapted to situations of crisis and proposes a new model for researching border areas beyond the current top-down international relations or security perspective. At the same time it acknowledges the intertwined relationship between the practice of academic inquiry, the knowledge it produces and what such knowledge can do. The project is organised around the following research question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?",
