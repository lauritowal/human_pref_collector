        "In an era where social engagement is a cornerstone of web-based platforms, the underlying dynamics and implications of user interactions remain underexplored. Despite the widespread adoption of social computing features designed to foster user engagement, there is a significant gap in understanding the economic and societal impacts of these practices. This proposal outlines a research agenda aimed at elucidating the effects of user engagement, particularly when it is prompted through calls to action. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including innovative laboratory experiments and large-scale field studies, the project seeks to provide a nuanced view of how proactive engagement mechanisms influence user behavior, conversion rates, and information sharing. By collaborating with a leading website-development service provider, the research will leverage real-world data to examine the efficacy and consequences of these engagement strategies across various domains. Preliminary findings indicate that calls to action can significantly enhance user participation and data disclosure. This project aims to build on these insights, offering a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms driving these outcomes and their broader implications for businesses and society. The anticipated results will not only inform strategic decisions for web-based platforms but also contribute to a more informed public discourse on the role of social computing in digital environments."

Accordingly, websites in numerous domains invest heavily in ‘social computing’ features that encourage such engagement. In fact, many attempt to elicit engagement proactively, through the use of calls to action—prompts that ask users to carry out participatory actions such as rating or ‘liking’ content. Given the vast popularity of social computing, it is surprising how little we actually know about how user engagement affects websites and their users. From a business perspective, the direct value of user engagement is far from clear. From a societal perspective, it is unclear whether the increasing expectation for users to engage with firms may lead users to behave in ways that do not serve them. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of user engagement, and specifically, engagement elicited by calls to action, from those two perspectives. I will use an empirical approach, relying on innovative lab and large-scale field experiments. The lab experiments leverage a specially-designed website. For the field experiments, we will collaborate with websites spanning several domains; we have already initiated a relationship with a leading website-development service provider that uses a freemium business model, and have been able to observe the actual behavior of its users. Our preliminary results are promising, supporting the idea that calls to action have strong effects on conversion and information revelation. Moving forward, I plan to fully characterize the nature of these effects in multiple product domains, and to isolate their underlying mechanisms. I am confident that this research program will transform our understanding of the economic and broader societal impact of the social computing phenomenon.",
