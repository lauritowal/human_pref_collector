        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance the field of Global Citizenship Education (GCE) by addressing a critical gap in current research: the lack of systematic baseline data on how students from diverse backgrounds understand and appropriate GCE. Despite the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals emphasizing GCE’s potential to foster more peaceful and inclusive societies, particularly in contexts with significant indigenous and migrant populations, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on student engagement and perceptions. The STUDACT project hypothesizes that students are active agents in their learning, with varying levels of engagement influenced by personal traits and contextual factors. To explore this, STUDACT will conduct a comprehensive, multi-country study in Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK, all of which have substantial migrant populations. The project will employ four interconnected work packages: group discussions, photovoice activism, social media analysis, and policy and curriculum analysis. These methods will provide a nuanced understanding of how students from different backgrounds interpret and engage with GCE, revealing both intra- and inter-country variations. By answering key questions on student understanding, appropriation, and alignment with international and local educational frameworks, STUDACT will lay a robust foundation for the effective implementation of GCE, ensuring it meets its transformative potential by 2030."

It is claimed to have the potential to transform education systems, empowering learners to build more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies, while fostering mutual understanding, especially in interactions between indigenous and migrant populations. Many education systems now expect students to appropriate GCE in their day-to-day. Extant research has addressed challenges in developing GCE, examining capacity building (teachers’ readiness to teach GCE) or mapping inconsistencies in theoretical approaches. However, with no systematic baseline research to show how GCE is understood and appropriated by students, there is little hope of real progress by 2030. STUDACT starts afresh, hypothesising that students are not mere passive recipients of learning – they differ in their desire to engage with GCE, based on personal traits or context. It will explore and contextualise how students receive, understand and appropriate GCE, treating them as core partners and agentic participants. Data will be collected in Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK – all countries with a high migrant influx. Four work packages give students a voice to develop meaningful GCE, using group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. Policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance will be analysed. STUDACT will answer four questions to ensure a strong foundation for GCE to deliver on its promise of educating the next generation: (1) how do students of different backgrounds understand GCE? (2) how do students appropriate GCE? (3) how do understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems? (4) how are student attitudes aligned with those inferred by international organisations, teacher training programmes, curricula developers, or teachers?",
