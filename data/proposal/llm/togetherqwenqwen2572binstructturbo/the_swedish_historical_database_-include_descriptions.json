        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe Swedish Historical Data Base Project aims to compile and publicly disseminate highly detailed, annual data for approximately 2,500 Swedish administrative districts spanning from 1749 to 1952. This comprehensive dataset will encompass a wide array of information, including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agricultural statistics, and infrastructure investments, such as railway construction. The project's uniqueness lies in its extensive and continuous coverage at the local administrative level, leveraging Sweden's unparalleled historical records, which provide the world's longest and most reliable data series on population and vital statistics, dating back to 1749. This extensive dataset will generate over 0.5 million observations, enabling a deep and nuanced understanding of economic growth, structural transformation, and development over a 200-year period. The rich, disaggregated nature of the data will facilitate robust empirical analyses, including instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimations. As a preliminary example, the project has already demonstrated the potential of this data by exploring how democratization affects resource redistribution towards the poor, using a regression-discontinuity design based on population size. This research is currently under review at Econometrica. Upon completion, the dataset will be utilized to address a range of critical questions in economic development and growth, contributing significantly to both academic and policy discussions."

The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction). The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500×T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size. This paper is currently “revise and resubmit” 2nd round at Econometrica. After collecting the new data, we intend to studying a number of questions related to economic development and growth.",
