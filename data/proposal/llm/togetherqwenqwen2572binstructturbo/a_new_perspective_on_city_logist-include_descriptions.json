    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nGoodMobility seeks to transform city logistics (CL) by integrating the mobility of goods into the public value framework. Current CL paradigms, which focus primarily on technological and business efficiencies, fail to address the broader societal impacts of goods movement. This proposal aims to redefine CL through the development of a network-centric, wise logistics approach that prioritizes public value. The project has three main objectives: First, to create a comprehensive measurement system for public value, guiding CL planning and management through an iterative process that combines multi-criteria decision-making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. Second, to develop the principles, models, and tools necessary for designing the infrastructure of logistics as a service (LaaS), leveraging novel network optimization methods to achieve significant efficiency gains and align stakeholder activities with public value. Third, to establish a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, including the introduction of logistics markets to ensure efficiency, reliability, and the maximization of public value in matching logistics demand and supply. Advanced learning-based optimization methods will be employed to manage these logistics markets. If successful, GoodMobility will not only lay the foundation for a new theory of CL but also open up new research avenues with profound social, economic, and environmental implications."

Goods are gaining more mobility with drastic implications for cities. The current city logistics (CL) paradigm, which does not consider the mobility of goods a public need, limits our capacity to understand and respond to the challenges and opportunities brought by this profound change. Taking a different perspective, GoodMobility proposes to replace the techno-business-centric smart thinking with network-centric wise logistics that takes the public value as the primary goal and envisions setting up a logistics web with the required infrastructure (hardware) and operating procedures (software) to establish logistics as a service (LaaS). The first objective is to develop public value as a measurement system to assess and guide CL planning and management, which will be achieved with an iterative process, combining multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. The second objective is to develop the principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design. Novel network optimization methods will be developed for designing the hardware of LaaS to provide orders of magnitude efficiency gains and influence the stakeholder activities to maximize public value. The third objective is to develop a theoretical framework and models for the operating procedures of LaaS, introducing the logistics markets to ensure efficiency and reliability and secure public value in matching logistics demand and supply. Learning-based optimization methods will be developed to manage logistics markets. If successful, GoodMobility will lay the foundations of a new theory of CL with significant scientific and practical implications. The novel ideas, concepts, and methodologies will open up new research perspectives in transport and logistics with far-reaching social, economic, and environmental consequences.",
