        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe SHARES project aims to revolutionize the understanding and allocation of international responsibilities in scenarios where multiple actors collaborate to achieve common global goals, such as environmental protection and the prevention of mass atrocities. As international cooperation becomes increasingly complex, the traditional frameworks for assigning responsibility often fall short, leading to a dilution of accountability and a potential undermining of the international rule of law. This project will investigate the challenges posed by the scattering of responsibilities across various actors and propose innovative solutions to ensure that international cooperation enhances, rather than diminishes, the effectiveness of shared responsibilities.\n\nSHARES will explore two primary dimensions: principles and processes. In terms of principles, the project will examine the feasibility of attributing collective, joint, or proportional responsibility to multiple actors involved in international policies. Regarding processes #=> , it will reassess how (quasi-)judicial mechanisms can be adapted to account for the collective nature of state and non-state actor involvement in international affairs. By combining theoretical analysis with empirical case studies, SHARES will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how to align international cooperation with a robust system of shared responsibility. This research aims to fill a critical gap in the current legal and academic discourse, ultimately contributing to more effective and just international governance."

International cooperation may complicate attempts to determine who is responsible for what. SHARES is based on the unrecognized and unexplored fact that as the responsibility for policies is shared among more actors, the discrete responsibility of every individual actor is diminished proportionately. International cooperation paradoxically may undermine the key objectives of any scheme of responsibility : the protection of the international rule of law and the provision of remedies of injured parties. The dominant principle of individual responsibility, and the scholarship based on it, provides us neither with the concepts nor the perspectives for addressing shared responsibilities. SHARES will uncover the extent and nature of the problem of scattering of international responsibilities in cases of international cooperation and will provide fresh perspectives on how cooperation can be better matched by a corresponding system of international responsibility. It will pursue two interlocking tracks, focussing on principles and processes of international responsibility. As to principles, it will examine the possibility of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly or proportionately responsible. As to processes, SHARES will rethink how (quasi-)judicial processes may better taken into account the collective context of the international policies of states and other actors. SHARES will complement a conceptual and theoretical foundation with a thorough empirical approach, exploring through case-studies how we can improve our understanding of the principles and processes that are needed to match the unprecedented international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility.",
