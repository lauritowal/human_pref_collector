        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address the underexplored yet critical issue of State silence in international law. The project aims to investigate whether and under what circumstances the inaction of States can create legal obligations, influence State responsibility, and impact international dispute resolution. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of State silence, the project will develop a taxonomy of different forms of silence and their legal implications. It will also critically examine the role of State inaction in international courts and tribunals, particularly focusing on the consequences of non-appearance. The research will draw from a wide array of State practices, international jurisprudence, and scholarly literature in the six official languages of the United Nations. Empirical methods will be employed to analyze the reasoning of government officials and international judges, assessing the advantages and disadvantages of State silence in judicial procedures. The outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to the understanding of State obligations and the potential need for legal reform in this area."

It is identified by observing the behaviour of States and deriving rules from their behaviour. But, what happens when States do nothing? Can States be bound by their own silence? Can international law develop through the silence of States? Can States be responsible for doing nothing? What happens when States do not appear before international courts and tribunals? These questions are immensely significant for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, who are all interested in knowing what the obligations of States are and how they can be enforced within and outside international courts and tribunals. Yet, there are major gaps in our understanding of the meaning of State silence and its legal effects. This project is the first comprehensive study of the silence of States in international law. It will explore and analyze whether the silence of States can bind them, and if so, under which circumstances; the role of State inaction for the responsibility of States; and the effect of State inaction in the field of international dispute settlement, focusing particularly on the proceedings before international courts and tribunals. It aims (a) to make a major contribution to knowledge on the meaning of silence by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the ‘silences’ of States and on the legal effects of different ‘silences’; and (b) to critically analyse whether a change in the law may be called for. The project will conduct research in wide-ranging and geographically representative State practice available in the six official languages of the United Nations, international jurisprudence and literature. It will also employ empirical analysis of the reasoning of government officials’ and international judges in order to assess the advantages and disadvantages of States silence, in the form of non-appearance, in international judicial procedures.",
