    "descriptions": [
        "This research project, titled \"ReloCare,\" explores the under-examined phenomenon of care relocation, where elderly individuals from wealthier European countries move to Central Eastern Europe for more affordable care. This trend, often labeled with contentious terms like ‘grandmother deportation’ or ‘geriatric colonialism,’ reflects the broader marketization of care services and the cross-border dynamics of welfare entitlements. Through a multi-sited anthropological study, ReloCare will focus on care homes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary that cater to patients primarily from Austria and Germany. These institutions provide care at approximately one-third the cost of comparable facilities in the patients' home countries. The project will delve into the socio-economic and historical contexts of these regions, many of which have a significant German and Habsburg-Hungarian heritage, influencing the current care landscape. The study will examine the operations of these care homes, run by both former migrant care workers and international corporations, and their impact on local and transnational communities. Ethnographic research will uncover the daily realities of care, while also analyzing the roles of care entrepreneurs and state insurance systems in facilitating this movement. By integrating these various dimensions, ReloCare aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and the implications for aging and care in an interconnected Europe."

This project looks at the reverse phenomenon: care relocation, in which the ageing body is relocated to places where care is more affordable. This hotly contested trend, described as ‘grandmother deportation’ or ‘geriatric colonialism’, can be seen as an extreme example of the marketization of care, and entangling welfare states as entitlements are carried across national borders within Europe. This multi-sited anthropological study will take as case studies care homes in Central Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) that recruit patients from Austria and Germany, and offer care at roughly one-third of the cost of similar institutions in the home countries. What does care relocation do to the people and places involved? Most of these care homes are located in regions characterized by a long German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, adding historical complexity to the story. Some serve only German-speaking patients, others serve local, wealthier elderly people as well. They are run by former migrant care workers and by international companies, bringing labour migration and real estate investment into the picture. ReloCare breaks new ground by encompassing all of these aspects in one study. Alongside in-depth ethnographic studies of daily life in these care homes, the researchers will investigate the nexus of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and the histories of places and regional migration, providing an understanding of these new transnational entanglements of welfare states. In perceiving care relocation as both part of future making and a response to the privatization of care landscapes in the region, it asks what it means to become old and in need of care in an increasingly intertwined Europe.",
