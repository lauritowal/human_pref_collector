        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal aims to advance our understanding of the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes in human cognition. Traditional research has often focused on static stimuli and adult subjects, overlooking the dynamic and developmental aspects of these processes. Our project will address this gap by integrating behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to explore unconscious and conscious perception, as well as the maturation of consciousness in early development. Specifically, we will investigate unconscious perception using Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel method that allows the presentation of subliminal video sequences to study how the brain processes dynamic, unconsciously perceived information. For conscious perception, we will employ a Bayesian framework to examine how prior knowledge influences the construction of conscious percepts, particularly in situations of partial awareness. Additionally, we will explore the neural mechanisms underlying the development of consciousness in pre-verbal infants, using psychophysical measures and high-density EEG to determine whether conscious processes emerge from the maturation of posterior sensory regions or anterior prefrontal areas. The findings from this project are expected to reveal new insights into the complex forms of subliminal influences, the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and the developmental trajectory of consciousness in humans."

Most research on this topic has been limited to a static perspective, by studying static stimuli, by considering processing as a function of present information, and by focusing on a single, adult stage of development. Yet, both conscious and unconscious mental processes are intrinsically driven by dynamic properties. We will study these properties by relying on behavioral and brain imaging methods along three tracks: 1) Unconscious perception: Our visual system is, in real life, constantly receiving unconscious sequences of information that will generate dynamic and constantly updated processing streams. We will study these dynamic unconscious streams, thanks to Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel approach allowing for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. 2) Conscious perception: Construction of a conscious percept does not only depend on present stimulation but also on interactions with prior knowledge. Relying on the Bayesian framework, we will study the mechanisms by which prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents, by \"filling-in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness. 3) The maturation of consciousness: Using both psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, we will study the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants, and whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information, or rather anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control. The expected impact of the project will be 1) to evidence sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions 3) to provide new insights on the mystery of how consciousness develops in humans.",
