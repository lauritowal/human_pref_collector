        "This project posits that Ireland possesses a distinctive and largely unexplored heritage of engagement with classical Greek and Roman models. Despite never being part of the Roman Empire, Ireland has maintained a robust tradition of classical scholarship from its earliest recorded texts, a phenomenon unparalleled in other northern European nations. The research will delve into the underlying reasons for this unique cultural phenomenon by exploring nine key themes: language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence. This thematic approach will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the distinctive aspects of classical reception in Ireland, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue among fields such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, literature in English and Irish, medieval studies, postcolonialism, philosophy, material culture, women’s studies, and global studies.\n\nThe project will also address contemporary issues, including the ongoing centenary commemorations of the foundation of the independent Irish state (1912-1922, 2012-2022) and the persistent political and social divisions in Northern Ireland. These current concerns will serve as a catalyst for exploring broader historical contexts and their relevance to modern discourse. By doing so, the project aims to illuminate the profound impact of classical culture on Ireland’s literary, social, and political landscapes, offering fresh insights into the island’s rich and complex history."

Unlike Britain and mainland Europe, Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire. Yet the island has an extraordinarily vibrant tradition of classical learning that dates back to its earliest recorded literature, and is unparalleled in other northern European countries. Research for this project will address why this is the case, by examining sources through nine significant diachronic themes identified by the PI: language; land; travel and exile; Troy; satire; Neoplatonism; female voices; material culture; and global influence. This multi-thematic approach will enable analysis of what is remarkable about classical reception in Ireland. It will also provide a heuristic framework that generates dialogue between normally disparate fields, such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English-language literature, Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project will engage with contemporary preoccupations surrounding the politics and history of the divided island of Ireland, such as the current decade of centenary commemorations for the foundation of an independent Irish state (1912-1922, 2012-2022), and the on-going violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. These issues will serve as a springboard for opening new avenues of investigation that look far beyond the past 100 years, but are linked to them. The project will thus shed new light on the role of classical culture in shaping literary, social, and political discourse across the island of Ireland, and throughout its history.",
