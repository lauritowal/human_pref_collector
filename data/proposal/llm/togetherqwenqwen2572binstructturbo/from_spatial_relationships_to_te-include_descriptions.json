        "**Abstract:**\n\nGamma waves (30-80 Hz) are a critical feature of cortical activity during active wakefulness, essential for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Impairments in these waves are linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite their importance, the precise function of gamma waves in information processing remains unclear. This project proposes a novel theory that gamma waves in the visual cortex signal the match between top-down predictions and sensory inputs, rather than prediction errors as traditionally thought. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a method to quantify predictions and prediction errors using advanced deep-learning networks. We will conduct multi-areal recordings from the visual cortex in both marmosets and humans (using MEG) to investigate whether predictability indeed modulates gamma waves and their synchronization patterns. Additionally, we will explore the role of experience and perceptual learning in shaping these gamma dynamics. In marmosets, we will employ optogenetic techniques to assess whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning and to determine the influence of top-down feedback on V1 gamma waves. This research aims to provide robust evidence for a new, unified theory of gamma waves, elucidating their role in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictive models."

These waves are believed to be essential for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Their impairment is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, it remains heavily debated what gamma waves encode, and what their precise role in information transmission is. I have recently proposed a new theory about gamma in visual cortex, building on the predictive coding theory. The predictive coding theory holds that the brain makes active top-down predictions about its own sensory inputs. By comparing these, it generates bottom-up prediction errors to drive learning and the updating of priors. The standard view in predictive coding theories is that gamma waves carry prediction errors. However, I recently hypothesized the opposite: 1) Gamma waves signal a match between predictions and sensory inputs (i.e. predictability), and 2) Columns that predict each other's visual input engage in long-range gamma-synchronization. To test this hypothesis, it is critical to develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in the context of natural vision. I will solve this by using recently developed deep-learning networks for prediction. By making multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans (MEG), I will test if predictability indeed determines gamma waves and their synchronization pattern across space. Because stimulus priors have to be acquired through learning, I will further determine whether gamma waves depend on experience and perceptual learning. In marmosets, I will develop an optogenetics approach to test whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning, and test the prediction that V1 gamma waves depend on top-down feedback. In sum, I expect to provide evidence for a new, unified theory about the role of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions.",
