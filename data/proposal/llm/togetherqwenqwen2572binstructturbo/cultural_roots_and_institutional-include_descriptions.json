        "The teaching profession faces significant challenges, including low attractiveness, fragmentation, and shortages, which impact the future of educational systems. This grant proposal outlines a pioneering comparative study in Europe, focusing on the institutional dimensions that influence teachers' careers and the profession as a whole. The project aims to: [1] examine the evolution of teacher policies over the past three decades in Belgium, France, and England; [2] assess the changing status of the teaching profession and its effects on workforce diversity; [3] analyze the allocation processes that lead to varied working conditions for teachers; and [4] model and predict teacher attrition and mobility within a multilevel framework. Utilizing a post-comparative mixed-methods approach, the project is structured into four work packages: teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. Methods include policy analysis, secondary data analysis, in-depth qualitative studies, multilevel multi-group analyses, and interviews with non-entrants and early leavers. This research will generate new theoretical insights into teacher labor markets and contribute to understanding institutional changes in education, particularly in the context of declining nation-state influence and increased societal interdependence."

The functioning of the profession suffers from low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This proposal constitutes the first systematic comparative project in Europe aimed at understanding the role of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the teaching profession as a whole. It has four objectives: [1] to explain the nature of teacher policy over the last thirty years in different educational systems (Belgium, France and England); [2] to understand the changing status of the teaching profession and its impact on the diversification of the teaching workforce; [3] to analyse the processes by which teachers are allocated into increasingly diverse working and professional conditions; and [4] to model and predict teacher attrition and migration within a common but differentiated multilevel framework. This project will adopt a post-comparative mixed-method design organized around four work packages on teacher policy, supply, labour markets and mobility. It will combine five methods: policy analysis of teachers’ recruitment and careers; secondary data analyses of relevant national and international datasets on teacher supply and the profession’s attractiveness; a qualitative, in-depth study of three national labour-market spaces; multilevel multi-group analyses of original datasets on teacher mobility, and semi-structured interviews with non-entrants and early leavers. This project will produce new theoretical knowledge about labour markets for teachers and contribute to the reconceptualization of the nature of institutional change affecting educational systems in a society characterized by the progressive decline of nation states, increased interdependence between societal fields and the fragmentation of individual life spheres.",
