        "This project undertakes a socio-historical analysis of the shift in health governance paradigms from the post-World War II era to the present. Specifically, it examines the transition from the international public health regime, which focused on eradication policies, nation-states, and UN organizations, to the current global health regime, characterized by risk management, chronic disease control, and private-public partnerships. By investigating this transformation through the lenses of globalization, the project delves into the production of health knowledge, the commercialization of health products, and the implementation of public health programs across different settings. The study will concentrate on four key areas—tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics—to explore how specific health categories, treatment protocols, and management tools have evolved into global health governance instruments. Methodologically, the project combines historical and anthropological approaches, examining practices at both international and local levels, with a particular emphasis on the evolving role of the WHO and developments in non-Western countries, especially India. The anticipated outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of the social dynamics within laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations, a nuanced view of how global health practices are shaped by and emerge from local contexts, and insights into the circulation of health practices beyond traditional North-South divides. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the transition from the Cold War's political and economic order to the current neoliberal and multi-centric global health landscape."

The project seeks to understand this transition in terms of globalization processes, looking at the making of knowledge, the production and commercialization of health goods, the implementation of public health programs, and routine medical work. It will focus on four fields of investigations: tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine and medical genetics in order to understand how categories, standardized treatment regimens, industrial products, management tools or specific specialties have become elements in the global government of health. The project associates historical and anthropological investigations of practices in both international and local sites with strong interests in: a) the changing roles of WHO; b) the developments taking place in non-Western countries, India in the first place. The expected benefits of this research strategy are: a) to take into account social worlds including laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions and international organizations; b) to approach the global as something translated in and emerging from local practices and local knowledge; c) to explore different levels of circulations beyond the classical question of North-South transfers; d) to deepen our understanding of the transition from the political and economical order of the Cold War into a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty.",
