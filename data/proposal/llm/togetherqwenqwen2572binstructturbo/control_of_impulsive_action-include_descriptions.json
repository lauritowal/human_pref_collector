        "Impulsive actions, often regulated by an executive-control system, play a critical role in both healthy and pathological behaviors. Despite extensive research, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying impulse control, particularly due to a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory processes and well-rehearsed actions. This research proposal aims to address these gaps by investigating five key questions: (1) Can novel impulsive actions emerge during task-preparation phases? (2) What role do negative emotions play in the genesis and regulation of impulsive actions? (3) How does learning influence impulsive behavior over time? (4) Under what conditions are impulsive actions functional or dysfunctional? (5) How does variability in state impulsivity relate to trait impulsivity? To explore these questions, we will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining behavioral experiments, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS and EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making processes. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive model that integrates various aspects of impulsive action and executive control, ultimately replacing the prevailing 'inhibitory control' paradigm. This transformative model will enhance our understanding of individual differences in impulsivity and inform interventions for impulse-control disorders, benefiting both individuals and society."

Failures to regulate impulsive actions have been associated with a variety of clinical and behavioural disorders. Therefore, establishing a good understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and how to improve them could be hugely beneficial for both individuals and society at large. Yet many fundamental questions remain unanswered. This stems from a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory control and well-practiced actions. To make significant progress, we need to develop new models that integrate different aspects of impulsive action and executive control. The proposed research program aims to answer five fundamental questions. (1) Can novel impulsive actions arise during task-preparation stages?; (2) What is the role of negative emotions in the origin and control of impulsive actions?; (3) How does learning modulate impulsive behaviour?; (4) When are impulsive actions (dys)functional?; and (5) How is variation in state impulsivity associated with trait impulsivity? To answer these questions, we will use carefully designed behavioural paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (e.g. facial EMG), and mathematical modelling of decision-making to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions. Our ultimate goal is to transform the impulsive action field by replacing the currently dominant ‘inhibitory control’ models of impulsive action with detailed multifaceted models that can explain impulsivity and control across time and space. Developing a new behavioural model of impulsive action will also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of individual differences in impulsivity and the many disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.",
