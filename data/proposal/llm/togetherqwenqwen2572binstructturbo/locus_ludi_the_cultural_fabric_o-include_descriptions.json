        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Significance of Play in Ancient Societies,\" aims to explore the pervasive role of games and play in ancient Greek and Roman cultures. Despite the ubiquity of ludic activities across all social strata and genders, from childhood to old age, these aspects of ancient life have been largely overlooked in modern scholarship, often dismissed as trivial or merely juvenile. By integrating written, archaeological, and iconographic sources, this project seeks to reconstruct the rich tapestry of ludic culture from the emergence of the Greek city-state around 800 BCE to the fall of the Western Roman Empire around 500 CE. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological analyses, \"Locus Ludi\" will identify, categorize, and reconstruct the games and play practices of these ancient societies. The project will also examine how ludic culture reflected and influenced the gendered, religious, economic, and political structures of the time, as well as how it facilitated cultural exchange and integration, particularly during the Romanization process. By shedding light on the educational, societal, and integrative functions of play in the ancient world, this research will not only enrich our understanding of the past but also provide valuable insights into contemporary discussions on the role of play and new forms of social interaction in the digital age. The outcomes of this project will be disseminated through academic publications, educational materials, and public engagement initiatives, contributing to a broader and more nuanced appreciation of the cultural heritage of ancient societies."

Even gods played. Ludic culture created communities from early childhood to a ripe old age. Did these groups play together, or did they play different games, with distinct rules? And did they play similar games to us? This interdisciplinary project will provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence. Written, archaeological and iconographic sources are abundant, but forgotten in museums and libraries. This neglect is due to the modern Western view of games as childrenâ€™s pastime, if not a waste of time. Ancient play and games reflect the gendered, religious, economic, and political fabric of a society, as much as they shape the lives of players by transmitting a cultural identity and an intangible heritage. Ludic culture evolves over time and this project intends to provide a benchmark by reconstructing this history in the Greek world, from the birth of the city-state, c. 800 BCE, to the Roman conquest in 146 BCE, and in the Roman world from the Republican age, c. 500 BCE, to the end of the Western Roman Empire, c. 500 CE. Locus Ludi will identify, categorize, and reconstruct games and play thanks to close linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological studies. Ludic culture also mirrors interactions between different populations, as in the romanisation process, and religious shifts. The research will be informed by theoretical studies of the past as well as by gender and education studies. It will generate a new vision of the cultural fabric of ancient society, provide models for training and research in related fields, as well as up-to-date material for schools, museums, and libraries. Understanding the educational, societal and integrative role of play in the past is important to understand the present and widen the debate on high tech toys and new forms of sociability.",
