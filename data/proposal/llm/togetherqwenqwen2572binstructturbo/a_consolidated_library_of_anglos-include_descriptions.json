        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe CLASP (Consolidated Library and Analysis of Anglo-Saxon Poetry) project aims to create an innovative, online, and interactive library of all surviving verse from Anglo-Saxon England, spanning from approximately 670 to 1100 CE. This comprehensive resource will feature over 60,000 lines of poetry, equally divided between Old English and Anglo-Latin, and will be the first to systematically analyze and cross-reference the unique linguistic and thematic elements of these two literary traditions. By employing TEI P5 XML markup, CLASP will facilitate the identification of idiosyncrasies in sound, meter, spelling, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres, thereby revealing new connections and influences within and between the two languages. The corpus, primarily preserved in single manuscript witnesses, includes works by more than fifty named poets, as well as a significant body of anonymous Old English verse. Through a series of conferences, workshops, and publications, CLASP will demonstrate the transformative potential of this multilingual digital corpus for both scholarly research and broader public engagement, offering unprecedented access to the earliest poetry in England and fostering a deeper understanding of the cultural and literary dynamics of Anglo-Saxon England and its European context."

CLASP will focus on all surviving verse of Anglo-Saxon England, composed in Old English and Anglo-Latin over a period of over four centuries (c. 670â€“1100 CE), and produce for the first time an online and interactive consolidated library, marked up through TEI P5 XML to facilitate the identification of idiosyncratic features of sound, metre, spellings, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres across the entire corpus, so forging connections and suggesting more certain chains of influence both within and between the two main literary languages of Anglo-Saxon England. The bilingual corpus comprises almost 60,000 lines of poetry, with about half surviving in each language, and mostly appearing in only a single witness, usually in manuscript. More than fifty named poets are identified, many of them dateable with more or less precision, whose influence on each other can be closely documented, while in the case of anonymous verse, most of which is in Old English, the focus will be on tracing potential influence between texts, to establish a comparative rather than an absolute chronology. CLASP will use the full panoply of digital resources, including sound- and image-files where relevant, to make the oldest surviving poetry in England available to a modern audience for unprecedented kinds of exploration, comprehensive analysis, and interrogation, and in a series of conferences, workshops, and other publications will show the potential of such a comprehensive multilingual corpus to revolutionize perspectives not only on Anglo-Saxon England, but elsewhere in Europe, where Latin and the vernacular likewise co-existed in a Christian context across centuries.",
