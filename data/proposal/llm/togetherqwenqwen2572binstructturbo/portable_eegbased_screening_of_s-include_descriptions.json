        "This grant proposal aims to develop a pioneering, portable, and wireless EEG-based device tailored for assessing face processing in newborns, a critical indicator of social predispositions and potential markers for conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Building on our previous ERC-funded study, which identified a robust EEG-based index of face processing in newborns using an innovative oscillatory visual presentation, this project seeks to translate this scientific advancement into a practical, user-friendly tool. Currently, EEG recordings in newborns are confined to laboratory settings due to the lack of portable systems designed for this age group. Our proposed device will integrate our validated experimental paradigm, optimized for the limited visual attention span of newborns, with a lightweight, low-power, and wireless EEG system featuring dry electrodes. Furthermore, the device will incorporate an automated algorithm to extract the EEG-based index of face processing in real-time, facilitating rapid and objective assessments. This technology will not only enable early detection and intervention for infants at risk of ASD but also offer a versatile platform for exploring the neural foundations of various perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns. By making this advanced screening tool accessible in diverse settings, including home environments, we aim to revolutionize early childhood diagnostics and pave the way for large-scale screening initiatives."

An early detector of social predispositions and their impairment in newborns might provide a valuable biomarker for ASD, an indicator of utmost relevance since infants with ASD greatly benefit from early behavioral intervention. This proposal builds on a study performed within my ERC grant in which, by designing an innovative oscillatory visual presentation of face-like patterns and perceptually equivalent controls, we identified an EEG-based index of face processing, present in each newborn tested and obtainable with less than 2 minutes of newborn’s visual attention. However, recording newborn’s EEG is currently possible only in laboratory settings, as no fully portable EEG system adapted for newborns exists in the market. The goal of this proposal is to design a portable, wireless EEG-based device that allows easy, rapid and automatic testing of face processing in newborns in any context, including their homes. This device is ground-breaking because it will combine the efficacy of our innovative experimental paradigm tailored to newborn’s restricted visual attention with a portable, low-power, wireless EEG device based on dry electrodes and an automatic algorithm that will extract on-line the EEG-based index of face processing. Its realization will enable the development of an early, objective and easy-to-test EEG-based biomarker on newborns at risk, potentially opening the way to large-scale screening protocols. Given the flexibility of the paradigm with respect to the content of the visual stimulation, this method might be used for research purposes to explore the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns.",
