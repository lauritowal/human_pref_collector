        "This project aims to bridge the gap between molecular biology and historical linguistics, advancing our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between human populations and their languages. While previous attempts to correlate genetic markers with language families have faced criticism due to the limitations of existing linguistic classification methods, this proposal introduces a novel comparative approach grounded in grammatical evidence and contemporary advances in formal and typological linguistics. This method, developed by Longobardi and Guardiano (2009), offers unparalleled testability and reliability, enabling the measurement of linguistic distances even among distantly related populations. By integrating this linguistic framework with cutting-edge genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and uniparentally transmitted markers, our interdisciplinary team will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and linguistic diversity of selected populations. This collaboration between linguists and biologists will not only refine our understanding of the co-evolution of genes and languages but also provide a robust foundation for future research in both fields."

Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994) advocated a correspondence between some proposed language families and classical genetic markers, i.e. between biological evolution and transmission of cultural traits (languages), in agreement with Darwin’s (1859) prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. Their conclusions were variously criticised, and are especially undermined by the weakness of available language classification methods, mainly based on lexical (in a broad sense) material: these are either too narrow in scope (classical method) or probabilistically unreliable (Greenberg’s mass comparison) to provide solid long-range taxonomies to be matched against those of geneticists. We will address such issues with a radically new comparative method (Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) based entirely on grammatical evidence and on recent theoretical advances in formal and typological linguistics. The method ensures unprecedented standards of testability/replicability and can measure linguistic distances between even remote populations. Linguists and biologists will for the first time jointly select the populations most significant from either perspective for language/gene sampling. We will also adopt the newest powerful genetic tools of the last decade, both in terms of data (genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, including uniparentally transmitted markers of the Y chromosome and of mitochondrial DNA) and of biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.",
