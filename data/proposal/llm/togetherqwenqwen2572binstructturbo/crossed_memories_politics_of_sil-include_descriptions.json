        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Colonial Wars, Memory, and Legacy\" (CROME) aims to explore the complex and often conflicting memories of the colonial-liberation wars fought by Portugal and the African independence movements between 1961 and 1975. By adopting a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will examine how these wars, their colonial pasts, and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced over time in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe. Divided into two main strands, the project will first investigate the role of postcolonial states in shaping and recognizing these memories, often through selective representations. The second strand will delve into the diverse uses of the past, highlighting the dynamics between social and individual memories. CROME hypothesizes that the wars, as pivotal moments in the transition from colonial rule to independence, have generated distinct processes of memorialization and silencing, each with its own historical trajectory. By analyzing these processes, the project seeks to provide a groundbreaking perspective on colonial-liberation war studies, offering insights into how these conflicts have shaped contemporary identities and historical narratives. Ultimately, CROME aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the legacy of European colonialism, potentially aiding in the resolution of enduring historical tensions."

The project’s main challenge is to produce innovative knowledge about the memories of the wars fought by the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements between 1961 and 1974/5. The approach chosen is simultaneously diachronic and comparative, inasmuch as it contrasts changes that took place between the end of the conflicts and nowadays, regarding how wars, colonial pasts and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that wars - as pivotal moments that ended the cycle of Empire in Portugal and started the cycle of African independences in the former Portuguese colonies - triggered memorialisation and silencing processes which had their own historicity. CROME is divided into two strands. The first one, named ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States’, looks at the role played by the states under consideration in mobilising, articulating and recognising the past, but also in actively generating selective representations. ‘Memory as a battlefield’ is the second strand, which will highlight distinct uses of the past and dynamics between social memories and individual memories. The project intends to demonstrate how wars gave rise to multiple memories and conflicting historical judgements, mostly in Portugal, but also to examine how the specific nature of the (post-)colonial histories of each African country has generated different ways to summon war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies. CROME will, thus, put forward a ground-breaking perspective in terms of colonial-liberation war studies, and will be instrumental in dealing with such traumatic experience, for its comparative approach might help overcoming everlasting constraints still at play today, caused by the historical burden European colonialism left behind.",
