        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to bridge critical knowledge gaps in understanding the interplay between poverty eradication and climate change. The project will develop a comprehensive framework to quantify the energy requirements and associated climate impacts of achieving decent living standards globally. By integrating insights from global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, the research will address three core questions: (1) What goods and services, and their specific characteristics, are essential for a decent living standard? (2) What are the energy resources needed to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what are the resulting climate impacts? (3) How do the components of decent living and their energy needs change as countries develop? The first phase will operationalize the concept of basic needs by analyzing household consumption patterns to identify essential goods and services. The second phase will employ lifecycle and input-output analysis to quantify the energy needs and emissions associated with these goods and services, considering cultural, climatic, and technological factors in five emerging economies. The final phase will explore the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity over time, using empirical data to identify trends and path dependencies. This research will provide actionable insights for policymakers, helping to align poverty eradication efforts with climate mitigation goals and inform fair burden-sharing arrangements."

This is due to knowledge gaps related to the material basis of poverty, and the relationship between energy and human development. Addressing this issue rigorously requires bridging gaps between global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, and applying this knowledge to projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This project will develop a body of knowledge that quantifies the energy needs and related climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all. The research will address three questions: which goods and services, and with what characteristics, constitute ‘decent living standards’? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what impact will this energy use have on climate change? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? The first task will operationalize basic needs views of human development and advance their empirical validity by discerning characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. The second will quantify the energy needs (and climate-related emissions) for decent living constituents and reveal their dependence on culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions in countries. This will be done using lifecycle analysis and input-output analysis, and mapping energy to climate change using state-of-the-art energy-economy integrated assessment modelling tools for 5 emerging economies that face the challenges of eradicating poverty and mitigating climate change. The third task will shed light on path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity using empirical analysis. This research will identify opportunities to shift developing societies towards low-carbon pathways, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation.",
