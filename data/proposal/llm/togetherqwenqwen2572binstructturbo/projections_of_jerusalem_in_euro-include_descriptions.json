        "This grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project aimed at documenting, analyzing, and conceptualizing the extensive, multimedia, and interactive recreations of Jerusalem found across Europe. These unique monuments, which number in the hundreds, meticulously replicate the loca sancta, featuring detailed architectural, sculptural, and decorative elements that evoke the original holy sites. Despite their widespread presence, these sites have never been the subject of a comprehensive study, leaving significant gaps in our understanding of their cultural and historical significance. This project seeks to fill these gaps by systematically documenting these monuments, cross-referencing textual and field data, and identifying key clusters of related sites. Through a comparative analysis and the application of theoretical frameworks such as iconography, spatial theory, and interactive media, the project will explore the relationships between original and copy, narrative and icon, and the formation of sacred spaces. The research will also contribute to the broader discourse on pilgrimage, devotional practices, and mnemonic traditions. Methodologically, the project will involve extensive fieldwork, textual analysis, and collaborative discussions, culminating in a series of publications, symposia, and a final book. This initiative promises to open a new chapter in the study of religious and cultural heritage, offering fresh insights and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue."

These monuments represent the loca sancta through architectures in spatial and topographical relationships that reproduce the real ones, sculptural groups that re-enact the respective event in a painted d√©cor, with artifacts completing the ambience. The project proposes to document, comprehensively study and conceptualize these sites. Their exact number is not known since a comprehensive study has never yet been attempted, but they can probably be numbered in many hundreds. This project will open up a totally new research area with considerable impact already at the initial documentation and survey stages, by bringing together both fresh data and interpretations. But the project proposes to go beyond and generate many new insights by a comparative study of the sites and a conceptualization of the phenomenon (with the aid of notions such as icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, space and place). The study will lead to the integration of these three-dimensional complexes in the ongoing discourse of image, and to the theoretical discourse pertaining to the relationships between original and copy, narrative and iconic. It will contribute essential new insights to the study of pilgrimage, the definition and process of the formation of sacred spaces, to devotionalism as a special type of piety and to the study of memory and mnemonic practices. Research will include field and textual documentation, cross referencing and grouping of related monuments, leading to crystallization of several clusters of monuments, representative at Pan-European and historical levels. Research will be accompanied by a conclusion-reaching process through discussions in small groups, exchange of working papers, as well as symposia and conferences with external participation. The results will be published throughout the stages of work, as well as in a book at the end of the research period.",
