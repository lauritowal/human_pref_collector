        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe modulation of eating behavior by post-ingestive feedback is a critical area of study, influencing dietary choices and consumption patterns. In rodents, post-oral administration of sugars has been shown to elicit striatal dopamine release, reinforcing food preferences. However, the mechanisms underlying this process in humans remain poorly understood. Preliminary experiments in our lab, which controlled for pre-ingestive stimulation, replicated increased consumption of conditioned flavors but did not observe changes in the pleasantness of these stimuli, suggesting that post-ingestive reinforcement may influence the value of actions rather than the associated sensory cues. To address this gap, the CalorieRL project will integrate computational reinforcement learning models with instrumental conditioning paradigms, functional and molecular brain imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Our primary hypothesis is that post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior has a dopaminergic basis and is mediated by neural activity in reward circuits, with sensory information transmitted via the vagus nerve. Additionally, we will explore the relevance of these mechanisms in the context of obesity, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets. By elucidating the neural and computational underpinnings of post-ingestive reinforcement, CalorieRL seeks to advance our understanding of the complex interplay between sensory feedback and eating behavior, with implications for both basic science and public health."

Selection of food is guided by sensory feedback, including post-ingestive information about energy content, that has been studied across several species, paradigms and nutrients. In rodents, post-oral administration of sugar is associated with striatal dopamine release and conditions robust preferences, in part as a result of viscerosensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Consistently, in humans there is evidence that pairing a flavour with a tasteless carbohydrate will enhance pleasantness of the pre-ingestive stimulus and increase its consumption. However, available data in humans have provided limited mechanistic underpinnings for this process and, in our own experiments, performed with greater control of pre-ingestive stimulation, while we reproduced increased consumption of conditioned flavours, we found no evidence for post-ingestive mediated changes of pleasantness. Critically, this suggests that the impact of nutrient conditioning on behaviour and choice reflects the modulation of the value of actions, rather than that of associated stimuli. The application of computational reinforcement learning theory to human probabilistic decision-making tasks, which has allowed for renewed sophistication and progress to understand the mechanisms of appetitive learning, is yet to be applied to address this question. In CalorieRL, we will use computational reinforcement models applied to instrumental conditioning, in addition to brain functional and molecular imaging and peripheral nerve stimulation, to study post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behaviour. We hypothesize such behaviour has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits, resulting from sensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Importantly, we will also address if post-ingestive reinforcement is relevant in the context of obesity.",
