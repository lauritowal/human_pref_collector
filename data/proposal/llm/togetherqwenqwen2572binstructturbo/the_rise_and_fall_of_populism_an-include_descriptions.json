        "This project aims to explore the multifaceted causes and consequences of populism in advanced democracies, focusing on the role of negative economic shocks and their interaction with personal experiences and information environments. The research is divided into three main components. First, we will investigate how individual employment histories, shaped by globalization and technological changes, along with personal predispositions and media exposure, influenced support for Donald Trump. Utilizing a unique database of over 40 million resumes from 2010-2016, the largest of its kind, we will match this data with zip-code level economic and voting patterns to uncover the nuanced effects of personal and aggregate economic shocks.\n\nSecond, we will examine the long-term impacts of negative social experiences during formative years on labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and political preferences. Specifically, we will analyze how corporal punishment in UK schools during the 1970s and 1980s affected educational attainment, employment, and support for populist movements like UKIP and Brexit. This will involve digitizing and analyzing archival records of corporal punishment practices and combining them with contemporary outcome data.\n\nFinally, we will study the determinants of resistance to extremist regimes, using the historical context of resistance to the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II. By analyzing a self-collected dataset of treason cases and integrating it with data on bombing and foreign propaganda exposure, we will identify the factors that compel individuals to resist extremism despite significant personal risks. This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between economic shocks, personal experiences, and political behavior, offering insights that are crucial for addressing contemporary challenges in democratic societies."

Is populism caused by negative economic shocks? If so, what are the mechanisms? What explains heterogeneity in responses to such shocks? In this project, I will test empirically if personal experiences, information environment, and their interaction with aggregate economic shocks shape peopleâ€™s political decisions. The project consists of three parts. First, I will study how personal employment histories, potentially affected by globalization and technological shocks, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting for Trump. I will use a unique database of more than 40 million resumes for the period 2010-2016, the largest available repository of resumes of job-seekers in the US, which was not previously used in academic research, and match it with zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, I will study how negative social experiences during the formative years affect subsequent labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and the support of populist agenda. I will examine how corporal punishment in schools in UK affected subsequent educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting for UKIP and Brexit. I will digitize archival records on regulations and practice of corporal punishment in different educational authorities in the UK during 1970-80s, combining it with contemporary outcomes. Third, I will examine what makes people actively resist extremist regimes even when it is associated with high personal costs. I will study a historical example of resistance to Nazi regime in Germany during the WWII, which provides unique methodological opportunity to study determinants of resistance to extremism in a high stake environment. I will use a self-collected dataset on treason cases to measure resistance, combining it with data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda.",
