        "This grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project aimed at uncovering the interconnected histories of Eastern Christianity during the early modern period. Spanning from the sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth century, the project will explore the global migrations of Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. By integrating a wide array of sources from archives, chanceries, and libraries across three continents and ten languages, the project seeks to reconstruct a 'lost archive' that documents the experiences and contributions of these communities. Under the leadership of the Principal Investigator, a team of researchers will analyze these materials to provide a comprehensive understanding of the transnational nature of Eastern Christian history. The project's dissemination strategy will bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, addressing the challenge of linking micro-level everyday life to macro-historical narratives. The outcomes will include scholarly publications, workshops, and a searchable database of writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750, thereby advancing a rigorous form of global history that emphasizes philology and source criticism."

Too often, however, this global migration has been seen purely as a modern development, one arising from contemporary political and confessional events in the Middle East, while in fact this phenomenon had its roots in the early modern period. From the sixteenth century onwards, Christians from the Ottoman Empire set out for distant worlds and foreign lands, travelling as far as Europe, India, Russia, and even the Americas and leaving traces of themselves across countless European and Middle Eastern archives, chanceries, and libraries. This transnational, ground-breaking project will gather all of these disparate sources into a single analytical frame to uncover, for the first time, the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Through the work of a team of researchers under the close supervision of the PI, the project will reconstitute and analyse a ‘lost archive’ of literary, documentary, and printed sources in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of archives. Under the expert leadership of the PI, the project will include a robust strategy for dissemination, which will successfully bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history. In doing so, this project will respond directly to one of the most pressing conceptual challenges facing global history today, that is, how to link the study of the micro-scale level of everyday life to the macro-narratives emphasised by global historians. Underlying this project, therefore, is a major intervention that seeks to advance a rigorous form of global history, and one which preserves philology and source criticism at the heart of its methodology. The outcomes of the project will include print-publications, workshops, and a searchable database of all writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750.",
