    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the transformative impact of creative Artificial Intelligence (AI) on our understanding of art, culture, and society. By leveraging music as a platform, we aim to foster public engagement and deepen our comprehension of how AI reshapes our interactions with technology and each other. The project is structured into three work packages: 1) the development of musical instruments enhanced with creative AI; 2) the integration of AI in human-AI collaborative music creation; and 3) the use of sonic instruments as tools for scientific inquiry. Through these packages, we will initiate a public dialogue on creative AI and construct a theoretical framework that elucidates the evolving concepts of self, others, and knowledge in the context of intelligent instruments. This interdisciplinary endeavor brings together experts from diverse fields, employing a novel research collaboration protocol to advance the frontiers of intelligent instrument studies. The outcomes will address the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and provide insights into the societal implications of AI. Led by a renowned authority in new instrument and music software development, with a background in music, philosophy, computer science, and AI, the project will contribute to multiple disciplines by establishing a theoretical foundation for creative AI, promoting a human-centered approach to AI collaboration, and defining ethical guidelines for AI design in various applications."

But what does this mean? How does creative AI change our notions of art, culture and society? As new machine learning technologies begin to mirror ourselves, we need to look into that mirror and ask how this is changing us. This project takes a pioneering leap in research about AI by answering how new creative AI transforms our relationships with technology and other people. This ambitious vision is achieved by using music as a platform to establish public understanding of AI. Three respective work packages will develop: 1) instruments with creative AI; 2) human-AI collaboration in music; and 3) sonic instruments as scientific instruments. The project initiates a public discourse on creative AI and develops a theoretical framework describing the transformed notions of self, others and knowledge when we adopt intelligent instruments in our work. INTENT is interdisciplinary in nature. Applying the methodology of our new research collaboration protocol, we summon researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct frontier science on intelligent instruments as boundary objects. Through open science methods the outcomes will address: a) the role of creative AI in embodied technologies, and b) the understanding and reflection of artificial intelligence in future society. The PI is an established authority on new instruments and music software development. His interdisciplinary background in music, philosophy and computer science and AI, together with impactful academic leadership roles make him uniquely placed to lead this radical research programme. Grounded equally in technology development and the humanities, the project will benefit diverse disciplines by developing a theoretical framework of creative AI, initiating a discourse around human-centred creative AI, and defining principles of ethical AI design in services and products.",
