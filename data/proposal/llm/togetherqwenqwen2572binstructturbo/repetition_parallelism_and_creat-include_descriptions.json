        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe REPAC project aims to deepen our understanding of the intellectual history of Ancient Mesopotamia by examining the intricate relationship between textual form and function in Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions. Specifically, it focuses on the use of exact and variant repetition as a fundamental structuring device in these texts. By analyzing literary, magical, and mantic texts inscribed in Cuneiform script in the Akkadian language from the first millennium BCE, REPAC explores how repetition serves not only as an aesthetic ornament but also as a crucial tool for rhetorical effectiveness, poetic creativity, and argumentative inventiveness. The project highlights the significance of parallelism, refrains, and ring composition in these texts, demonstrating how these repetitive patterns were employed to construct persuasive analogies, elucidate complex themes, and facilitate magical action. The scribes' belief in the meaningful and causally effective interconnection of similar words, concepts, and things underpins the widespread use of repetition. This project fills a significant gap in our knowledge of Mesopotamian intellectual methods, offering a comprehensive understanding of the creative and scholarly practices of one of the world's earliest civilizations."

The project investigates the relationship between textual form and function in Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions. It focuses on exact and variant repetition as a text structuring device and demonstrates that the use of repetition is grounded in a fundamental aspect of the worldview of Mesopotamian learned scribes. REPAC studies literary, magical and mantic texts written on clay tablets inscribed in the Cuneiform script in the Akkadian language dating from the first millennium BCE. Parallelism, refrain, ring composition and similar types of regular, part-repetitive patterning occur on all levels of these erudite textual genres. Textual elements which are separate but yoked together through contiguity and similarity were a major vector for poetic creativity, rhetorical effectiveness and inventiveness in argumentation. Repetition in its various forms was used not only as a means of aesthetic ornamentation. In mantic texts, it opened a way to understand the world through analogical reasoning. Literary texts constructed arguments by elucidating different aspects of their theme through sequences of parallel, but slightly divergent, statements. In magical rituals, repetition was used for magical action through the construction of persuasive analogies. The ubiquity of textual repetition was rooted in the scribes’ belief in the meaningful and causally effective interconnection of words, concepts and things sharing an element of similarity. No sustained effort at understanding this worldview and the importance of analogy as a principle of Mesopotamian literary and scholarly method has ever been made. The project fills this major knowledge gap. It will lead to a significantly improved understanding of the creative effort of Ancient Mesopotamia.",
