        "The formation of social bonds, a fundamental aspect of human evolution, has been extensively studied by social scientists and neuroscientists, often in isolation. This proposal seeks to bridge these domains by focusing on adolescence, a period of profound social and neurological transformation. By integrating social network analysis with social neuroscience, we aim to elucidate the reciprocal relationship between changes in the social brain and social network dynamics during this critical developmental stage. Our study will follow a cohort of approximately 1000 adolescents across 50 classes, with six assessments over three years. A subset of 100 participants will undergo annual fMRI scans to examine task-related functional activation and connectivity. We will employ experimental tasks to assess neural and behavioral correlates of social cognition, including understanding and interacting with others, complemented by ecological momentary assessments and mobile sensing to map social networks. This comprehensive approach will provide insights into how the social brain influences and is influenced by the social environment, offering a nuanced understanding of adolescent social development."

Social scientists have scrutinized the structure of the elaborate social networks that characterize todayâ€™s society. Neuroscientists have elucidated the brain mechanisms underlying our ability to navigate this social world. Yet, these research lines have been largely separated. This proposal aims to integrate social network research and social brain research, focusing on adolescence as the most dynamic phase shaping the interplay between social networks and the social brain. Social development in adolescents is clearly driven by maturation of specific social-cognitive functions; yet these functions are manifest in, and moulded by, interpersonal relationships within social networks. I aim to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development. This can be achieved by using the quantitative tools of social network analysis in conjunction with the experimental approach of social neuroscience. I plan to investigate a cohort of approximately 1000 adolescents nested in 50 classes in a longitudinal design with 6 measurements over 3 years; fMRI investigating task-related functional activation and connectivity is conducted yearly in a subsample of 100. The neural and behavioural correlates of social cognition are investigated using experimental tasks tapping i) understanding others and ii) interacting with others; social behaviour is charted through ecological momentary assessment techniques; social networks are mapped using surveys and digital information acquired routinely via mobile phones (mobile sensing). This approach clarifies how during a crucial developmental phase the social brain shapes the social environment, and vice versa, the social environment influences maturation of the social brain.",
