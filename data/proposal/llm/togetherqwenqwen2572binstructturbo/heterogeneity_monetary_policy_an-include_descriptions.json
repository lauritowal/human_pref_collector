        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to deepen our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy, particularly through the lens of Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models. The primary goal is to develop an \"organizing framework\" that distinguishes between two types of agents—those who are unconstrained and those who are constrained by their inability to satisfy intertemporal optimality conditions. This framework will enable the identification of a heterogeneity wedge, which captures the differential behavior of aggregate consumption or investment compared to a representative agent economy. By analyzing the components of this wedge, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms through which heterogeneity influences economic dynamics, both in theoretical HANK models and in real-world economies using panel data.\n\nA secondary objective is to conduct a comparative analysis of the aggregate equilibrium dynamics of HANK and Two-Agent New Keynesian (TANK) models. TANK models, while preserving the tractability and interpretability of the standard Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) model, introduce a simplified form of heterogeneity by assuming a fixed proportion of constrained and unconstrained agents. The research will explore whether a TANK model can approximate the dynamics of HANK models and provide a better fit to empirical data than RANK models. Applications of this research include the examination of how constrained households affect the benefits of wage flexibility and the impact of monetary policy interventions, such as helicopter drops, on economic outcomes. Additionally, the study will investigate the role of heterogeneity in shaping optimal monetary policy."

A first objective is the development of an “organizing framework” which focuses on the distinction between two types of agents of households (or firms) at any point in time: those who satisfy an intertemporal optimality condition (labeled as “unconstrained”) and those who do not (labeled as “constrained”). A heterogeneity wedge can be defined that accounts for the differential behavior of aggregate consumption (or investment) relative to an economy with a representative household (or firm). The analysis of that wedge and its components should help understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates, both in the context of specific HANK models as well as actual economies (using household or firm-level panel data). A second objective is the conduct of a comparative analysis of the aggregate equilibrium dynamics of HANK and TANK (for Two Agent New Keynesian) models. The latter class of models, which preserve the tractability and ease of interpretation of the standard Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) model, restrict the heterogeneity to the presence of two types of agents (constrained and unconstrained), with a constant share of each in the population. The key question to be studied is the extent to which some version of a TANK model may provide a good approximation to the dynamics of existing HANK models, as well as a better data fit than their RANK counterparts. Several applications are proposed, including the analysis of the role of constrained households in shaping the gains from wage flexibility and in determining the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, as well as the study of the impact of heterogeneity on the nature of the optimal monetary policy.",
