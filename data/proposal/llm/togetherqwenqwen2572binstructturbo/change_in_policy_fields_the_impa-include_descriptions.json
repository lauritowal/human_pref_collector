        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe MORAPOL project aims to make significant empirical and theoretical contributions to the understanding of morality policies. Empirically, it is the first comprehensive study to systematically analyze the development of morality policies over a 30-year period (1980-2010) in 25 OECD countries. The project examines three key subfields: \"life and death\" issues (abortion, euthanasia), sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality), and addictive substances and behaviors. By comparing these subfields across countries, MORAPOL seeks to uncover changing patterns and trends in morality policy. Theoretically, the project introduces a novel approach by developing explanations for changes in entire policy fields, rather than focusing on individual policies. This holistic perspective represents a significant departure from existing frameworks. To achieve these objectives, MORAPOL employs a mixed-methods approach. Initially, a macro-quantitative analysis is conducted using legislative output data. This is followed by qualitative case studies of \"critical\" cases—those that challenge the theoretical model's predictions. Through this integrated methodology, MORAPOL aims to provide a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of morality policy change."

First, MORAPOL takes an innovative empirical focus. It is the first to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies. This policy area is so far unexplored from a policy-analytical perspective. The focus is on changing patterns of morality policy over time, across countries and policy subfields. The project compares morality policies in 25 OECD countries over a period of thirty years (1980 \u0013 2010). It involves a comparison across different subfields of morality policy, including (1) policies on \"life and death\" (abortion, euthanasia), (2) sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality) and (3) addictive substances and addictive behaviour. Second, the project is conceptually innovative. The theoretical aim is to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields rather than for individual policies or policy items. This holistic approach constitutes a path-breaking departure from existing concepts. This way, it is for the first time possible to develop theories that account for changes in whole policy fields or subfields. To systematically assess the influence of international and domestic factors on morality policy change, MORAPOL adopts a mixed-methods approach. In a first step, a macro-quantitative analysis is undertaken, based on legislative output data for the subfields and countries under study. This analysis is in a second step complemented with qualitative case studies. The case studies are selected on the basis of the results of the quantitative study, which turn out to be “critical” cases; i.e. cases that are apparently incorrectly predicted by the theoretical model.",
