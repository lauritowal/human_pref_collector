        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe BEMOTHER project aims to develop a comprehensive, integrative model of the biological, cognitive, and psychological adaptations that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, essential for maternal behavior. Building on our pioneering research, which identified significant and lasting reductions in gray matter volume in the social-cognition network during pregnancy, BEMOTHER will explore the onset, evolution, and dynamics of these changes. The project will employ a prospective longitudinal design with five assessment points: one pre-pregnancy, two during pregnancy, and two postpartum. We will collect neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data from three groups: nulliparous women experiencing pregnancy, nulliparous women whose same-sex partners are pregnant, and a control group of nulliparous women. Our objectives include: (i) delineating the timeline and progression of brain changes during pregnancy and postpartum; (ii) characterizing cognitive, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures; (iii) evaluating the impact of environmental and psychological factors on maternal adaptations; (iv) identifying metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations; and (v) integrating these findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. By providing both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses, BEMOTHER will offer a pioneering, RDoC-based model of maternal adaptations, addressing the interplay between different functional domains at multiple levels of analysis. This innovative project will significantly advance our understanding of the complex processes involved in preparing for and adapting to motherhood."

We were the first group to find (1, 2) that pregnancy is associated with consistent, pronounced and long-lasting reductions in cerebral gray matter (GM) volume in areas of the social-cognition network. The aim of BEMOTHER is to develop an integrative model of the adaptations for motherhood that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period by: i) establishing when the brain of pregnant women begins to change and how it evolves; ii) characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding and psychiatric measures; iii) assessing the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors in the maternal adaptations, iv) identifying the metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and v) integrating the previous findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework (RDoC) (3). We will use a prospective longitudinal design at 5 time points (1 pre-pregnancy session, 2 intra-pregnancy sessions and 2 postpartum sessions) during which neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral and metabolomics data will be acquired in 3 groups of women: a group of nulliparous women who will be undergoing a full-term pregnancy, another group of nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo a full-term pregnancy, and a group of control nulliparous women. We will provide the longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, but we will also deliver intermediate longitudinal evaluations after the postpartum session, as well as cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session. BEMOTHER is timely and innovative. It adopts the translational RDoC framework in order to provide a pioneering, comprehensive and dynamic characterization of the adaptations for motherhood, addressing the interaction among different functional domains at different levels of analysis.",
