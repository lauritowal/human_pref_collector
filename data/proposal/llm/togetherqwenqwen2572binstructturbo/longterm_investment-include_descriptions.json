        "In the evolving landscape of the 21st-century economy, the success of firms is increasingly contingent upon their ability to invest in intangible assets, such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. This shift presents a significant challenge, as the benefits of such investments often materialize over extended periods, potentially conflicting with the short-term financial pressures faced by management. This project aims to explore the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three integrated components. First, we will investigate the role of financial markets in promoting long-term investment. By examining how market mechanisms reward past investments and inform future decisions, we seek to understand the conditions under which financial markets effectively support long-term strategies. Second, we will delve into the design of incentive structures that align managerial and organizational goals with long-term outcomes. This includes both theoretical analysis and empirical research to identify the optimal horizon for incentives, as well as exploring how these principles can be applied to other sectors, such as education, to encourage a focus on long-term development. Finally, we will gather and analyze data on corporate social responsibility and its impact on firm value, providing concrete evidence of the benefits of long-term investment. Through these components, the project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and promoting sustainable long-term investment in modern firms."

The 21st-century firm is different. Competitive success increasingly depends on product quality, which in turn hinges on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. Unlike tangible investment such as buying a factory, the fruits of intangible investment may take several years to appear. A manager pressured to maximise short-term earnings may fail to invest, jeopardising the long-term future of his firm. This project will study the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three linked components. Financial Markets. The traditional view is that financial markets dissuade investment by forcing firms to cater to short-term shareholders. I will study two channels through which markets promote investment. First, traders gather information about a firm’s past investments and incorporate it into stock prices by trading - rewarding the manager for good investment. Second, traders can gather information about a firm’s future investment opportunities - informing the manager about his future investment decisions. I aim to analyse what determines the efficiency of both channels. Incentives. Most research on incentives focuses on either the level of pay, or the sensitivity of pay to performance, but it is the horizon of incentives that is key to promoting investment. I will theoretically analyse the optimal incentive horizon, and empirically demonstrate how it affects long-term decisions. Moving beyond managers, I will study how to incentivise teachers to focus on their pupils’ long-run development rather than “teaching-to-the-test.” Effects of Investment. A key to inducing long-run investment is to demonstrate its benefits, but this is difficult due to data availability. I aim to gather data on a firm’s corporate social responsibility – its investment in its stakeholders – and link it to firm value.",
