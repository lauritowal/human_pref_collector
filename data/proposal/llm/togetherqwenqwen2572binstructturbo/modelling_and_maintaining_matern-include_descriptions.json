        "Pregnancy loss is a significant yet underexplored factor in global health, often leading to severe mental health issues for women and their families. Despite recent advances in understanding the brain changes associated with pregnancy and motherhood, the impact of pregnancy loss on maternal brain plasticity remains largely uncharted. The HealthyMom project aims to investigate the neural and psychological consequences of early and late pregnancy loss, focusing on the brain's response to the abrupt termination of pregnancy. By employing a multimodal approach that integrates brain imaging, hormonal assessments, and comprehensive mental health monitoring, we will collect longitudinal data from women who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth. This data will be complemented by whole genome sequencing of both the women and their partners, enabling us to explore the genetic and environmental factors that influence mental health outcomes. Advanced computational models will be used to analyze these data, identifying brain imaging patterns and genetic signatures associated with vulnerability to mental disorders. The project's findings will provide critical insights into the neurogenetic mechanisms underlying post-pregnancy loss mental health, offering new targets for interventions and support strategies. Ultimately, HealthyMom has the potential to significantly enhance the mental and physical health of women and their future offspring."

While we have started to gain insights into how pregnancy shapes the female brain toward motherhood, the impact of the abrupt termination of pregnancy on maternal brain plasticity remains largely unknown. Here, I seek to study traces of unwanted terminated pregnancy following early and late pregnancy loss in the female brain, understanding to what degree motherhood associated changes in brain anatomy and function are formed back when a pregnancy is lost. I aim to identify traces and determinants of afflicted mental health in this period of profound vulnerability and (self-)stigmatization. Leveraging my portfolio of expertise in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, the HealthyMom project will acquire unique longitudinal data of the weeks and months following early miscarriage or stillbirth. Specifically, women will undergo repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessment and a comprehensive monitoring of their mental health. I will perform whole genome sequencing, not only of the women but also of their life partners. Together with detailed surveys, this will allow me to uncover how individual brain trajectories relate to environmental levers for mental health maintenance and to genetic risk factors, including genetic effects of the partners on the women. The project will draw on existing big data and advanced computational modelling techniques to chart individual brain imaging patterns in the context of the population norm. As such, HealthyMom offers unprecedented opportunities to understand female-specific brain dynamics and to reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability as well as targets for maintaining maternal mental health. It has significant implications for womenâ€™s health and (indirectly) the health of future offspring.",
