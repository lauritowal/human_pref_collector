        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"Firm Dynamics and Globalization: Implications for Welfare and Policy,\" aims to enhance our understanding of the decision-making processes of firms in a globalized economy. By examining the sources of firm growth and market power, this project seeks to provide novel insights into the welfare implications and policy design in a dynamic, innovative, and competitive economic landscape. Despite the prevailing paradigm of efficient market allocation, large firms, particularly those with significant international presence, play a dominant role in shaping economic activity. This research will explore how these firms grow, the effects of their market power on the distribution of gains from globalization, and the broader implications for policy. Over the next five years, the project will integrate advanced firm behavior models into the study of international trade, focusing on how trade and industrial policies influence the growth trajectory, especially in less developed markets. Key research questions include: how can trade and competition policies ensure consumer benefits in the presence of market power, how do domestic policies to support agribusiness firms impact small farmers, how do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages, and what role does banking globalization play in the real sector growth of firms? Utilizing a combination of theoretical frameworks and empirical data from developing economies, this research will contribute to the expansion of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, ultimately informing more effective and inclusive policymaking."

The objective of my future research is to provide such an analysis. BIGlobal will examine the sources of firm growth and market power to provide new insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Much of analysis of the global economy is set in the paradigm of markets that allocate resources efficiently and there is little role for policy. But big firms dominate economic activity, especially across borders. How do firms grow and what is the effect of their market power on the welfare impact of globalization? This project will determine how firm decisions matter for the aggregate gains from globalization, the division of these gains across different individuals and their implications for policy design. Over the next five years, I will incorporate richer firms behaviour in models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact the growth process, especially in less developed markets. The specific questions I will address include: how can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms engaged in international trade have market power, how do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect the extent to which small farmers gain from trade, how do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages, and what is the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector. Each project will combine theoretical work with rich data from developing economies to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and to provide a basis for informed policymaking.",
