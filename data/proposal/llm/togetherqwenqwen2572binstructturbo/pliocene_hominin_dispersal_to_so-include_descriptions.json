        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to explore the early evolution of human behavioral and physiological flexibility, focusing on Plio-Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa. By investigating the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, we will create dynamic palaeo-precipitation and vegetation models from various archives. Detailed anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record will be conducted to understand species diversity, functional adaptations, and dispersal patterns. Our research will test three key hypotheses: 1) East African hominin ranges expanded and contracted with wet and dry phases, leading to reproductive isolation of southern populations; 2) from 2.6 to 1.5 million years ago, the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and changes in the Kalahari basin's drainage pattern resulted in intermittent gene flow between East African and South African hominins; 3) after 1.5 million years ago, tectonic and hydrographic changes, particularly the formation of the Zambezi River, led to endemism and competitive exclusion among South African hominins, resulting in distinct ecological niches. This interdisciplinary approach will provide crucial insights into the environmental and evolutionary factors that shaped early human dispersal and adaptation."

This trait facilitated their dispersal out-of-Africa to higher latitudes, i.e. to temperate and seasonal habitats, during the Pleistocene. However, there are Plio-Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa (SA) from ~3.7Ma onwards. Did human behavioural/physiological flexibility evolve early in our evolutionary history? Alternatively, did Pliocene hominins occupy such temperate zones due to different palaeoclimatic conditions in deep time and/or due to stochastic events? To untangle these questions this project will: (1) determine the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, (2) create dynamic palaeo-precipitation/-vegetation models from various archives, (3) carry out detailed anatomical, functional and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record and (4) combine the datasets to appraise species diversity (functional adaptations), geneflow (hybridization) and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography). 3 key working hypotheses underlie the proposal: 1. >2.6Ma East African (EA) hominin ranges expanded/contracted in accord with wet and dry phases; periodically, the southernmost populations became reproductively isolated. Early SA hominins represent descendants of Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, respectively. 2. ~2.6-1.5Ma With the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the re-organisation of the drainage pattern within the Kalahari basin, dispersal corridors repeatedly closed (vicariance) and opened, resulting in intermittent levels of gene flow (i.e. hybridization) between EA and SA hominins. 3. <~1.5Ma Tectonic and hydrographic changes led to the Zambezi River becoming a powerful barrier during the Pleistocene. SA hominins younger than 1.5Ma are likely the result of endemism; competitive exclusion amongst these hominins resulted in exploitation of distinct ecological niche",
