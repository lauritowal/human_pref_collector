        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe PUPILTRAITS project seeks to advance our understanding of individual differences in visual perception, a critical yet underexplored area in vision science. Despite detailed knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of visual processing, the reasons for variability in perceptual styles—such as why some individuals perceive the whole before the parts while others focus on local details—remain unclear. This project aims to bridge this gap by integrating innovative methodologies, including pupil responses, ultra-high field MRI of the visual cortex, and psychophysical techniques. Leveraging robust pilot data, we hypothesize that individual differences in visual processing are closely linked to personality traits, providing novel biomarkers for perceptual styles associated with autistic traits, even in young children. Additionally, we will investigate how metabolic states, such as ketosis, can modulate early visual processing and perceptual styles. By demonstrating that changes in metabolism can influence visual perception, this research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of developmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The project's findings could lead to more objective diagnostic tools and innovative therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the role of general physiology in shaping perception and behavior. This work promises to contribute valuable insights into the complex interplay between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception, with broad implications for both scientific and societal domains."

We know in detail the fundamental steps leading to visual perception, but we do not know why normally sighted people differ in how they perceive: why some “see the forest before the trees”, while others have a fragmented perceptual experience focused on local features. PUPILTRAITS aims to fill this gap by taking an innovative approach to vision science, to understand how vision is affected by physiological state and personality traits. I will measure visual processing with both classic and new methods (that I helped develop), including pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance of human visual cortex, and psychophysics. Based on solid pilot data, I predict that differences in behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits, providing new reliable biomarkers of the local context-independent perception associated with autistics traits, even in young children (using pupillometry). These tools will also reveal changes of perception within individuals: during a safe and simple physiological intervention (ketosis, a metabolic state that can be naturally induced by fasting and intense physical activity), to show that early visual processing can be altered by acting on metabolism, and that this consequently affects holistic/local perceptual styles. My aim is to provide new knowledge on the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing and perception. This has the potential for a strong societal impact: it can change our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, like Autistic Spectrum Disorders, characterized by a different way of processing incoming information; it can aid their diagnosis through objective evaluation of perceptual styles, and encourage innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at changing perception and behavior by acting on general physiology: how we eat and exercise",
