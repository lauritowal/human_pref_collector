        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Law without Mercy\" seeks to explore the role of military justice in the implementation and legitimization of Japanese aggression during the Asia-Pacific War (1937-1945). This research will delve into the practices of Japanese military courts and courts-martial, examining how these judicial mechanisms functioned to regulate and channel violence, coerce civilian populations, and project the legitimacy of Japan's war efforts both domestically and internationally. Despite the formal legal framework, the outcomes of these trials often resulted in severe punishments, including execution and long-term imprisonment, reflecting the broader brutality of the conflict. The study will fill a significant gap in historical scholarship by providing a systematic analysis of the intersection between law and violence during this period. Through original archival research, the project will uncover new sources and insights, contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that facilitated and rationalized mass violence. By situating this study at the nexus of modern Japanese history and international law, \"Law without Mercy\" aims to offer practical historical lessons that are relevant to contemporary issues of conflict and humanitarian law."

Wherever Japanese soldiers went, judge-advocates followed, meeting out stern justice to soldiers, civilians and enemy soldiers alike. The system of courts-martial and military courts throughout East and Southeast Asia served three purposes: regulate violence and channel it efficiently to serve Japan's war goals; deter the civilian population and coerce it into following Japan's 'New Order' in East Asia; and finally, convince domestic and international audiences that Japan's war was not only legitimate, but also 'legal'. Yet, despite formal pretences, verdicts routinely ended in execution or harsh imprisonment. As such, the violence of the justice system mirrored the brutality of the war in general. Despite the highly contentious nature of the war even today, a systematic study of mass violence during the Asia-Pacific War has been sorely lacking. 'Law without Mercy' undertakes this daunting task by using military justice as focal point and as a highly precise lens for studying the various figurations of violence during the war. It is pioneering in analysing legal practice as an integral part of this violence and facilitator for its routinisation and escalation on the battlefield and in the occupied territories. And finally, it opens up a wholly new and large body of sources through original archival work that helps to overcome the notorious direness of documentation on Japan's conduct during the war. Situated at the intersection of several historical fields, 'Law without Mercy' capitalises on the double expertise of the PI in modern Japanese history and international law. With the complex and precarious relation between law, war and violence still at the heart of humanitarian issues, the historical insights of this project have very practical implications for our conflict-laden world today.",
