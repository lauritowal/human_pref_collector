        "This project seeks to bridge the gap between natural language semantics and the study of semantic paradoxes, particularly those involving self-applicable truth. Despite the apparent relevance of paradoxes like the Liar to natural language, semanticists have largely overlooked these issues, focusing instead on assigning truth conditions to sentences in a way that aligns with intuitive linguistic practices. Philosophical logicians, on the other hand, have explored various solutions to paradoxes, often at the expense of natural language desiderata. This project aims to develop a unified framework that integrates these two perspectives. The first component, \"Truth in Semantics,\" will develop semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, incorporating modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals alongside the concept of truth. The second component, \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics,\" will examine the foundational role of truth in natural language semantics, specifically how it can be integrated into a truth-conditional framework. By addressing these challenges, the project will provide a systematic and comprehensive study of truth and natural language semantics, offering new insights into the nature of linguistic meaning and the paradoxes that challenge it."

Does Anne believe that Bob's assumption is false?\" Don't try too hard answering the question - any straightforward attempt will lead to paradox. But what are we to make of sentences such as \"Anne believes that Bob's assumption is false.\" Is the sentence true or false? On the face of it, it would seem that answering this question is a pressing problem for natural language semantics that assigns truth conditions to sentences of natural language. However, semanticists have largely ignored problems of this kind, leaving the field to philosophical logicians working on paradoxes, in particular, the paradoxes of truth such as the Liar paradox. But research on the paradoxes of truth has often focused on exploring the space of possible coherent \"solutions\" to the paradoxes thereby ignoring desiderata of natural language semantics. The project provides a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics, and the research on the so-called semantic paradoxes in form of theories of self-applicable truth. A unified approach to truth and semantics will need to answer two principal challenges, which divides the research project into two interrelated parts. The first part, Truth in Semantics, aims at developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, that is, fragments in which, besides the notion of truth, we allow for, e.g., modal expressions, propositional attitudes but also natural language conditionals. The second part, Truth and the Foundations of Semantics, assumes a metasemantic perspective and explores the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics. The project constitutes the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from such a combined perspective.",
