        "The urgent need to shift human diets towards healthier and more sustainable options is a critical global challenge. However, altering entrenched food preferences, particularly those rooted in familiar flavors, poses a significant obstacle. The process of odor-taste associative learning plays a crucial role in the formation and retrieval of flavor preferences, yet the underlying cortical mechanisms that enable this transfer of appetitive properties from the mouth to environmental objects remain largely unexplored. The OLFLINK project aims to address this gap by investigating the neural processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth across three interconnected levels of inquiry. First, we will identify the neural code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (WP1). Second, we will explore the cortical control mechanisms that enable the encoding and retrieval of these associations in varying contexts (WP2). Finally, we will examine how digestive feedback influences the flexible coding system during the acquisition and retrieval of flavor preferences (WP3). This research will provide critical insights into how the body adjusts learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, potentially transforming our understanding of maladaptive eating patterns. The findings from OLFLINK will bridge the current knowledge gap between the perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the external environment, paving the way for innovative interventions to support dietary changes throughout life."

Odor-taste associative learning is the principal perceptual support process for flavor preference formation and retrieval. Mechanistic insight into the cortical processes that transfer appetitive properties of an odor from the mouth onto environmental objects is, however, almost completely absent. As a result, fundamental questions about the processes that drive the acquisition of new flavor preferences, and their regulation by signals from the digestive tract, still remain to be answered. OLFLINK will uncover processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth across three nested levels of investigation that are usually studied in separation. In doing so, I propose to discover key factors that facilitate or hinder acquisition of new flavor preferences. Specifically, I will 1: determine the distributed CODE by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (WP1), 2: delineate the cortical CONTROL mechanisms that facilitate encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations in the light of contextual variability (WP2), and 3: determine the interactions with digestive feedback that REGULATE this flexible coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (WP3). This final step especially provides insight into the bodyâ€™s ability to adjust learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and has potential to transform our thinking about the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. The novel insights from OLFLINK will fill the knowledge gap that currently exists between the mechanisms driving perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the outside world, and will inspire the development of novel interventions to facilitate dietary changes over the life course.",
