        "**Abstract:**\n\nF-AI-MILY is a pioneering interdisciplinary project that aims to explore the complex interplay between family dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) in the home environment. By integrating methodologies from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction, this project seeks to understand how the presence of artificial agents influences family relationships and well-being. Specifically, F-AI-MILY will develop and deploy a novel group-centred mobile lab to study the neurocognitive aspects of family social dynamics, focusing on the mechanisms of similarity and distance between family members. This mobile lab will enable the collection of both behavioral and neural data, providing a comprehensive and detailed understanding of how artificial agents impact family interactions.\n\nThe project will also investigate the developmental aspects of these dynamics, particularly how long-term interactions with artificial agents affect families with children aged 4-12 years. By examining the influence of these agents on child development and family flexibility, F-AI-MILY aims to uncover the nuanced ways in which AI can shape social behaviors and attitudes over time.\n\nFurthermore, F-AI-MILY will explore the potential of artificial agents to support families coping with chronic illness. Using the insights gained from the mobile lab, the project will develop an AI support system designed to foster adaptive social dynamics and enhance family resilience. This innovative approach not only advances our understanding of family systems and neurocognition but also paves the way for the development of more effective and supportive AI technologies."

With families increasingly inviting artificial agents into their life, questions arise how we can describe these dynamics in the age of artificial intelligence. Integrating insights and methods from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-ai interaction, F-AI-MILY will 1) establish a new group-centred mobile-lab approach to study the neurocognition of family social dynamics, 2) describe the developmental aspects of changes in households’ social dynamic during long-term interactions with artificial agents, and 3) identify how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can provide support in households with chronic illness. First, we will develop a new group-centred mobile lab to study how the key mechanisms of social dynamics, similarity and distance between family members, are impacted by interactions with artificial agents. Using this innovative neurocognition-at-home approach we will measure both behavioural and brain measures of key attitudes and behaviours of all family members and uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity. Second, we will test how child development interacts with the impact of artificial agents on social dynamics. Going beyond one-off interactions, we will directly test how long-term living with an artificial agent affects families with children (4-12 years) that differ in their flexibility to the influence of these agent. Third, we will use the neurocognition-at-home approach to guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households. This artificial agent support system targets family coping with chronic illness and aims to change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics. The innovative, interdisciplinary, and full circle approach of F-AI-MILY offers new ground-breaking vistas on family systems, neurocognition of social behaviour, and the developmental of artificial agents.",
