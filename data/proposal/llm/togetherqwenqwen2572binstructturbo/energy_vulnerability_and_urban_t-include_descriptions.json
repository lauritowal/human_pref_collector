        "This project aims to address the pressing issue of energy poverty in urban areas of Eastern and Central Europe (ECE), where millions of households struggle to afford adequate heating due to rising energy costs, inefficient housing, and decaying infrastructure. Despite some academic and policy attention, the current understanding of energy poverty in these regions is limited, focusing primarily on income and energy efficiency. Our project seeks to broaden this perspective by conducting the first comprehensive examination of the multidimensional aspects of energy vulnerability in post-socialist cities. Utilizing an energy vulnerability framework, we will explore how institutional structures, urban design, and daily practices contribute to the prevalence and impacts of domestic energy deprivation. Through a mixed-methods approach, the project will conduct a comparative analysis of eight urban districts across Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary), and Skopje (North Macedonia). The findings will provide critical insights into the social and spatial dynamics of energy poverty, informing the development of more effective and equitable strategies for improving energy access and sustainability in transitioning urban environments. This research has the potential to enhance existing policies and create new frameworks for delivering affordable, clean, and efficient energy services, thereby supporting climate change mitigation efforts."

The limited body of scholarship and policy tends to conceptualize domestic energy deprivation in ECE through the narrow lens of incomes and energy efficiency. The purpose of this project is to radically transform the state of the art in the field by undertaking the first comprehensive investigation of the multiple social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the grain of the post-socialist city. The project will use an energy vulnerability framework to explore the causes, character and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE. Energy vulnerability can be seen as the propensity of a household to experience a lack of socially- and materially-necessitated energy services in the home. EvalUaTE will investigate the manner in which institutional structures, built tissues and everyday practices shape urban energy vulnerability. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will achieve its aims by undertaking a comparative study of eight urban districts within Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia). The knowledge gained from the project can potentially lead to the improvement of existing, or establishment of new, technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, ultimately aiding climate change mitigation.",
