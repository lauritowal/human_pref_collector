        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe POLYCHROME project will investigate the historical and cultural transformation of polychromed Christian images in the Nordic countries, focusing on wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces that have survived since the Reformation. This study aims to understand how these once-vital objects of devotion have evolved into significant cultural heritage and to assess their current vulnerability. The project will explore the fluctuating values attached to these Catholic devotional objects since the Reformation, marked by the pivotal actions of Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway in 1527 and 1537, respectively. Despite the scarcity of documentary evidence, POLYCHROME will employ advanced scientific technologies to analyze approximately 150 polychromed objects, many of which exhibit signs of partial mutilation. This analysis will provide new insights into whether the damages and losses can be attributed to iconoclastic acts, accidents, or inherent material weaknesses. The material data will also inform the mapping of restorations and repairs, contributing to a multidisciplinary understanding of the objects' heritage value. By challenging existing assumptions about the preservation of medieval devotional objects in the Lutheran context, POLYCHROME will influence future conservation practices and training, fostering a broader debate on the care and preservation of religious heritage in the Nordic region."

How have wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces transformed from potent objects of devotion to cultural heritage? To what extent is this category of cultural heritage at risk? Values attached to Catholic devotional objects have fluctuated dramatically since Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway declared a break with the church in Rome (1527 and 1537, respectively). However, documentary sources shed little light on changes in status, volatility, and repairs. POLYCHROME will take an ambitious leap that scholars concerned with polychromy in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been reluctant to make: to determine the extent to which losses of noses, eyes and limbs are tied to iconoclastic acts. To date, historians and most conservators have attributed damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism, but not to targeted violence. This is due in part to a lack of archival evidence, but also because secondary paints often mask critical information on surfaces and in internal structures. POLYCHROME will harness technologies from the natural sciences to create, from the ground up, the first analytical overview of c. 150 polychromed objects that are (or potentially were) partially mutilated. The material data will offer essential foundations for determining whether damages and losses can be linked to violence, accidents or inherent weakness. The data will guide the mapping of restorations and repairs, and will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates about heritage values and the future care of religious heritage in the Nordics. The outcomes will complicate conversations about the preserving effects of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects, and will influence training priorities for years to come.",
