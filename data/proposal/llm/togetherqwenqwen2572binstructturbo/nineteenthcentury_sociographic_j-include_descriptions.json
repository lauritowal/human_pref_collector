        "This project explores the pivotal role of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism in shaping the foundational frameworks of social knowledge and science. By examining a diverse corpus of social sketches, including travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures, from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America, the project aims to bridge the gap in discipline-oriented histories that have overlooked journalism as a critical form of knowledge. The study will employ an innovative blend of anthropological and historiographical methods to analyze the representational techniques of sociographic journalism, its influence on epistemic developments, and its integration into socio-spatial contexts. Additionally, the project will investigate the relationship between these journalistic works and broader processes such as urbanization, cultural transfer, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines. Key outcomes include a series of scholarly essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a collected volume, and two monographs, collectively contributing to a more inclusive and transdisciplinary understanding of the evolution of social knowledge."

It represents the first comprehensive study to investigate pieces of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as formative frames/catalysts of social knowledge and science. These social sketches (often referred to as panoramic literature) provide rich ethnographic micro-analysis and often relate to debates held by statisticians, moralists, folklorists, and ethnologists. However, in the discipline-oriented histories of the social sciences and humanities, journalism has been ignored as a form of knowledge and as a founding genre of modern (disciplinary, academic) social science. By exploring the epistemic significance of sociographic journalism, the project promises to institute a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational historiography of the evolution of social knowledge and to revise mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric tales of the past and present. The project has five kinds of outcome: a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. The corpus comprises social sketches and examples of related knowledge frames (travel accounts, philanthropic reports, caricatures etc.) from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The project develops an innovative mix of anthropological/historiographical approaches to examine (1) the representational techniques of sociographic journalism (e.g., methods of constructing social types, the influence of scientific paradigms); (2) how it connects with epistemic developments (e.g., towards materialist and historicizing conceptions of society); (3) its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects; and (4) how the journalistic sketches are to be situated against processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.",
