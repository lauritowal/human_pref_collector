        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying infant learning, focusing on statistical computations and symbolic competence. Building on the notion that infants are remarkably adept learners, we posit that human cerebral architecture and access to a rich symbolic system are key factors. The project is structured into six work packages, integrating non-invasive brain-imaging techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography. WP1 examines the emergence of statistical inferences in preterm infants through hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 investigates how different pre-term environments (in-utero vs. ex-utero) influence early statistical computations in both visual and auditory domains, and their impact on brain activity throughout the first year. WP3 delves into the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, highlighting the role of left perisylvian areas and their connectivity. WP4 explores infant symbolic competency by testing criteria such as generalization, bidirectionality, and the use of algebraic rules and logical operations in the first six months of life. WP5 and WP6 are cross-cutting, with WP5 using MRI to refine functional localization and maturational markers, and WP6 developing new tools for multimodal brain image analysis. This comprehensive approach seeks to uncover the unique neural architecture that enables human learning from the earliest stages of cortical development."

I propose here that two other elements are crucial. The first is the particular human cerebral architecture that constrains statistical computations. The second is the humanâ€™s ability to access a rich symbolic system. I have planned 6 work packages using the complementary information offered by non-invasive brain-imaging techniques (EEG, MRI and optical topography) to understand the neural bases of infant statistical computations and symbolic competence from 6 months of gestation up until the end of the first year of life. WP1 studies from which preterm age, statistical inferences can be demonstrated using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 investigates the consequences of a different pre-term environment (in-utero versus ex-utero) on the early statistical computations in the visual and auditory domains and their consequences on the ongoing brain activity along the first year of life. WP3 explores the neural bases of how infants infer word meaning and word category, and in particular the role of the left perisylvian areas and of their particular connectivity. WP4 questions infant symbolic competency. I propose several criteria (generalization, bidirectionality, use of algebraic rules and of logical operations) tested in successive experiments to clarify infant symbolic abilities during the first semester of life. WP5-6 are transversal to WP1-4: WP5 uses MRI to obtain accurate functional localization and maturational markers correlated with functional results. In WP6, we develop new tools to combine and analyse multimodal brain images. With this proposal, I hope to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture that are critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits.",
