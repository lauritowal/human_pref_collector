        "The global forced migration crisis, affecting over 68.5 million individuals by 2016, disproportionately impacts developing countries, which host 85% of the world's displaced population. Despite its scale, the economic implications of forced migration in these regions remain underexplored. The FORCEDMIGDEV project aims to address this gap by examining the dual dimensions of forced migration: internal displacement and international refugee flows. The first component of the project develops a structural model to analyze the long-term economic impacts of refugee inflows, focusing on the case of Syrian refugees in Turkey, the largest host country globally. This model will evaluate distributional and welfare effects, as well as the impact of legal status on refugees. The second component integrates reduced-form and structural methods to study the economic consequences of severe climate shocks on internal displacement, using Brazil as a case study. By leveraging unique data, the project will estimate the immediate and long-term effects of internal displacement on various economic outcomes, including labor markets and regional development. A novel spatial model will be developed to capture the equilibrium effects in both origin and destination regions, accounting for congestion, agglomeration, and labor market frictions. This research will provide critical insights into the economic dynamics of forced migration and open new avenues for policy and academic exploration at the intersection of climate and development economics."

This crisis is vastly concentrated in developing countries, which host 85% of the world’s displaced population. Nevertheless, we still know relatively about the economic consequences of forced migration in these countries. FORCEDMIGDEV seeks to fill this gap. It is organised in complementary parts that analyse the two dimensions of forced migration – internal displacement and international migration (refugees) – which constitute very different economic phenomena. The first part develops a structural model to analyse the long-run impacts of refugee inflows in developing countries. The model is estimated and used to investigate the effects of the Syrian refugees in Turkey, the largest host country in the world. I am able to answer questions that are relevant for developing but also developed host countries. What are the distributional effects of refugee shocks? What are the welfare effects across regions? What are the effects of providing refugees with a legal status? The second part combines reduced-form and structural methods to investigate the effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement and its impacts on economic development. I take advantage of unique data availability in Brazil to estimate the reduced-form effects of internal displacement on a broad array of outcomes at destination. I then move to develop a novel quantitative spatial model that captures the equilibrium effects in origin and destination regions, while accounting for congestion and agglomeration externalities and labour market frictions. I estimate the model and use it to assess the long-run, micro and macro effects of internal displacement in Brazil. This part lies on the under-explored intersection of climate and development economics, which has a large potential to open new avenues for future research,",
