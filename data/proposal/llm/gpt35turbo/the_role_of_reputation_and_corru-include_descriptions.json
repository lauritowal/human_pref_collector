        "This research proposal aims to investigate the impact of corruption and reputation in public procurement processes. The primary goal is to enhance social welfare by designing procedures that prevent waste and ensure contractor compliance. The proposal outlines three empirical projects to advance our understanding in this area. \n\nComponent 1 will focus on the use of reputation in contract procurement. By analyzing the effects of a vendor rating system, this project aims to determine whether such systems lead to performance improvements by contractors, the potential increase in procurement costs, and the impact on corruption and entry of new bidders.\n\nComponent 2 will delve into corruption in public procurement. By examining networks of firms engaged in criminal activities, this project seeks to understand the extent of corruption, the effectiveness of different awarding rules in combating corruption, and the use of tests to detect corrupt practices.\n\nComponent 3 will specifically focus on healthcare procurement regulations. By analyzing procurement practices of medical devices in the EU, this project aims to assess the use of discretionary awarding rules in relation to corruption and contractor reputation, and evaluate the impact of these practices on patients' welfare.\n\nThrough these projects, this research proposal seeks to provide valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency and integrity of public procurement processes."

Thus, it is crucial that the procedures through which procurement occurs be designed to avoid waste and enhance social welfare. Preventing corruption and ensuring contractor compliance with their obligations constitute primary design goals. Nevertheless, very limited evidence exists as to how different awarding methods are susceptible to corruption, and how contractors’ past reputation should be used to award new tenders. This research proposal describes three empirical projects that will advance the frontier of our understanding of the roles of corruption and reputation in procurement. Component 1 focuses on the use of reputation in contract procurement. It analyzes the evidence produced by the introduction of a vendor rating system to: i) determine whether the new system induced contractors to improve their performance, ii) determine whether performance improvements caused higher procurement costs, and iii) evaluate concerns on corruption and entry of new bidders. Component 2 focuses on corruption in public procurement. It analyzes evidence on the presence of networks of firms engaged in criminal activities in public procurement to determine: i) the extent of the phenomenon, (ii) the functioning of different awarding rules against corruption, and iii) the use of tests to detect corruption. Component 3 focuses on healthcare procurement regulations. It analyzes evidence on the public procurement of medical devices to accomplish: i) a descriptive analysis of the procurement practices across the EU, ii) an assessment of whether discretionary awarding rules are used to foster corruption or to reward contractors with better reputation, and iii) an evaluation of these procurement practices in terms of patients’ welfare.",
