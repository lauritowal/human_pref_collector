        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the role of gamma waves in the visual cortex during active wakefulness. Gamma waves are crucial for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, and their dysfunction is linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Building on the predictive coding theory, which suggests that the brain generates top-down predictions to interpret sensory inputs, this study proposes a new hypothesis: gamma waves signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, rather than carrying prediction errors. By developing a novel method using deep-learning networks for prediction, the research aims to quantify predictions and prediction errors in the context of natural vision. Multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans will be conducted to investigate if predictability determines gamma waves and their synchronization pattern. Additionally, the study will explore the impact of experience and perceptual learning on gamma waves, and test the hypothesis that gamma waves drive perceptual learning and depend on top-down feedback. The findings of this research are expected to provide evidence for a new, unified theory about the role of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions."

These waves are believed to be essential for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Their impairment is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, it remains heavily debated what gamma waves encode, and what their precise role in information transmission is. I have recently proposed a new theory about gamma in visual cortex, building on the predictive coding theory. The predictive coding theory holds that the brain makes active top-down predictions about its own sensory inputs. By comparing these, it generates bottom-up prediction errors to drive learning and the updating of priors. The standard view in predictive coding theories is that gamma waves carry prediction errors. However, I recently hypothesized the opposite: 1) Gamma waves signal a match between predictions and sensory inputs (i.e. predictability), and 2) Columns that predict each other's visual input engage in long-range gamma-synchronization. To test this hypothesis, it is critical to develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in the context of natural vision. I will solve this by using recently developed deep-learning networks for prediction. By making multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans (MEG), I will test if predictability indeed determines gamma waves and their synchronization pattern across space. Because stimulus priors have to be acquired through learning, I will further determine whether gamma waves depend on experience and perceptual learning. In marmosets, I will develop an optogenetics approach to test whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning, and test the prediction that V1 gamma waves depend on top-down feedback. In sum, I expect to provide evidence for a new, unified theory about the role of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions.",
