        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the dynamic properties of conscious and unconscious mental processes through behavioral and brain imaging methods. The study will focus on three main tracks: \n\n1) Unconscious perception: Utilizing Gaze-Contingent Substitution, the project will explore the dynamic and constantly updated processing streams of unconscious visual information. This novel approach will allow for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli to uncover the nature of these dynamic unconscious streams.\n\n2) Conscious perception: By applying the Bayesian framework, the research will investigate how prior knowledge influences the construction of conscious percepts. Specifically, the project aims to understand how prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents and \"fills in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness.\n\n3) The maturation of consciousness: Using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, the study will examine the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants. The project will seek to determine whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information or anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control.\n\nOverall, this research project aims to provide new insights into the sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual illusions, and the development of consciousness in humans."

Most research on this topic has been limited to a static perspective, by studying static stimuli, by considering processing as a function of present information, and by focusing on a single, adult stage of development. Yet, both conscious and unconscious mental processes are intrinsically driven by dynamic properties. We will study these properties by relying on behavioral and brain imaging methods along three tracks: 1) Unconscious perception: Our visual system is, in real life, constantly receiving unconscious sequences of information that will generate dynamic and constantly updated processing streams. We will study these dynamic unconscious streams, thanks to Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel approach allowing for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. 2) Conscious perception: Construction of a conscious percept does not only depend on present stimulation but also on interactions with prior knowledge. Relying on the Bayesian framework, we will study the mechanisms by which prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents, by \"filling-in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness. 3) The maturation of consciousness: Using both psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, we will study the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants, and whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information, or rather anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control. The expected impact of the project will be 1) to evidence sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions 3) to provide new insights on the mystery of how consciousness develops in humans.",
