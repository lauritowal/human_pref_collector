        "The proposed project, \"Agents of Change: Reimagining the Role of Slaves in Antiquity\" (ACRSA), seeks to delve into the often overlooked aspect of slave agency in shaping ancient societies. Building upon existing scholarship, ACRSA aims to explore the multifaceted identities of enslaved individuals, the communities they formed, and the impact of their agency on political, social, economic, and cultural developments in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By examining a wide range of ancient sources in various languages, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Greek, and Latin, the project will provide a comprehensive understanding of ancient slavery beyond the boundaries of classical Greece and Roman Italy. \n\nLed by a diverse team of researchers, ACRSA will create a digital prosopography of ancient slaves, incorporating original sources and translations to facilitate further research in the field. The resulting Linked Open Data will enable innovative quantitative and qualitative analyses, contributing significantly to the field of Digital Humanities. Through the publication of a monograph, two collective volumes, articles, dissertations, workshops, an international conference, and a dedicated website, ACRSA aims to rewrite the narrative of antiquity with enslaved individuals at its core. This project represents a crucial step towards a more inclusive and holistic understanding of ancient history, shedding light on the agency and contributions of individuals who have long been marginalized in historical discourse."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",
