        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of increased access to social media on peace-building efforts and the perpetuation of violence in conflict-affected communities, with a specific focus on Africa, particularly Eastern Africa. As initiatives to extend Internet access to remote regions continue to grow, it is crucial to understand how social media is shaping conflict dynamics at the macro, meso, and micro levels. By exploring the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, the reactions of public authorities to social media, and the ways in which individuals engage with violent conflict online, this project aims to uncover key insights into the role of social media in promoting or hindering peace in conflict-affected regions. The research will delve into topics such as dangerous speech online, the movement of individuals in and out of conflict zones, and the strategies employed by various actors to influence online discourse. By shedding light on how governance actors are utilizing social media in conflict-affected communities, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working on peace-building efforts in Africa and beyond."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",
