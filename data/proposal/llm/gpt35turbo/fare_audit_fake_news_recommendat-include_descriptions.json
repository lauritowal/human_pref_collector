        "The rise of disinformation poses a significant threat to democracy and social cohesion globally. FARE_AUDIT aims to address this pressing issue by developing an innovative tool to audit search engines and analyze the impact of browsing history on search results. By understanding how algorithms filter and present information to users, particularly in relation to disinformation, this project seeks to shed light on the role of search engines in perpetuating information bubbles and reinforcing user biases. \n\nThrough the use of web-crawlers, FARE_AUDIT will provide a privacy-protecting system that can be utilized by democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify and monitor disinformation in real-time. By simulating alternative online profiles, the tool will also help breach information bubbles and promote a more diverse range of perspectives in search results. \n\nImportantly, FARE_AUDIT anticipates the transition from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting technology and aims to leverage this shift to enhance the scope and efficacy of the tool. By offering a comprehensive solution to combat disinformation spread through search engines, this project will contribute to increasing public awareness of the issue and empowering organizations to effectively monitor and address disinformation, particularly in political contexts."

Citizens increasingly rely on (dis)information available online, either somewhat passively, through social media feeds, or actively, by using search engines and specific websites. In both scenarios, algorithms filter and select displayed information according to the users’ past preferences. There is a real risk that algorithms might reinforce the user’s beliefs and create (dis)information bubbles, by offering less divergent views, or even directing them to low-credibility content. For these reasons, serious efforts have been made to identify and remove “fake-news” websites and minimize the spread of disinformation on social media, but we have not witnessed equivalent attempts to understand and curtail the role of search engines. FARE_AUDIT addresses this imbalance and offers an innovative tool to audit search engines that can be broadly used. It will help to 1) better understand how browsing history influences search engine results, particularly the likelihood of being directed to disinformation, 2) create a system that democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens can use to identify new disinformation, in near real-time, and 3) breach information bubbles by simulating how search results would be different if users had a different online profile. By relying on web-crawlers, our tool is privacy-protecting and does not require any real user data. Moreover, the proposed system anticipates the announced shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting and takes advantage of the expected small time overlap between both systems to learn from both and broaden its scope. Overall, we expect this novel tool to have a meaningful social impact by increasing public awareness of the role of search engines on disinformation spread, and by equipping organizations with a tool to detect and monitor disinformation, especially in political contexts.",
