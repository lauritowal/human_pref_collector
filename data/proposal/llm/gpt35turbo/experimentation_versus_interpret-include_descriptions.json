        "This research proposal seeks to explore the shifting landscape of musical performance practices in the context of a transition from text-based to performative-based renderings of musical works. The project aims to investigate the historical underpinnings of musical interpretation, the potential for new paths through experimental performance practices, and the applicability of the scientific model of experimentation to music performance. Through a focus on material engagement in artistic practice, the project will generate concrete artistic outputs to contribute to both theory and practice in music performance. By combining theoretical investigation with practical music-making, the project will push the boundaries of traditional understandings of musical interpretation and offer tangible alternatives. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, this project will not only advance the field of musical performance but also contribute to the broader discourse on Artistic Experimentation. Ultimately, this research proposal presents a compelling case for change in the field of musical performance by offering innovative approaches and tangible examples to challenge traditional norms and foster new possibilities."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 277 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nAs part of the historical shift out of a textual culture into a ‘mediatized’ image and sound culture, musical performance practices have undergone, in recent decades, a shift from text-based to performative-based renderings of musical works—focussing attention upon the experience of performance more as a material, present event, then as an ‘execution’ or ‘interpretation’ of an abstract work. The aim of this research proposal is to investigate: (a) the extent to which the traditional conception of musical interpretation is bound to a given historical period; (b) how new investigative paths can be created through experimental performance practices; and (c) the extent to which the scientific model of the practice of experimentation is transferable to music performance. Crucial to these objectives is the material engagement in artistic practice, including the generation of concrete artistic outputs by the PI and other team members. The practice of music – understood as a fundamental methodological tool for the generation and exposition of new knowledge, will contribute decisively to innovations in both theory and practice, opening up opportunities for both scholarship and future performance practices. While exploring alternative approaches to music performance, this project will deliver concrete examples of such possibilities, situating itself at the frontline of the burgeoning field of Artistic Research. Combining theoretical investigation with the concrete practice of music, this project presents a case for change in the field of musical performance. Alongside critical reflection on the state-of-the-art, it proposes a graspable and ‘audible’ alternative to traditional understandings of ‘interpretation’ in musical performance. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, it will benefit from, and contribute to, the wider discourse on Artistic Experimentation, the Centre's current research focus.",
