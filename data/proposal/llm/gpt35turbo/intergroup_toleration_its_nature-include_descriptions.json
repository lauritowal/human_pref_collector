        "This grant proposal aims to address the pressing question of how to live harmoniously and productively in increasingly diverse societies. Focusing on intergroup tolerance as a key aspect of coexisting with diversity, this research seeks to advance social psychological theorizing and empirical research in this area. By moving beyond intergroup stereotypes and discrimination, the study will investigate the psychological aspects of toleration, including objection, acceptance, rejection, and the consequences of being tolerated. Using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, this research will provide insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. The ultimate goal is to develop initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society, particularly in the context of cultural diversity. With the lack of systematic social psychological investigations in this area, this research is both groundbreaking and timely."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",
