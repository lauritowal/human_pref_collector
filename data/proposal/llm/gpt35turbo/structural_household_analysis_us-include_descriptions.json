        "This grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing household consumption behavior through structural models of individual preferences and within-household interactions. By treating households as collections of interacting individuals rather than single decision units, this project aims to unveil the complexities of consumption behavior that are often hidden within the \"intrahousehold black box.\" The proposed methodology will utilize nonparametric revealed preference techniques to extract preference information directly from observed consumption choices, without imposing unnecessary parametric assumptions on decision-making processes. \n\nAt a theoretical level, this project will incorporate marriage market dynamics into the modeling of household consumption, considering how outside options for household members impact consumption allocation through individual bargaining power. By integrating these dynamics, a more accurate representation of intrahousehold decision-making can be achieved, leading to a deeper understanding of household consumption patterns.\n\nFurthermore, at an empirical level, this project will combine revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems to enhance the applicability of these methods to diverse datasets. By addressing issues such as unobserved heterogeneity and limited power of revealed preference restrictions, this approach will provide a more robust analysis of household consumption behavior."

Understanding this consumption behavior requires non-unitary modeling of households, which recognizes that households are not single decision units but consist of interacting individuals. This project builds a powerful toolkit for empirical analysis of household consumption through structural models of individual preferences and within-household interactions. It opens the “intrahousehold black box” while only using the (limited) consumption information observed at the aggregate household level. In particular, I develop a revealed preference methodology that is intrinsically nonparametric. This method (only) uses preference information that is directly revealed by the observed consumption choices. It avoids confounding the analysis by imposing (nonverifiable) parametric/functional structure on within-household decision processes. My main contribution is twofold: 1. At the theoretical level, I integrate marriage market dynamics into the structural modeling of household consumption. The marriage market defines the “outside options” of (adult) household members, which indirectly impacts the intrahousehold consumption allocation (e.g. through individual bargaining positions). Modeling these marriage market effects implies a better description of the intrahousehold decision process, which in turn yields a more powerful analysis of household consumption. 2. At the empirical level, I integrate revealed preference restrictions on non-unitary household consumption with nonparametric estimation of demand systems (subject to non-unitary shape restrictions on household demand). This will enhance the applicability of revealed preference methods to widely available (pooled) cross-section data sets. It also allows for addressing empirical issues such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and limited power of revealed preference restrictions.",
