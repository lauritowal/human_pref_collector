        "The increasing frequency and severity of famines have become a global concern, with millions of individuals facing the devastating consequences of food insecurity. While existing scholarship has highlighted the political dimensions of famine, a comprehensive understanding of the everyday politics of famine at the community level is lacking. This grant proposal aims to address this research gap by conducting an ethnographically-informed comparative study in South Sudan and Somalia.\n\nBy focusing on the discourses and narratives surrounding famine within these communities, this groundbreaking research project seeks to uncover how new deadly famines become normalized, inhibiting political action and perpetuating blame on natural causes and affected families. The study will explore four key research strands, including the historical and cultural memories of past famines, the role of community narratives in reinforcing social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the impact of media and social media on anti-famine politics.\n\nLed by an experienced researcher with a diverse team of Somali and South Sudanese scholars, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of famine politics and inform future interventions to prevent and mitigate the impact of food crises. Through a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, this research will contribute to the development of strategies to address the root causes of famine and advocate for policies that prioritize the well-being of vulnerable populations."

For decades there has been a scholarly consensus that famine is the result of political failure or design, and never solely the result of natural disasters. However, a political culture that makes famine politically unconscionable and that ends famine has not emerged. To understand why famines persist we need to deepen our understanding of famine politics; so far scholarship on the politics of famine has focus on national and international institutions, and the instrumental use of famine by actors and institutions. My research will produce a ground-breaking shift in the science of famine politics by focusing on the everyday politics of famine in communities where it occurs. I am interested in how discourses and the ‘regime of truth’ about famine disperse throughout the social body (in Foucault’s words). In particular, I am interested in how new deadly famines come to be normalised, preventing political rupture. Plus, I am interested in how these discourses can shift blame for famine suffering away from governments, warring parties and actors in global economies, and instead place blame on natural causes and the families of those who suffer and die. To achieve this, I will conduct an ethnographically-informed comparative study across four sites in South Sudan and in Somalia. Initial ethnographic insights have made me structure the research around four cross-case-study research strands: histories and musical memories of past famine; community-narratives that enforce social networks; burial and posthumous practices; and media and social media’s role in anti-famine politics. This ambitious project is feasible because of my previous experience and networks, and because I have carefully built the capacity and track record of a team Somali and South Sudanese – dominated research team.",
