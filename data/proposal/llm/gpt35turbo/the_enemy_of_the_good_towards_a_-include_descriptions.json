        "This grant proposal seeks to support research on an alternative theory of moral progress that challenges the traditional notion of the \"expanding circle\" of moral concern. The current dominant account of moral progress suggests that moral recognition has gradually expanded to include individuals of all races, creeds, genders, and even non-human animals. However, this theory faces challenges due to the limitations of our evolved psychology, such as parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin. \n\nThis project aims to explore different forms of moral progress beyond the expanding circle model, focusing on moral attitudes that are not constrained by evolutionary factors. By investigating innovative approaches and institutions that can overcome these limitations, this research seeks to demonstrate that the potential for moral progress has been underestimated. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining philosophy, psychology, and sociology, this project will provide valuable insights into how we can achieve meaningful moral progress in contemporary society."

Full moral status was only accorded to people of a certain class, age, gender, ethnicity, or religion. Over time, the moral franchise was gradually extended, however imperfectly, to include human beings of all races, creeds, or genders. Eventually, even species membership is recognized as morally irrelevant, and the moral circle is extended towards non-human animals as well. Many influential ethicists call this the “expanding circle” of moral concern. Moral progress, on this account, consists in further expansions of the moral realm beyond ethically arbitrary features. This account, however, faces a serious feasibility problem: our moral concern is limited due to features of our evolved psychology. Empathy is parochial; altruism remains tied to friends and kin. This project will develop an alternative theory of moral progress. By focusing on different forms of moral progress other than the expanding circle, different moral attitudes which are not subject to the same evolutionary constraints, and smart institutions that can bypass the limits of our inherited psychology, it will be shown that the prospects of moral progress have been severely underestimated.",
