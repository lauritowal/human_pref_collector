        "The proposed project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in morality policy research through a comprehensive empirical and theoretical approach. MORAPOL aims to fill a significant gap in the field by providing systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies across 25 OECD countries over a thirty-year period. The project will focus on changing patterns in morality policies related to \"life and death,\" sexuality, and addictive substances and addictive behavior. \n\nIn addition to its innovative empirical focus, MORAPOL is also conceptually groundbreaking. The project aims to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields, rather than individual policies or items. This holistic approach will allow for the development of theories that account for changes in whole policy fields or subfields. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, MORAPOL will utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining macro-quantitative analysis with qualitative case studies. By systematically assessing the influence of international and domestic factors on morality policy change, the project will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of morality policy development. This research has the potential to significantly impact the field of policy analysis and contribute to a deeper understanding of morality policy changes."

First, MORAPOL takes an innovative empirical focus. It is the first to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies. This policy area is so far unexplored from a policy-analytical perspective. The focus is on changing patterns of morality policy over time, across countries and policy subfields. The project compares morality policies in 25 OECD countries over a period of thirty years (1980 \u0013 2010). It involves a comparison across different subfields of morality policy, including (1) policies on \"life and death\" (abortion, euthanasia), (2) sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality) and (3) addictive substances and addictive behaviour. Second, the project is conceptually innovative. The theoretical aim is to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields rather than for individual policies or policy items. This holistic approach constitutes a path-breaking departure from existing concepts. This way, it is for the first time possible to develop theories that account for changes in whole policy fields or subfields. To systematically assess the influence of international and domestic factors on morality policy change, MORAPOL adopts a mixed-methods approach. In a first step, a macro-quantitative analysis is undertaken, based on legislative output data for the subfields and countries under study. This analysis is in a second step complemented with qualitative case studies. The case studies are selected on the basis of the results of the quantitative study, which turn out to be “critical” cases; i.e. cases that are apparently incorrectly predicted by the theoretical model.",
