        "The RELEVEN project seeks to revolutionize the curation and utilization of digital historical data to better serve the needs of historians. By reframing historical data as assertions linked to specific authorities, this innovative methodology allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexity and ambiguity inherent in historical narratives. The project focuses on the challenging yet crucial period of the late 11th century, with a trans-regional approach that highlights the interconnectedness of various regions within Christendom. By contextualizing and reusing existing online data, the project aims to prevent valuable resources from being underutilized. Drawing upon a wide range of digital resources and scholarly expertise in fields such as prosopography, textual scholarship, and archaeology, the project will provide a multi-faceted view of historical events that moves beyond regional perspectives to encompass a broader trans-regional context. Through the meticulous tracing of assertions to their authoritative sources, the project will shed light on the intricate web of connections and interactions that shaped the medieval world. Ultimately, the RELEVEN project will not only enhance our understanding of the past but also pave the way for a more sophisticated and comprehensive approach to historical research."

The approach is to re-frame both existing and new historical data as assertions, often sourced but always linked to an authority; this allows data to be manipulated according to source and authority, and also allows assertions themselves to be linked depending on whether they corroborate, depend on, or conflict with each other. The novel aspect of this methodology is that it takes to its logical conclusion something that historians all readily acknowledge and that is especially apparent for pre-modern history: that there are very few, if any, simple and undisputed facts. A related challenge is the contextualisation and reuse of existing online data for the period, to avoid its going to waste. The approach is tested by taking a broad trans-regional approach to the history of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), centred broadly in the eastern half of Christendom but incorporating developments elsewhere, especially in the newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The looming weight of the First Crusade at the century's end means that while certain regional or proto-national narratives—particularly for western Europe—are well-developed, they tend to obscure the larger trans-regional trends of communication and contact, particularly in eastern Christendom. By drawing upon the depth of scholarship and the plethora of digital resources that have emerged for this period in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, and by framing this scholarship in terms of assertions whose authority is traceable, it will become possible to look at the history not just from \"the eastern perspective\", but from several.",
