        "This research proposal aims to investigate the origins of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties through an analysis of the colonial conquest of Latin America. Utilizing the initial years of Spanish colonization as a natural experiment, this study seeks to address the challenges of disentangling the effects of legal origin from other factors such as human capital. By focusing on the early years of colonization when conquerors had limited knowledge of the land they intended to conquer, this research project offers a unique methodological approach. The use of contracts and other historical documents from the Archivo de Indias provides rich details on the rules that governed early institutions, offering a subnational perspective on the development of state capacity and political dynamics. By examining the unique context of the Spanish colonization of Latin America, this study avoids the traditional problems of diversity in legal origins and offers a nuanced understanding of the impact of initial institutions on long-term political outcomes. Through a careful analysis of historical documents and settlement patterns, this research project aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on the relationship between colonial legacies and contemporary political structures."

Much of the recent work on comparative politics and development uses large historical events as fruitful experimentation laboratories. However, the colonial experience looks more similar to a \"bundle treatment\" than a single treatment. It is difficult to disentangle the role of differences in legal origin from the influences of human capital, etc. To try to overcome this problem, past empirical approaches use a variety of methods like case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables. I will try to move one step further in this debate by considering the initial years of the Spanish colonization of Latin America as a natural experiment. My methodological approach has four advantages. First, since I only analyse the initial years of colonization, my empirical strategy is based on the fact that the initial conquerors had no knowledge of the land that they intended to conquer. The second advantage is that, in working with the colonization of Latin America, we only have one colonial power, Spain, which avoids the traditional problems of diversity of legal origins. The third advantage is that the contracts (“Capitulaciones”), that the conquerors signed with the King before embarking to America, and before even knowing anything about the land that he would conquer, and other documents from the Archivo de Indias, provide very rich details on the rules that governed the early institutions (power to tax and rule, the use of military power, the treatment of indigenous groups, etc.). Finally, these documents contain information to locate the initial settlements at the subnational level. The colonization of the Americas and the information contained in the “Capitulaciones” found in the Archivo de Indias provides a unique opportunity to advance the debate on these crucial questions.",
