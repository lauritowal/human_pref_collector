        "This project seeks to explore a new perspective on modernization by examining the translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages during the early modern period. While traditional scholarship often portrays modernity as a radical break with tradition, this project argues that modernization was a gradual process facilitated by Jewish translators who actively shaped and transformed the texts they were translating. By analyzing the rich corpus of early modern Jewish translations, this project aims to uncover a hitherto unexplored terrain of intercultural encounters between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. By highlighting the role of translation as a primary mechanism of cultural transfer in early modern Europe, this project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange. Through a comprehensive study of these translations, this project will demonstrate how Jewish translators were not passive recipients of non-Jewish sources, but rather active agents who deliberately and inadvertently mistranslated, added, and omitted content to align with their unique agendas. Ultimately, this project aims to shed light on the collaborative and innovative nature of the early modern \"Jewish book,\" offering a new paradigm for understanding the complex dynamics of cultural exchange in this transformative period."

This massive upheaval is said to have shaken the very foundations of every culture it frequented, subsequently eliminating the world which once was, to make way for a new age. This project offers a new understanding of modernization, not as a radical break with tradition, but as the careful importation of new ideas by often timid, almost inadvertent innovators. The project focuses on the rich corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which developed during the early modern period. Largely neglected by modern scholars, these translations played a pivotal role in fashioning Jewish culture from the sixteenth century into modern times. Jewish translators were never merely passive recipients of their non-Jewish sources; they mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, and harnessed their sources to meet their own unique agendas. Throughout the process of translation then, a new corpus was created, one that was distinctly Jewish in character, but closely corresponded with the surrounding majority culture. JEWTACT offers the first comprehensive study of the entire gamut of these early modern Jewish translations, exposing a hitherto unexplored terrain of surprising intercultural encounters which took place upon the advent of modernity—between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. The project posits translation as the primary and most ubiquitous mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer in early modern Europe. In so doing, I wish to revolutionize our understanding of the so-called early modern “Jewish book,” revealing its intensely porous, collaborative and innovative nature, and to offer a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange.",
