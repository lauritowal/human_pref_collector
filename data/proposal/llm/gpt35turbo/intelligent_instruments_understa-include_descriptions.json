    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the transformative impact of creative artificial intelligence (AI) on our relationships with technology and society through the lens of music. By developing instruments with creative AI capabilities, investigating human-AI collaboration in music, and exploring sonic instruments as scientific tools, this project aims to foster public understanding of AI and its implications. Through an interdisciplinary approach that brings together experts from various fields, the research will delve into how adopting intelligent instruments affects our notions of self, others, and knowledge. The project will also address the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and examine the implications of artificial intelligence in future society. Led by a renowned authority in new instruments and music software development, the research program will contribute to diverse disciplines by establishing a theoretical framework for creative AI, sparking conversations about human-centered AI, and promoting ethical AI design principles. This pioneering endeavor promises to advance our understanding of the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent technologies, paving the way for a more informed and responsible integration of AI in our lives."

But what does this mean? How does creative AI change our notions of art, culture and society? As new machine learning technologies begin to mirror ourselves, we need to look into that mirror and ask how this is changing us. This project takes a pioneering leap in research about AI by answering how new creative AI transforms our relationships with technology and other people. This ambitious vision is achieved by using music as a platform to establish public understanding of AI. Three respective work packages will develop: 1) instruments with creative AI; 2) human-AI collaboration in music; and 3) sonic instruments as scientific instruments. The project initiates a public discourse on creative AI and develops a theoretical framework describing the transformed notions of self, others and knowledge when we adopt intelligent instruments in our work. INTENT is interdisciplinary in nature. Applying the methodology of our new research collaboration protocol, we summon researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct frontier science on intelligent instruments as boundary objects. Through open science methods the outcomes will address: a) the role of creative AI in embodied technologies, and b) the understanding and reflection of artificial intelligence in future society. The PI is an established authority on new instruments and music software development. His interdisciplinary background in music, philosophy and computer science and AI, together with impactful academic leadership roles make him uniquely placed to lead this radical research programme. Grounded equally in technology development and the humanities, the project will benefit diverse disciplines by developing a theoretical framework of creative AI, initiating a discourse around human-centred creative AI, and defining principles of ethical AI design in services and products.",
