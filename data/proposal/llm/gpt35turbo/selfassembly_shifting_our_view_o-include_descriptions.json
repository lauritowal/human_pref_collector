    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, AssemblingLife, seeks to challenge the traditional view of life as requiring constant energy input and detailed genetic regulation by exploring the concept of self-assembly in living systems. By investigating self-assembly processes, which occur spontaneously and without external intervention, this interdisciplinary project aims to develop a new theoretical framework within the philosophy of science for understanding and explaining life. Specifically, the project will focus on redefining genetic causation as genes acting as \"nudgers\" of self-assembly processes rather than direct regulators, leading to a shift in the current understanding of living systems. \n\nDrawing on recent advancements in nanoscience research that utilize self-assembly processes in material development and technology, AssemblingLife will contribute novel theory and conceptual tools to both the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences. By exploring how self-assembly processes differ from classical mechanisms or intervention targets, the project will provide a new perspective on scientific explanation in the context of living systems. Through this innovative approach, AssemblingLife aims to challenge existing assumptions about the nature of life and offer a fresh understanding of genetic influence in biological processes."

Living beings are mainly viewed as systems requiring the constant input of energy and the detailed regulation by genetic material. These ideas of life very much influence the general understanding of living systems, and, particularly interesting for this project, it influences current philosophy of science accounts of the understanding and explanation of living processes. But what if life is much less “hard work” than often presented? And what if genes should be understood as “nudgers” rather than as “directing” living processes? Self-assembly is the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structure. It can be visualized as a pile of lego bricks turning into a Ninjago fortress on its own. There are no lego-builders. The parts “self-assemble”, possibly as a result of chemical and physical processes working between and on the parts. Recent nanoscience research efforts at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and material science, increasingly utilize self-assembly processes in the development of new materials, technologies and understanding of living systems. AssemblingLife will, on an interdisciplinary basis, build a new theoretical framework withing the philosophy of science for understanding and explaining life, building on the increasing focus and knowledge about self-assembly processes that carry the potential to shift our view of life. The project will provide a new understanding of genetic causation starting from the idea of genes as “nudging” self-assembly processes rather than as providing detailed regulation, and it will develop new theory of scientific explanation that will account for the observation that self-assembly processes do not behave like classical mechanisms or interventions targets. AssemblingLife plan for contributing novel and needed theory and conceptual tools both to the philosophy of science and to the empirical life sciences.",
