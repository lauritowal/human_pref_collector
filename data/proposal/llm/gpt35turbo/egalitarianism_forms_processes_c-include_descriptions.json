        "This grant proposal seeks to fund a project focused on investigating the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values. The project will consist of a library-based global comparative study as well as field ethnographic studies in various sites of egalitarian/inegalitarian crisis within Europe and other regions. These two components, the library and field studies, will be closely integrated, with each informing and shaping the other. The project aims to decenter traditional perspectives on egalitarianism by emphasizing the cultural phenomena and complexities of egalitarian practices and processes. By exploring egalitarianism as a cultural value, the project seeks to understand the force, contradictions, and limitations of these practices.\n\nThe key proposition of this project is to challenge the dualistic view of egalitarianism, particularly as it pertains to Euro-American forms. By focusing on the heterogeneity of egalitarianism and developing a comparative method suitable for this complexity, the project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of egalitarian processes, their constraints, limitations, and potential. The method developed will be open to the diverse conceptions and contexts under which egalitarian practices emerge, including historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological factors. Through this comparative approach, the project will shed light on perennial questions surrounding the role of the state, religion, economic distribution, and scale in structures with egalitarian effects."

This heterogeneity is approached through a) a library-based global comparative study and through b) field ethnographic studies, also comparatively oriented, in sites of egalitarian/inegalitarian crisis within Europe and elsewhere. The library and field studies are to be closely integrated, each influencing the development and directions of the other. The decentering inherent in the orientation heterogeneity involves an emphasis on the forms and practices of egalitarianism as cultural phenomena emergent within and having their complexities of effect through the socio-cultural dimensions of their realities. The key proposition of the project is that it is egalitarian practices and processes as cultural values that is of considerable importance for understanding their force, contradictions, limitations. Thus in this approach dualism that is widely conceived as being politically and philosophically problematic in egalitarianism as a whole is approached as a cultural phenomenon potentially specific to Euro-American forms. The emphasis on the heterogeneity of egalitarianism combined with the development of a comparative method appropriate to the heterogeneity of egalitarian processes, constitutes the distinction and the several contributions of the project to a fuller understanding of egalitarian processes, their constraints, limitations and potential. The method to be developed is to be open both to the varieties in the conceptions and imagination of egalitarian processes and the various historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances under which egalitarian practices emerge. Through the comparison perennial questions – the role of the state, religion, forms of economic distribution, the matter of scale – concerning forms and structures with egalitarian effect will be exposed to further consideration.",
