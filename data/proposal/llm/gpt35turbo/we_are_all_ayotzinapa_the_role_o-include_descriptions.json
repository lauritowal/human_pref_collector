        "This grant proposal seeks funding to explore the role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, focusing on the case of the 43 students who disappeared in Mexico in September 2014. The project aims to conduct a groundbreaking investigation by taking a dual approach. Firstly, it will explore the theoretical implications of disappearance as a unique crime that transforms the ontological status of the disappeared individuals, blurring traditional boundaries between life and death, past and present, materiality and immateriality. Secondly, the project will adopt a multidisciplinary perspective, placing the Mexican case within a broader transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World, including Argentina and Spain. By comparing the development of digital memory in Mexico with social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, the project will contribute to a redefinition of the relationship between media and memory. The ultimate goal of this research is to construct a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects within the context of networked social movements with a transnational reach. Through this innovative approach, the project aims to shed light on the transformative power of digital media in shaping collective memories of disappearance on a global scale."

It investigates a novel case that is in process of shaping: the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. The role of the new media in getting citizens’ attention and in marking a “turning point” was crucial to the upsurge of a counter-movement against the Mexican government and qualifies the event as significant for the transnational arena. The groundbreaking aspect of the project consists in proposing a double approach: a) a theoretical approach in which “disappearance” is considered as a particular crime that becomes a model for analyzing digital memory. Disappearance is a technology that produces a subject with a new ontological status: the disappeared are non-beings, because they are neither alive nor dead. This ontological status transgresses the clear boundaries separating life and death, past, present and future, materiality and immateriality, personal and collective spheres. “Digital memory”, i.e. a memory mediated by digital technology, is also determined by the transgression of the boundaries of given categories b) a multidisciplinary approach situating Mexico´s case in a long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World, including Argentina and Spain. This longer history seeks to compare disappearance as a mnemonic object developed in the global sphere –in social network sites as blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube– in Mexico and the social performances and artistic representations –literature, photo exhibitions, and films– developed in Spain and Argentina. The Mexican case represents a paradigm for the redefinition of the relationship between media and memory. The main output of the project will consist in constructing a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects in the rise of networked social movements with a transnational scope.",
