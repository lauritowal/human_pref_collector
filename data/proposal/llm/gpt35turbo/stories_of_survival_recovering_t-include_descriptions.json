        "This grant proposal seeks to support a ground-breaking project that aims to uncover the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Building on the migration patterns of Christians from the Ottoman Empire from the sixteenth century onwards, this project will bring together disparate sources from Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas to create a comprehensive archive of literary, documentary, and printed materials. Led by a team of researchers under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, this project will delve into archives in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of repositories to shed light on the lives and experiences of Eastern Christians during this period. \n\nThrough a robust strategy for dissemination, this project will bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, addressing the challenge of connecting micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history. By preserving philology and source criticism at the core of its methodology, this project will advance a rigorous form of global history. The outcomes of this project will include print publications, workshops, and a searchable database of writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750. This project represents a significant intervention in the field of global history, offering new insights into the experiences of Eastern Christians in the early modern world and contributing to a more nuanced understanding of global migration patterns."

Too often, however, this global migration has been seen purely as a modern development, one arising from contemporary political and confessional events in the Middle East, while in fact this phenomenon had its roots in the early modern period. From the sixteenth century onwards, Christians from the Ottoman Empire set out for distant worlds and foreign lands, travelling as far as Europe, India, Russia, and even the Americas and leaving traces of themselves across countless European and Middle Eastern archives, chanceries, and libraries. This transnational, ground-breaking project will gather all of these disparate sources into a single analytical frame to uncover, for the first time, the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Through the work of a team of researchers under the close supervision of the PI, the project will reconstitute and analyse a ‘lost archive’ of literary, documentary, and printed sources in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of archives. Under the expert leadership of the PI, the project will include a robust strategy for dissemination, which will successfully bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history. In doing so, this project will respond directly to one of the most pressing conceptual challenges facing global history today, that is, how to link the study of the micro-scale level of everyday life to the macro-narratives emphasised by global historians. Underlying this project, therefore, is a major intervention that seeks to advance a rigorous form of global history, and one which preserves philology and source criticism at the heart of its methodology. The outcomes of the project will include print-publications, workshops, and a searchable database of all writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750.",
