        "This grant proposal aims to explore the impact of history on conflict and economic development by utilizing two historical lenses. Building upon the framework of new institutional economics, the study will investigate the interplay between institutions and human capital in shaping economic outcomes. The research will focus on the first colonizers of Latin America, utilizing administrative data on their personal characteristics from 1492 to 1599. Through within-country analysis, the project will examine how differences in the institutional set-ups during the initial colonization period contributed to economic development and conflict in different regions of Latin America. By exploring the interaction between human capital and institutions in the early stages of colonization, the study aims to shed light on the sources of institutional persistence.\n\nFurthermore, the research will delve into the long-term impact of ancient conflicts on current conflict dynamics. By constructing a dataset of old conflicts based on archaeological evidence, the study will investigate how historical conflicts have influenced contemporary patterns of conflict by region over time. Through this multi-faceted approach, the project seeks to deepen our understanding of the role of history in shaping economic development and conflict, offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers alike."

Following the lead of the new institutional economics, part of the literature argues that institutions cause differences in productivity and factor endowments which, in turn, explain economic development. An alternative view assumes that human capital shapes institutional changes and, therefore, institutions are endogenous. In the first part of the project, which is the core of the research proposal, I will try to move one step further in this debate by taking an approach that uses administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The data contain some personal characteristics on each of the settlers from 1492 to 1599 (town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, city of arrival in the Americas, etc). Using within-country analysis, since we have information on the precise destinations of the first “pobladores” (settlers), and the different institutional set-ups during the first years of colonization for different geographical areas in Latin America, I will reexamine the issue of institutions versus human capital in the explanation of economic development and conflict. The institutions in the initial times of colonization were not the same in all the regions of Latin America and, in many cases, represented an evolution of pre-Colombian institutions. The new data allows also the analysis of the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial times. In addition the migrations and the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization provide also some guidance for the research on the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part I plan to go further back in time to understand how very old conflicts influence current conflict. I will construct a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the dynamics of conflict by regions in the very long run.",
