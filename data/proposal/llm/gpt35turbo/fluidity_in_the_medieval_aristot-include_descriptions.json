        "The proposed project, titled FitMA, seeks to address a significant gap in our understanding of the medieval reception of Aristotle's works by investigating the textual variance present in Latin translations from the 12th and 13th centuries. These translations played a crucial role in shaping the understanding of Aristotle's thought in the late medieval and early modern periods, yet the modifications and notes in the manuscripts have not been thoroughly examined. By producing state-of-the-art critical editions of three key treatises on natural philosophy - De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo - FitMA aims to uncover the ways in which readers were exposed to the translations, which differ significantly from the original Greek texts.\n\nThrough a detailed analysis of the textual fluidity in the manuscripts, FitMA will shed light on the diverse interpretations and perspectives that characterized the medieval reception of Aristotle. This innovative approach will not only enhance our understanding of the Latin translations themselves but also contribute to a broader model of interpretation applicable to other medieval translations of philosophy and science. By focusing on the nuances of the textual variance in the manuscripts, FitMA will provide valuable insights into the intellectual climate of the pre-modern world, highlighting the complex interplay between translators, scribes, and readers in the dissemination of Aristotle's thought."

The understanding of Aristotle’s thought was decisively shaped by Latin translations from the 12th and 13th centuries. Translators’ efforts to preserve the exact phrasing of the texts and readers’ struggles to determine the disturbingly novel meaning lie hidden in modifications and notes in the manuscripts. These have however not received the attention they deserve, leading to a significant gap in our knowledge of the medieval reception of Aristotle. FitMA aims to fill this gap through a comprehensive investigation into the new ways to read the Latin Aristotle, with a ground-breaking focus on the textual variance in the handwritten books that preserve the translations. To realize that goal, FitMA will produce state-of-the-art critical editions of Greek-Latin translations of three of Aristotle’s most influential treatises on natural philosophy: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. Critical editions are the established scholarly means to document the variant readings in all manuscript witnesses of an ancient or medieval text. The study of that variance across versions or textual fluidity provides first-hand evidence how readers were exposed to the recently available translations, which are fundamentally different from their Greek originals. Because every manuscript copy of the Latin Aristotle generates a different state for its medieval reception, which cannot be adequately studied from the Greek text or a modern translation, FitMA will advance the state of the art by uncovering the importance of textual fluidity in the manuscripts of these translations and developing an innovative model of interpretation applicable to other medieval translations of philosophy and science.",
