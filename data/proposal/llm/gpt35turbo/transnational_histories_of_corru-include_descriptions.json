        "The TransCorr project aims to investigate the historical construction of the concept of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe from 1750 to 1850, within the context of the region's transition to modernity. This period saw a proliferation of commentary from both indigenous critics and foreign observers portraying the area as rife with graft, nepotism, and bribery. These critiques were often used by political figures to advance their own agendas, linking “corruption” to the region's perceived cultural backwardness and economic underdevelopment. \n\nTransCorr seeks to explore how these notions of “corruption” were shaped by the introduction of new ideas about modernity from Western Europe, and how attempts by Great Powers to exert control over the region further entrenched these negative perceptions, particularly in relation to the Ottoman legacy. By tracing the historical development of these ideas, the project aims to shed light on the origins of contemporary debates on patronage and graft in the region, while also reconfiguring broader understandings of center-periphery relations within Europe. This research will bring the study of Central-South-East Europe into greater dialogue with global narratives of modernization and align the region's historiography with recent innovations in the scientific literature."

A wide range of foreign observers portrayed graft, nepotism, and bribery as endemic. Indigenous critics echoed many of these assessments. Regional insiders and outsiders alike mobilized commentaries on “corruption” for their own political, professional, and personal ends, claiming they could run more honest and efficient administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations than those in power. These notables linked “corruption” to the region's supposed cultural backwardness and economic under-development. In doing so, public figures naturalized notions of “corruption,” making it appear both widespread and organic in the region—popularizing tropes that have endured right down to the present. Yet, “corruption” is a historically specific concept. TransCorr seeks to construct a history of the idea of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe in conjunction with the rise of modernity. It demonstrates how in the context of new ideas about modernity emanating from West Europe, regional leaders reframed a host of traditional customs and practices as corrupt. It examines how Great Power attempts to transform these borderlands into formal and informal imperial provinces further entrenched novel understandings of “corruption”, often pejoratively associating them with the Ottoman legacy. By tracing out this history, TransCorr reveals a genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes that continue to inform analyses of and discussions within the region today. The project brings the study of this geographic area into greater dialogue with a global story of modernization and aligns the region’s historiography with new innovations in the scientific literature. It also reframes contemporary debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigures broader understandings of center-periphery relations within the region and across the continent.",
