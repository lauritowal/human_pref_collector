        "The proposed project, Multisensory Adaptations in Visual Cortex (MADVIS), aims to investigate the complex relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight-restoration in individuals who have experienced visual deprivation. By studying how the occipital cortex adapts to process non-visual inputs in blind individuals, MADVIS seeks to understand how specific brain regions change their functional tuning in response to different sensory experiences. Through an innovative interdisciplinary approach merging cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, this project will explore the impact of visual deprivation during sensitive periods in development on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. Furthermore, MADVIS will utilize this knowledge to predict and assess the outcomes of sight restoration procedures. By bridging the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of sensory plasticity and pave the way for more informed decision-making in sensory restoration interventions."

These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity, classically considered compensatory, inevitably raise crucial challenges for sight-restoration. The neglected relation between crossmodal plasticity and sight-recovery will represent the testing ground of MADVIS in order to gain important novel insights on how specific brain regions become, stay and change their functional tuning toward the processing of specific stimuli. The main goal of MADVIS is therefore to make a breakthrough on two fronts: (1) understanding how visual deprivation at different sensitive periods in development affects the functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex; and (2) use the fundamental knowledge derived from (1) to test and predict the outcome of sight restoration. Using a pioneering interdisciplinary approach that crosses the boundaries between cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, MADVIS will have a large impact on our understanding of how experience at different sensitive periods shapes the response properties of specific brain regions. Finally, in its attempt to fill the existing gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, MADVIS will eventually pave the way for a new generation of predictive surveys prior to sensory restoration.",
