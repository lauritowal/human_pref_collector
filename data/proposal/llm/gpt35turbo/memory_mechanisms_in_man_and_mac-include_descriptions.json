        "The proposed project seeks to investigate and validate a series of 10 groundbreaking claims related to the formation and maintenance of long-term sensory memories in humans. These claims suggest that individuals can recognize visual and auditory stimuli even after decades without exposure, and that memories can be formed with just a few exposures that can last a lifetime. The project will explore the role of attention-related brain activity and the creation of specialized \"Grandmother Cells\" in the neocortex for long-term memory storage. Specifically, the research will utilize a highly interdisciplinary approach involving psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development to test these claims. \n\nNovel experimental paradigms will be developed to study the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories, using imaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and intracerebral recording. Additionally, computer simulations with networks of spiking neurons and Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will be used to model the experimental results and develop bio-inspired hardware that mimics the brain's memory systems. If successful, this research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of memory storage and could lead to the development of new processing architectures that could replace conventional computing hardware."

We will test these claims with a highly interdisciplinary approach involving psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling and hardware development. Novel experimental paradigms will study the formation and maintenance of very long term sensory memories. They will be combined with imaging techniques including fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients. In parallel, computer simulations using networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will model the experimental results, and develop bio-inspired hardware that mimics the brains memory systems.",
