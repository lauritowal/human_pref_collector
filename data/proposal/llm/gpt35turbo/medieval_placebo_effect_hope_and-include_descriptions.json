    "title": "Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500",
    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of hope, belief, and trust in late medieval medicine, specifically focusing on the concept of the placebo effect. By analyzing the intellectual, social, and cultural forces that shaped healing practices in Southern Europe during this period, this project aims to shed light on the ways in which the soul/mind impacted physical health. Through a comprehensive examination of ideas, practices, and institutions involved in healing, the project will highlight the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities in medieval healing theory and technique. By understanding how these sensibilities were manipulated to instill hope, belief, and trust in patients, this research will provide valuable insights into the historical development of healing practices and their relevance to modern healthcare challenges. Ultimately, this project will pave the way for a deeper understanding of the ways in which these sensibilities continue to influence healing practices in the 21st century, particularly in the face of growing distrust of medical services and challenges in pharmaceutical research."

The therapeutic power of these sensibilities is recognized today by the modern clustering concept, placebo effect. This integrative project will identify the intellectual, social, and cultural forces in the medieval past that articulated and applied the idea that health may be improved by evoking certain sensibilities. In a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures of healing activity, I analyze the medieval placebo effect as a paradigmatic attribute of the healing of the period. The project brings into dialogue current debates on the curative role of “symbolic aspects of a therapeutic intervention” with medieval perceptions of the soul’s impact on the body. By so doing it will shed new light on the salient engagement of medieval healing practices with hope, expectations, belief, and trust as critical elements of therapy. It will demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities. It will view the breadth of the engagement with the soul/mind as a formative aspect of healing theory and technique, and will show the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in procuring hope, belief, and trust in late medieval Southern European healing. By looking beyond the term to the components that link the phenomena, this historical project will enable the examination of a health system that is simultaneously alien to and part of the underlying legacy of European medicine and will offer a new path for thinking about these issues, essential for effective healthcare. MedPlaceboEffect will thus lay the groundwork for examining the ways these sensibilities are negotiated in the 21st century as healing practices face substantial challenges such as the growing distrust of medical services, and the increasing difficulty of overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research.",
