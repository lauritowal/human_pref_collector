        "The proposed project, SACRASEC, seeks to investigate the emergence and legitimization of religious vigilantes in mega-cities of the Global South. In these urban centers where state agencies struggle to provide essential services, religious organizations and non-state security actors have formed alternative governance structures. This phenomenon challenges existing research on religion and violence, as religious vigilantes use violence systematically without seeking to overthrow the state or gain global attention. By conducting ethnographic comparisons in Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, the project aims to uncover why residents grant authority to these vigilantes and how religion plays a role in legitimizing their practices. The study will focus on Christian, Afro-Brazilian, Islamic, and Indigenous religious traditions, allowing for both generalizable conclusions about religion in alternative governance and nuanced insights into each tradition's involvement in vigilantism. By shedding light on the power dynamics in mega-cities of the Global South, this research will inform policies aimed at enhancing human security and contribute to the fields of anthropology of religion and political anthropology."

In such contexts, religious organizations and non-state security actors (vigilantes) have merged into alternative governance organizations. The emergence of religious vigilantes suggests a different connection between religion and violence than emphasized in current research on religious fundamentalism and terrorism. While religious vigilantes use violence systematically, they generally do not aim to overthrow the state, nor do they seek a global audience to witness their violence. They operate side-by-side with state actors to maintain order. Major questions are: why do mega-city residents grant these religious vigilantes authority? And what is the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices? SACRASEC will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes in mega-cities of the Global South through an ethnographic comparison of three mega-cities. The case studies focus on Christian and Afro-Brazilian religion in Rio de Janeiro; Christian, Islamic and Indigenous religion in Lagos; and Islamic and Indigenous religion in Jakarta. This comparative focus makes it possible to draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, while also enabling an analysis of the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. This research extends the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology. It will provide critically needed knowledge on the power structures in mega-cities of the Global South, and in so doing will contribute important insights to policies aimed at improving human security.",
