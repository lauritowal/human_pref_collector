        "This grant proposal seeks to address the \"missing middle\" in the literature on the fetal origins hypothesis by investigating the effects of early shocks on health and human capital formation during childhood. Leveraging high-quality administrative data from Spain over the past 35 years, this study will use state-of-the-art econometric techniques and large sample sizes to examine the causal effects of various public policies and shocks on child development. Specifically, the research will focus on five different types of shocks in early childhood - household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks. The impact of these shocks on health and cognitive development in children aged 0-15 will be evaluated using hospital and primary health care records, school grades, standardized test scores, and other data sources. Additionally, the study will explore potential channels linking these treatments to child outcomes, such as family size, parental time use, labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. The results of this research will provide valuable insights into how early life shocks can have long-term effects on human capital, with direct policy implications for improving young children's future outcomes."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 299 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nA recent literature in economics on the “fetal origins hypothesis” has documented that a range of early (prenatal and postnatal) shocks and interventions can have substantial effects on long-term human capital formation (e.g. adult health, wages). However, we still know little about the years in between early infancy and adulthood, referred to as the “missing middle”. How do early shocks affect health and human capital formation during childhood? How do the effects of different types of interventions, or shocks at different ages, compare? What are the most cost-effective ways of improving young children’s future outcomes? I aim to fill this gap in the literature by taking advantage of a range of natural experiments in a country, Spain, for which high quality administrative data are available for the past 35 years. State of the art econometric techniques, combined with large sample sizes, will allow me to evaluate credibly and precisely the causal effects of a number of different public policies and shocks on child development. I will consider five different “shocks” in early childhood (at different ages), affecting: i) Household material resources (an unconditional mother’s allowance); ii) Parental time (subsidized paternity leave); iii) Medical treatments around birth (elective delivery); iv) The availability of family planning services (access to abortion); and v) Aggregate demand shocks to different sectors of the economy. I will evaluate their impact on health and cognitive development at ages 0-15, as measured in hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores, among other data sources. I will also study the potential channels linking treatments to child outcomes, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, expenditure patterns, etc. My results will help us understand how shocks in early life can have long-term effects on human capital, with direct policy implications.",
