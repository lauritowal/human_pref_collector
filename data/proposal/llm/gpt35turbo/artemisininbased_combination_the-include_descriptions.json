    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the global drug market using artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as a case study. ACTs are the recommended treatment for malaria in Africa and showcase the complex interplay between scientific, therapeutic, popular, and commercial dimensions of pharmaceutical drugs. The project will focus on analyzing the supply and demand dynamics of ACTs in Benin and Ghana, two African countries with differing pharmaceutical systems. Additionally, a comparative study will be conducted on the drug system in Cambodia to address the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nLed by an anthropologist, the project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, collaborating with an epidemiologist to study the consumption of ACTs, and a sociologist specializing in pharmaceutical legislation to analyze local production and regulations. The research will also explore the globalizing processes affecting drug markets and their implications on public health. Through various work packages, the project will not only generate valuable insights into pharmaceutical systems in Africa and Asia but also contribute to the prevention of drug resistances spreading across continents.\n\nThe project includes a strong training component, aiming to educate 8 master students, 2 PhD candidates, and 1 post-doctoral researcher. With the PI's expertise in methodology and theory, as well as established partnerships in Benin and Ghana, the project is poised to make significant contributions to understanding and improving pharmaceutical systems in Africa while addressing critical issues related to the global drug market."

With dimensions that are simultaneously scientific, therapeutic, popular and commercial, these drugs are central to various issues. ACTs, the new recommended treatment for malaria in Africa, crystallize these issues and provide a case study to investigate the global drug market. This project proposes to use ACTs as a lens to study the realities affecting this market, both in terms of supply and demand in two African countries where the pharmaceutical systems differ significantly. This will involve analyzing the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana and to study their consequences on public health. To further compare the drug systems and to address the serious issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa, the project also proposes conducting a study on the drug system in Cambodia. The central discipline is anthropology, which is extremely relevant to the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply and to the analysis of drug use (WP1 and WP2). However, since a multidisciplinary approach is advised for drug studies, the PI will work with an epidemiologist who will study the scope of ACT consumption (WP3) and a sociologist specializing in pharmaceutical legislation who will analyze local production and ACT regulations (WP4). Opening into Asia will occur through WP5. A WP6 is devoted to project management, dissemination of results, organizing two symposiums and institutional twofold impacts: (1) to foster reflection so that more efficient pharmaceutical systems are established in Africa, and (2) to provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project includes a substantial training component: 8 master students, 2 PhD and 1 post-doct. The PI’s skills in methodology and theory and the solid partnerships she has developed in Benin and Ghana will support the project’s feasibility.",
