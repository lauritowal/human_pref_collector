        "The proposed project aims to address the critical issue of men's health and cognition by investigating how their changing family and working lives impact these outcomes. Men are more likely to die prematurely compared to women, and improving their health is essential for achieving gender equality and maximizing their contributions to society. Despite significant shifts in men's educational attainment, labor force participation, and family roles, there is limited research on how these changes influence their health and cognition. Leveraging Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data, this study will examine the relationship between men's family and working lives and their health and cognition across adulthood. Specifically, the project will focus on young adulthood and midlife, periods marked by significant family transitions and work experiences. By analyzing data from over 12,000 men spanning from their late teens to ages 36 to 69, the study will explore cohort and period differences, the impact of the male breadwinner model, fathers' involvement in childcare, and the intersection of work and family life. This research will provide valuable insights into the factors shaping men's health outcomes and cognitive abilities, informing policies and interventions aimed at improving men's well-being and overall quality of life."

Improving men’s health and cognition is not only critical for achieving gender equality, but also for enhancing and extending men’s potential to contribute to their families, the labour market and society as populations grow older. HOMME studies how men’s (changing) family and working lives influence their health and cognition. Men’s family and working lives are changing: Men now lag behind women with regards to tertiary education; female labour participation has increased while male labour participation has slightly decreased. Men are more apt to lose their job due to technological change. Male childlessness has risen dramatically, much more than female childlessness; in many Western countries, one out of four or almost one out of three men are now childless at age 40. Fathers are participating more in childcare, and men have partially lost their role as family “breadwinners”. So far, insufficient research has examined the consequences of these changes on men’s health and cognition. HOMME capitalizes on the richness of Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data to examine how men’s (rapidly changing) family and working lives are related to their health and cognition across adulthood, as well as across cohorts, periods and between communities. We focus on young adulthood and midlife – the life period most characterized by family transitions and work experiences. We examine cohort and period differences, men’s work-face interface, the male breadwinner model and fathers’ participation in childcare, and disentangle selection and causality. Our data covers genes; parents, (former) spouses and partners; self-reported, clinical, and register measures of health; register data on work participation and occupation; and cognitive trajectories of N=12,000+ men between the late teens to ages 36 to 69 (and potentially beyond, pending funding of the project).",
