        "The proposed project aims to leverage the novel models and tests developed in the ERC-funded starting grant \"Change-Point Tests\" to create a software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring key economic indicators. The lack of real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests in existing forecasting software creates a need for more reliable forecasts, especially in times of economic instability. By incorporating high frequency information, real-time monitoring, and new predictive tests into our toolbox, we aim to improve the reliability of economic forecasts. \n\nCollaborating with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, we will focus on developing a user-friendly software, creating a three-dimensional graphical representation of the monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, and ensuring accessibility of our methods to decision makers. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide innovative techniques that will enhance economic forecasts, leading to more informed economic decision making by governments, Central Banks, and firms. By improving the accuracy of economic forecasts, this software has the potential to impact economic policy making and ultimately contribute to the growth, economic stability, and social welfare of countries, firms, and individuals."

In the ERC-funded starting grant (ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests) we developed novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators (such as economic activity, financial volatility and others) as well as evaluating the reliability of model predictions. In many cases our methods improve upon the current-state-of-art. The idea of this ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant is to use these novel models and tests to develop a software/toolbox that forecasts and monitors economic indicators. Most available forecasting software lack real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests which are important for reliable forecasts especially in periods of instability. Our forecasting and monitoring toolbox can improve the reliability of forecasts as follows: (1) using a novel family of models and high frequency information (2) monitoring forecasts in real-time (3) using new predictive tests of potential breakdowns. Such economic forecasts are at the heart of economic decision making made by governments, Central Banks, and firms that are potential users of our toolbox. In this ERC PoC we will initially work with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, given contacts have already been established, in order to examine various aspects of the development of this toolbox such as: building a user-friendly software, developing a three-dimensional graphical representation of the monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, and generally making our new methods accessible to decision makers. The overall objective of this ERC PoC grant is to provide a software with innovative techniques that can improve economic forecasts and thereby economic decision making. Reliable economic forecasts can lead to prudent economic policy making and affect the growth, economic and social welfare of countries, firms and individuals.",
