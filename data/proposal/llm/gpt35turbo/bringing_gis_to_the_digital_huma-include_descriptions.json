        "This grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the exploration of place, space, and geography within the humanities by developing innovative methodologies that enable the analysis of unstructured texts in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment. Leveraging the PI's expertise in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), this project will combine technical skills from GIS and corpus linguistics to unlock new insights from a diverse range of textual sources. The overarching goal is to investigate how textual sources can be utilized within a GIS framework to enhance our understanding of the humanities. \n\nThe project will consist of two main studies: the first will focus on analyzing writings about the English Lake District across different time periods, while the second will delve into socio-economic changes and political interventions impacting mortality rates in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales. Additionally, the project will include educational components such as short courses, expert meetings, and a conference to expand the skills and knowledge base in this field. By integrating HGIS, Digital Humanities, and corpus linguistics into literary studies and history, this project aims to establish new methodologies that can be applied to a wide range of textual sources. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary project has the potential to redefine research practices within the humanities and have a lasting impact on scholarship in this area."

Building on the PIâ€™s considerable experience in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), its key aim is to develop and apply methodologies that allow unstructured texts, including books, newspapers and official reports, to be analysed in a GIS environment. The first part of the project will develop these methodologies using technical skills from GIS and corpus linguistics. To truly make a difference to humanities scholarship more broadly, we will apply these techniques to conduct two different but related studies. The first, running in parallel with the methodological development, will analyse qualitative sources to explore writing about the English Lake District before, during and after the Romantic era. The second will broaden the range of sources and the topic by using an extensive range of quantitative and qualitative material to conduct a detailed study of how socio-economic changes and political interventions led to (and sometimes failed to lead to) mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales. A fourth strand of the project will use short courses, expert meetings and a conference to broaden the skills-base in the field. Our themes are diverse however our central research question is clear: how can we exploit textual sources within a GIS to broaden our understanding of the humanities. In answering this we will use a highly inter-disciplinary approach that brings together HGIS, Digital Humanities and corpus linguistics, and applies them to literary studies and history. The techniques developed will be capable of being applied to any corpus from ancient manuscripts to modern newspapers and e-resources. This is thus a field defining project that will make a major impact within the humanities and beyond.",
