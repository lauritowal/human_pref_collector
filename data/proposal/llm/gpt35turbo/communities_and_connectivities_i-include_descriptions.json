        "The proposed project, titled COMMIOS, aims to revolutionize our understanding of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) through the integration of cutting-edge methods such as genome-wide ancient DNA analysis and isotope analysis. By conducting the first comprehensive study of genetic clusters in Iron Age populations in the UK and Europe, the project seeks to uncover ancient population dynamics and their relationships to modern genetic patterns. Through the combination of genetic, isotope, osteoarchaeological, and cultural archaeological analyses, the project will address crucial questions regarding population movement, inter-regional connectivity, social structures, and household compositions in Iron Age societies. By leveraging the expertise of a team of world-leading researchers in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, and cultural archaeology, COMMIOS represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary effort that will set a new standard for archaeological research in Europe and beyond. The project's innovative approach and ambitious scope have the potential to transform our understanding of prehistoric societies and establish a new benchmark for future archaeological studies in other regions and time periods."

COMMIOS integrates these cutting-edge methods on a scale not previously attempted, within a ground-breaking interdisciplinary framework, to provide a radically new vision of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) within their wider European context. At the broad scale, we will conduct the first concerted programme of genome-wide ancient DNA analysis on Iron Age populations anywhere in the world (c. 1000 individuals in the UK, 250 in Europe), mapping genetic clusters to shed light on ancient populations themselves and on their relationships to modern genetic patterning. Together with isotope analysis, and underpinned by both osteoarchaeological and cultural archaeological approaches, this will also enable us to directly address critical issues of population movement and inter-regional connectivity in Iron Age Europe. We will utilise the power of these new scientific methods to examine the structure and social dynamics of Iron Age societies in Britain, including household and kin-group composition, the identification of familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. Previously the preserve of cultural anthropologists studying recent societies, we will draw these questions into the archaeological domain, opening up new areas of enquiry for prehistoric societies. The scope and scale of the project represents a new departure for European archaeology, made possible by the coming-of-age of new analytical methods. Many of these have been pioneered by the project team, which comprises world-leaders in the fields of ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling and cultural archaeology. Although focussed on Iron Age Britain, the project will establish a new benchmark for future analyses of other regions and periods in Europe and beyond.",
