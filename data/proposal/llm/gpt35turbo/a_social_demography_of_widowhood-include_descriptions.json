        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a ground-breaking research project focused on establishing a social demography of widowhood. Widowhood is a critical event that entails profound grief, and with the increasing frequency of this high-risk event in ageing societies, it is essential to understand its short- and long-term consequences. The proposed research aims to go beyond the current state-of-the-art by innovatively conceptualizing and methodologically approaching the risk and vulnerability of widowhood.\n\nThe project will focus on assessing the probability, duration, mental health, and economic consequences of widowhood, considering both expected and unexpected scenarios. Additionally, the research will examine social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age, as well as country differences and changes over time.\n\nUtilizing high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources from up to 60 ageing countries, varying in demographic trends and welfare systems, the project will apply advanced statistical methods from 1985 with projections to 2050. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates on the risk and vulnerability of widowhood, offer insights into the challenges faced by the growing widowed population and their families, and facilitate the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems."

Although the frequency of this high risk event is increasing across ageing societies, many countries have cut survival benefits exposing more bereaved spouses to dire short- and long-term consequences. Despite its growing relevance, widowhood research remains underdeveloped compared to other disruptive events, such as divorce. This ground-breaking research moves beyond the state-of-the-art in at least four ways to establish a social demography of widowhood. (1) The foundation of my project lies in an innovative conceptual and methodological approach to the risk and vulnerability to widowhood. While risk aims at the probability and duration of widowhood, vulnerability focuses on its mental health and economic consequences. Current assessments of widowhood effects are limited to change in wellbeing directly after bereavement with a special focus on unexpected deaths. However, the most prevalent scenario entails a process of terminal health decline in the years before death. The consequences of the often neglected longer process of expected widowhood may be larger than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood. Three ground-breaking pillars build on risk and vulnerability to examine (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity and nativity, social support networks, gender and age, as well as (3) country differences and (4) change over time. High-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources will be harmonized and applied to an advanced set of statistical methods for up to 60 ageing countries varying in demographic trends and welfare systems from 1985 with projections to 2050. A social demography of widowhood will supplement fragmented evidence with systematic and comprehensive estimates on risk and vulnerability, provide insights into the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems.",
