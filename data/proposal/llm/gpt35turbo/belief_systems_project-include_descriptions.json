        "This grant proposal seeks to fund the Belief Systems Project, a research initiative aimed at advancing the understanding of belief systems in democratic politics, extremism, and political decision-making. The project challenges the current conceptualization of belief systems as theoretical latent variables and instead proposes a novel approach that views belief systems as systems of interconnecting attitudes and values. By analyzing attitudes and values as interactive nodes in a network using network analyses, the project aims to uncover the structure and dynamics of belief systems that are currently lost in traditional assessments. \n\nThe project will push belief systems research beyond the current state-of-the-art in four key ways: mapping the structure of systems of attitudes and values, answering classic questions about central concepts and clustering of belief systems, modeling within-person belief systems to accurately predict partisan motivated reasoning, and testing how external and internal pressures impact the underlying structure and dynamics of belief systems. Through a combination of survey data, longitudinal panel studies, intensive longitudinal designs, experiments, and text analyses, the project will triangulate on the structure of political belief systems across time, countries, and individuals. This research has the potential to revolutionize the field of belief systems research and provide valuable insights into political decision-making processes."

What is the basic structure of belief systems? Clear answers to this fundamental question are not forthcoming. This is due to flaws in the conceptualization of belief systems. The state-of-the-art treats a belief system as a theoretical latent variable that causes people’s responses on attitudes and values relevant to the belief system. This approach cannot assess a belief system because it cannot assess the network of connections between the beliefs–attitudes and values–that make up the system; it collapses across them and the interrelationships are lost. The Belief Systems Project conceptualizations belief systems as systems of interconnecting attitudes and values. I conceptualize attitudes and values as interactive nodes in a network that are analysed with network analyses. With these conceptual and empirical tools, I can understand the structure and dynamics of the belief system and will be able to avoid theoretical pitfalls common in belief system assessments. This project will move belief systems research beyond the state-of-the-art in four ways by: 1. Mapping the structure of systems of attitudes and values, something that is not possible using current methods. 2. Answering classic questions about central concepts and clustering of belief systems. 3. Modeling within-person belief systems and their variations, so that I can make accurate predictions about partisan motivated reasoning. 4. Testing how external and internal pressures (e.g., feelings of threat) change the underlying structure and dynamics of belief systems. Using survey data from around the world, longitudinal panel studies, intensive longitudinal designs, experiments, and text analyses, I will triangulate on the structure of political belief systems over time, between countries, and within individuals.",
