        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a research project aimed at investigating the effects of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) on children, adults, and families. Building upon previous mixed findings and methodological limitations, this project will utilize large datasets from population registers and surveys to comprehensively analyze the impact of MAR on various domains of life, including physical and mental health, education, and union stability. By comparing the outcomes of individuals conceived through MAR to their spontaneously conceived siblings and assessing the effects on different family members, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the potential benefits and drawbacks of MAR treatments. \n\nThe innovative research designs proposed in this project will allow for a more robust examination of the causal relationship between MAR and well-being, potentially yielding ground-breaking results that could shape future research in the field. Furthermore, the findings from this study are expected to have significant policy implications, informing health professionals, public health authorities, and policymakers on how to best support families undergoing MAR treatments and mitigate any negative effects on health and well-being. By addressing this gap in the existing literature and providing valuable insights for both research and policy, this project has the potential to contribute to the advancement of public health and the well-being of families in advanced societies."

In advanced societies, the number of MAR treatments increases every year, and, over the last four decades, more than five million MAR conceived children were born, and many more families received treatment. Given this trend, it is a public health prerogative to find out whether MAR affects the well-being of families. Prior findings are mixed and often hampered by low statistical power or conceptual limitations. I propose a programme of research that goes beyond the state-of-the-art by being the first to analyze comprehensively the effects of MAR on children, adults, and families through a combination of uniquely rich data, previously unused research designs, and conceptual innovations. First, in contrast to past work using small or convenience samples, I use extremely detailed and large datasets from population registers and surveys. Second, I compare the impact of MAR on different domains of life by analysing its effects on a range of adult and child outcomes (e.g., physical/mental health, education, union stability), thereby allowing me to investigate trade-offs that have not been previously tested. Third, I use innovative research designs to test whether the impact of MAR is causal by comparing children conceived through MAR treatments to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and adults who successfully conceive through MAR to those who are unsuccessful. The project has the potential to produce ground-breaking results that will impact future research in this field. Moreover, the project will have important policy implications, as its findings will be immediately relevant to health professionals advising couples seeking MAR treatments, to public health authorities allocating resources to mitigate the potentially negative effects of MAR on health, and to policy-makers considering whether to (further) subsidize MAR treatments.",
