        "This grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the economics of information services by investigating the strategic interactions between agents involved in the production and exchange of information services, with a particular focus on externalities. The prevalence of externalities in information services is attributed to various factors, including network dynamics, the public good nature of information, and the complementary relationship between information services and physical infrastructures.\n\nThe proposal is structured into four key parts. The first part involves the development of theoretical frameworks using innovative methods such as global games and coordination games. The second part will explore specific issues related to information services, such as the design of recommendation systems and privacy considerations. Additionally, empirical investigations will be conducted on online transaction costs using proprietary e-commerce data.\n\nThe third part will delve into the physical layer of information services, examining topics like net neutrality, data pricing, and dynamic investment models. The final part of the proposal aims to develop tools that can assist competition policy makers in navigating the complexities of two-sided markets.\n\nOverall, this grant proposal seeks to contribute new insights and theoretical advancements to the field of information services economics, with the ultimate goal of informing policy decisions and enhancing the efficiency of information service markets."

In this context, externalities play a key role explored by this proposal. Their increasing prevalence in information services can be traced to three features: - Many information services involve one-sided or two-sided network externalities. - Information is a public good and the production and exchange of information between two parties may affect other parties in a positive or negative manner. - Information services and physical infrastructures are complements. Externalities arise in the two layers of the information society, the content level and the physical infrastructure. The proposal is then organized around four parts: 1. Background theory: two-sided markets, network dynamics, contractual externalities 2. Virtual layer: recommendation systems, privacy, transaction costs 3. Physical layer: pricing , investment 4. Competition policy for two-sided markets The first part consists of the development of relevant theory with original and novel methods including for instance global games, coordination games and recent contract theory. The second part studies specific issues in information services such as the design of search engines and the right to privacy. It also includes empirical investigation of on-line transaction costs using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms. The third part is concerned with the infrastructure. It studies net-neutrality and the prices of data from the perspective of price theory, accounting for the gratuity of some services. It will also develop original dynamic investment models to understand the role of the complementarity between infrastructure and service innovation and the role of legacy. The last part will develop tools for competition policy makers.",
