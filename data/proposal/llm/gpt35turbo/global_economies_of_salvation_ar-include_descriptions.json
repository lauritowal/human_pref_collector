        "The proposed project, titled \"Negotiating Sanctity: Artworks and the Roman Curia in the Age of Iberian Hegemony,\" seeks to examine how artworks played a crucial role in the process of negotiating sanctity with the Roman Curia during the post-Tridentine period. Focusing on the artworks produced in relation to Catholic blesseds and saints connected to the Iberian empires, the project aims to address the gap in art history concerning local constructions of sanctity in the context of European expansion. By investigating how artworks were used to gain recognition for saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories, the project hypothesizes that these artworks reveal a negotiation of the spiritual status of local Catholic communities within the broader framework of universal Catholicism.\n\nThrough tracing the circulation of material objects and iconographies within global networks of knowledge transmission, the project will develop a theoretical framework based on concepts from critical sociology to analyze a hypothetical 'global market of symbolic values.' By challenging established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world, the project aims to 'globalize' the history of early modern art and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of power and identity in the age of Iberian hegemony."

As the cult of the saints was among the key conceptual battlegrounds in the conflict between the Catholic church and the Protestants, in the post-Tridentine period, saints came to fulfill spiritual, ideological and propagandistic purposes. Art history has paid heightened attention to the adherence of artworks to the models of sanctity formulated by the Tridentine church, leading to an overall neglect of competing local constructions of sanctity, a shortfall particularly momentous with regard to blesseds and saints connected in different ways to the process of European expansion, specifically to the Iberian empires. The hypothesis under examination is that the artworks produced in relation to gaining recognition by the Church of saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories reveal an underlying negotiation of the local Catholic communities’ spiritual status within universal Catholicism. As official recognition affirmed the society which had made a saint its own, artworks related to this process served purposes of self-representation within the broader framework of social identity formation. GLOBECOSAL traces the circulation of material objects and iconographies within and between global networks of knowledge transmission, and combines this approach with a hypothetical ‘global market of symbolic values’ developed on the basis of concepts from critical sociology. Investigating the negotiation of sanctity between Rome and geographically distant areas participates in ‘globalizing’ the history of early modern art and is qualified to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world at large.",
