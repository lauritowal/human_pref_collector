        "This interdisciplinary grant proposal aims to investigate the factors influencing the varying degrees of authority granted to International Organizations (IOs) over time. The project will develop a theoretical model integrating a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach by drawing from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. Through a comparative analysis of the institutional empowerment of four IOs (EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, NATO) from 1986 to 2010, the project will explore how temporal dynamics, principal cohesion, and delegation contract design impact the evolution of IO authority. By conducting extensive qualitative research in IO archives and elite interviews with officials, this project seeks to contribute to theory-building and hypothesis-testing in International Relations. Ultimately, this research will provide new insights into the implications of power delegation to IOs, enhancing our understanding of international governance and advancing knowledge in the field."

At varying levels states have surrendered some authority to IOs, giving them different levels of institutional empowerment. While in the EU and IMF there has been a steadily extension of their competences, in the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO the degree of delegated authority has remained constant. How can we explain these different degrees of authority granted to IOs and their evolution over time? We argue that institutional empowerment is a function of temporal dynamics, the degree of cohesion among principals, and the institutional design of the delegation contract. On the theoretical side, the aim of the proposed interdisciplinary project is to produce theory-driven knowledge by developing a model of power delegation to IOs that integrates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach. This will be done by resorting to four different disciplines: political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. On the empirical side, the main novelty of the project consists in adopting a comparative research design and a longitudinal perspective. We will analyse the institutional empowerment of four different IOs (EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO) over a period of 26 years (1986-2010). Given the aim and scope of this research, the project is to be regarded as theory-building and hypothesis-testing research. It will be based on extensive qualitative work conducted in the archives of these four IOs as well as on elite interviews with national and international officials. With this project we will gain new insights into the consequences of power delegation to IOs and advance theoretical insights and empirical research in International Relations.",
