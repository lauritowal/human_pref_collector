        "This grant proposal outlines a research project focused on the intersection of natural language semantics and the paradoxes of truth, specifically addressing the complex relationship between belief, assumption, and truth conditions in sentences of natural language. The project seeks to bridge the gap between semanticists and philosophical logicians by providing a unified perspective on truth-conditional semantics and theories of self-applicable truth. The research will be divided into two interrelated parts: Truth in Semantics, which aims to develop semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language that incorporate modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and conditionals; and Truth and the Foundations of Semantics, which explores the role of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics from a metasemantic perspective. By addressing the challenges posed by sentences like \"Anne believes that Bob's assumption is false\" and their implications for truth conditions, the project will contribute to a deeper understanding of truth and semantics in natural language. This holistic approach represents the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, offering new insights and potential solutions to longstanding problems in the field."

Does Anne believe that Bob's assumption is false?\" Don't try too hard answering the question - any straightforward attempt will lead to paradox. But what are we to make of sentences such as \"Anne believes that Bob's assumption is false.\" Is the sentence true or false? On the face of it, it would seem that answering this question is a pressing problem for natural language semantics that assigns truth conditions to sentences of natural language. However, semanticists have largely ignored problems of this kind, leaving the field to philosophical logicians working on paradoxes, in particular, the paradoxes of truth such as the Liar paradox. But research on the paradoxes of truth has often focused on exploring the space of possible coherent \"solutions\" to the paradoxes thereby ignoring desiderata of natural language semantics. The project provides a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics, and the research on the so-called semantic paradoxes in form of theories of self-applicable truth. A unified approach to truth and semantics will need to answer two principal challenges, which divides the research project into two interrelated parts. The first part, Truth in Semantics, aims at developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, that is, fragments in which, besides the notion of truth, we allow for, e.g., modal expressions, propositional attitudes but also natural language conditionals. The second part, Truth and the Foundations of Semantics, assumes a metasemantic perspective and explores the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics. The project constitutes the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from such a combined perspective.",
