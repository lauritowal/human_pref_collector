        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a pioneering research project that will investigate the institutional dimensions impacting teachers' careers and the teaching profession across Europe. The project aims to address the issues of low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages within the profession by achieving four main objectives. These objectives include analyzing teacher policy changes over the past three decades in Belgium, France, and England, understanding the evolving status of the teaching profession and its influence on workforce diversification, examining the processes of teacher allocation into varied working conditions, and predicting teacher attrition and migration patterns within a multilevel framework. The project will utilize a post-comparative mixed-method design, incorporating policy analysis, secondary data analysis, qualitative studies, and multilevel multi-group analyses. By investigating teacher recruitment, career trajectories, labor markets, and mobility patterns, this project aims to generate new theoretical insights into the labor markets for teachers and contribute to the understanding of institutional change in educational systems. Ultimately, this research will offer valuable knowledge to inform policy decisions and enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of teacher recruitment and retention strategies in European educational systems."

The functioning of the profession suffers from low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This proposal constitutes the first systematic comparative project in Europe aimed at understanding the role of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the teaching profession as a whole. It has four objectives: [1] to explain the nature of teacher policy over the last thirty years in different educational systems (Belgium, France and England); [2] to understand the changing status of the teaching profession and its impact on the diversification of the teaching workforce; [3] to analyse the processes by which teachers are allocated into increasingly diverse working and professional conditions; and [4] to model and predict teacher attrition and migration within a common but differentiated multilevel framework. This project will adopt a post-comparative mixed-method design organized around four work packages on teacher policy, supply, labour markets and mobility. It will combine five methods: policy analysis of teachers’ recruitment and careers; secondary data analyses of relevant national and international datasets on teacher supply and the profession’s attractiveness; a qualitative, in-depth study of three national labour-market spaces; multilevel multi-group analyses of original datasets on teacher mobility, and semi-structured interviews with non-entrants and early leavers. This project will produce new theoretical knowledge about labour markets for teachers and contribute to the reconceptualization of the nature of institutional change affecting educational systems in a society characterized by the progressive decline of nation states, increased interdependence between societal fields and the fragmentation of individual life spheres.",
