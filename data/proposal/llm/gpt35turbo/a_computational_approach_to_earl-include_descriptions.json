        "This grant proposal aims to address the puzzling phenomenon of how infants acquire phonemes, words, and phonological rules in parallel during their first year of life. Leveraging Machine Learning and Automatic Speech Recognition techniques, we will develop a model to simulate this early language acquisition process. This model will be tested on large spontaneous speech databases in Japanese, French, and Dutch, with predictions validated through behavioral, EEG, and fNIRS studies on infants. \n\nThe proposed research will focus on four key areas: coding, lexicon, rules, and integration. Through the study of speech coding features and linguistic units in infants at different ages, we aim to uncover a hierarchy of linguistic units. By modifying word segmentation algorithms to work on raw speech data, we will investigate the early development of a large lexicon in infants. Additionally, we will explore how infants navigate coarticulated gestures to understand phonological rules, testing predictive models of coarticulation in auditory space. Finally, we will develop a method to iteratively integrate approximate phoneme, word, and rule representations to derive more accurate linguistic models.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will be evaluated using adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases, comparing the results to state-of-the-art phoneme recognizers. Predictions generated from the model will be tested in infants learning artificial languages and through longitudinal studies. Ultimately, this project aims to provide new insights into the early language acquisition process and contribute to the development of more effective language learning models."

After 30 years of accumulated experimental results, we are still lacking an account for the puzzling fact that these 3 interdependent components of language are acquired not sequentially, but in parallel. Drawing tools from Machine Learning and Automatic Speech Recognition, we construct a model of this early process, test it on 2 large spontaneous speech databases (Japanese, French and Dutch) and test its predictions in infants using behavioral, EEGs and fNIRS techniques. 1. Coding. We study different ways of defining coding features for speech, from fine-grained to coarse grained, in view of the automatic discovery of a hierarchy of linguistic units. We compare this with a systematic study of the units of speech coding as they unfold in 6, 9 and 12 month old infants.. 2. Lexicon. Infants recognize some words before they know the phonemes of their language; we modify existing word segmentation algorithms so they can work on raw speech. We test the unique prediction that infants start with a large lexicon thatâ€™s quite different from the adult one. 3. Rules. Phonemes are produced as overlapping, coarticulated gestures. To untangle these context effects, we use a predictive model of coarticulation in auditory space and invert it. We test when and how infants perform reverse coarticulation. 4. Integration. The above subprojects provide only an initial bootstrapping into approximate phonemes, words, and contextual rules. We show how to iteratively integrate these approximate representations to derive better ones. The outcome will be numerically assessed on an adult directed and infant directed speech database, and compared to those of to state-of-the-art supervized phoneme recognizers. The predictions will be tested in infants learning artificial languages and in a longitudinal study.",
