        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project focused on developing inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity using longitudinal data. The project consists of three blocks addressing key challenges in modern applications of panel data. The first block aims to enhance statistical hypothesis tests for nonlinear models, focusing on uncertainty in the data rather than point estimation. The second block focuses on estimating models for network data, utilizing the panel structure of the data. The third block aims to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables, areas lacking formal results despite their importance in labor economics and industrial organization. The proposed tools will be theoretically assessed, tested via simulation, and applied to empirical problems such as the labor force participation margin and the determinants of import and export behavior in firms and countries. This project addresses a critical need in econometric practice by reconciling unobserved heterogeneity with panel data models, providing a more realistic and accurate framework for economic analysis."

Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in economic modeling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. The aim of this project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three blocks. Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel data. The first block deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second block makes progress on the estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third block uses panel data to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and they will be applied to various empirical problems. Two examples of applications that we will study are the extensive margin of labor force participation and the determinants of the import and export behavior of firms and countries.",
