        "This grant proposal aims to address the growing disengagement of citizens from politics in Europe by examining the effects of delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on support for representative democracy. The project will investigate whether these institutional reforms, aimed at revitalizing democracy, actually have a healing or harming effect on citizens' engagement with representative politics. The central hypothesis is that there is no universal and univocal impact of non-elected politics on support for representative democracy.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, data will be collected across Europe in three main areas. First, a detailed study will be conducted on the preferences of Europeans regarding how democracy should function and their views on institutional reforms towards non-elected politics. Second, a comprehensive inventory of all cases of empowerment of citizens and experts implemented across Europe since 2000 will be compiled. Finally, an analysis will be conducted on the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on citizens' attitudes towards representative democracy.\n\nBy using an innovative combination of online survey experiments and panel surveys, this research project will provide valuable insights into the relationship between non-elected politics and support for representative democracy, with implications for addressing the crisis of citizen disengagement from politics in Europe."

Electoral turnout reaches historically low levels. Anti-establishment and populist parties are on the rise. Fewer and fewer Europeans trust their representative institutions. In response, we have observed a multiplication of institutional reforms aimed at revitalizing representative democracy. Two in particular stand out: the delegation of some political decision-making powers to (1) selected citizens and to (2) selected experts. But there is a paradox in attempting to cure the crisis of representative democracy by introducing such reforms. In representative democracy, control over political decision-making is vested in elected representatives. Delegating political decision-making to selected experts/citizens is at odds with this definition. It empowers the non-elected. If these reforms show that politics could work without elected officials, could we really expect that citizens’ support for representative democracy would be boosted and that citizens would re-engage with representative politics? In that sense, would it be a cure for the crisis of representative democracy, or rather a curse? Our central hypothesis is that there is no universal and univocal healing (or harming) effect of non-elected politics on support for representative democracy. In order to verify it, I propose to collect data across Europe on three elements: (1) a detailed study of the preferences of Europeans on how democracy should work and on institutional reforms towards non-elected politics, (2) a comprehensive inventory of all actual cases of empowerment of citizens and experts implemented across Europe since 2000, and (3) an analysis of the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on citizens’ attitudes towards representative democracy. An innovative combination of online survey experiments and of panel surveys will be used to answer this topical research question with far-reaching societal implication.",
