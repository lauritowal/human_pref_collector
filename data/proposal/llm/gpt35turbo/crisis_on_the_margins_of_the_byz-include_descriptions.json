    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project that aims to investigate the factors influencing the long-term sustainability of complex societies under vulnerable conditions. Focusing on the Byzantine early Christian urban centers of the Negev Desert from the 4th to 7th centuries AD, the research will explore both the successes and failures of a society that faced challenges of social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and potential disease outbreaks. By integrating multiple archaeological approaches and data sources, including biomolecular, botanical, zoological, geological, and artifactual evidence, the project seeks to shed light on the mechanisms that lead to societal collapse or resilience in resource-limited environments.\n\nThe study of societal vulnerability in marginal regions is particularly relevant in today's global context, where issues related to environmental degradation and sustainable development are becoming increasingly pressing. By analyzing the historical record of past societies, this project aims to generate new insights that can inform current practices and help anticipate future challenges. Through the collection and analysis of high-quality data, the research will contribute to both theoretical and empirical understandings of the limits of human ingenuity in balancing social and economic development with environmental sustainability. Ultimately, this project has the potential to generate significant advancements in our knowledge of societal vulnerability and resilience, with implications for addressing contemporary global challenges."

The broad aim of the research is to explore contexts of collapse and resilience in an ancient society with high levels of socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity within a resource-limited environment. It focuses on the Byzantine early Christian urban centres of the Negev Desert (4th-7th cent. AD) disclosing both the triumph of human ingenuity in conquering the desert through large-scale human settlement and agricultural development as well as a striking and as yet ambiguous case of wholesale systemic collapse. To test hypotheses regarding social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation due to climatic or anthropogenic causes, and the question of plague the project integrates approaches in the archaeology of households, landscapes and garbage through use of biomolecular, botanical, zoological, geological, chronometric, artifactual and contextual sources of data. Dealing with societal vulnerability in marginal regions is timely and relevant in a world where accelerating development rapidly expands such problems, previously localized, to global levels. Although it is a risky endeavour to engage the record of past societies to inform the present and forecast the future due to the typically underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, this project offers substantial gain to theoretical and empirical research on societal vulnerability in two main avenues: (1) providing an opportunity to critically re-evaluate the current state of knowledge in the field based on an extensive corpus of new, high-quality data and (2) drawing more nuanced and informed broad generalizations regarding limiting states for human ingenuity in reconciling social and economic development with sustainable management of the environment and its resources.",
