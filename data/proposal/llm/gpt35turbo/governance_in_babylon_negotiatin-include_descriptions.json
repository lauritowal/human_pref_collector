        "The proposed project, GoviB, seeks to conduct a historical study of governance in ancient Babylon, focusing on the transition from a local to a more global form of governance during the late 8th to the 4th century BC. By analyzing newly available Neo-Babylonian archival texts from the German excavations in Babylon, this research aims to shed light on how imperial rule was negotiated locally and the strategies employed by rulers and the ruled in pursuit of their interests. By applying a governance studies framework to the historical evidence, this project aims to provide a novel understanding of politics and authority in ancient Babylon, ultimately leading to a re-evaluation of modern perceptions of ‘oriental’ governance. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of what causes states to be stable or unstable, and how regime changes succeed or fail. The Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin has granted the researcher access to this valuable museum treasure trove for the GoviB project, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the historical material. By examining the interdependencies and interactions between actors and non-personal factors that influenced decision-making in ancient Babylon, this research will provide a new balanced evaluation of the role that empires played in the cultural transformation of the ancient Near East."

Babylonia is the earliest society in the ancient world that produced sufficient indigenous sources that allow studying the transition from a strongly anchored local to a more ‘global’ (imperial), de-nationalized form of governance. From the late 8th to the 4th century BC, Babylon experienced two major regime changes and was consecutively ruled by three empires – the Assyrian, the Chaldean and the (first) Persian. While the regime changes and other events are known as historical facts, little is known about how imperial rule was negotiated locally and how the strategies which rulers and ruled applied in pursuit of their interests interacted and led to instability or stability. The reasons are incomplete historical data, and difficulties to interpret available ambivalent or conflicting data. With GoviB I want to achieve a novel understanding of politics and authority in the ancient city of Babylon, leading to a new balanced evaluation of the role which the empires played in the long-term cultural transformation of the ancient Near East. The results will contribute to a re-evaluation of modern perceptions of ‘oriental’ governance as absolute or ‘despotic’, and to the wider question of what causes states to be stable or instable, and how regime changes fail or succeed. I will achieve these goals by analysing newly available textual and archaeological material: the Neo-Babylonian archival texts from the German excavations in Babylon. The Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin granted me the rights to put this museum treasure trove to use for GoviB. Furthermore, I will apply the conceptual framework of governance studies to the historical evidence. Its heuristic value lies in the fact that it relocates the focus from government to governance, that is, the interdependencies and interactions between actors, and it includes non-personal factors that influenced decision-making.",
