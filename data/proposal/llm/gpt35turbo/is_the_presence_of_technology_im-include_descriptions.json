        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of advanced technologies on corporations and investors, focusing on three key areas: communication with shareholders, environmental and social (ES) issues, and compensation. The study aims to understand how technological advancements are shaping corporate practices and investor decisions, ultimately affecting wealth and prosperity. \n\nThe first pillar will explore the shift of shareholder meetings from in-person to virtual settings due to Covid-19, analyzing how this change has impacted communication between shareholders and firms. Initial findings suggest that virtual-only meetings may have limited shareholder voice and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing shareholder questions.\n\nThe second pillar will delve into whether investors prioritize firms' stated actions on environmental and social issues (ES) or their actual actions. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to evaluate discrepancies between what firms claim to do and what they actually do in terms of ES initiatives. The study will investigate how the market rewards firms based on their statements versus actions in promoting ES goals.\n\nThe third pillar will focus on how characteristics such as gender affect employee compensation in the tech industry, analyzing how employee benefits contribute to economic welfare and individual prosperity. This research aims to provide insights into how technological developments are shaping corporate behavior and impacting investors and employees alike."

Technology is changing how investors interact with companies, how investors analyze and interpret the information provided by companies, and even the standard design of compensation in corporations. The goal of this study is to understand whether and how the increasing presence of technology is improving corporations and contributing to the wealth and prosperity of individuals/ investors, and when it is not. I will focus on the following three pillars that each focus on a unique technological development: (1) Communication with shareholders. Aim: To understand whether shareholders’ voice at shareholder meetings is muted following the shift of shareholder meetings from the in-person to the virtual-only arena (due to Covid-19). Initial findings indicate that this shift has minimized communication between shareholders and firms and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing questions submitted by shareholders. (2) Environment and social (ES) issues. Aim: To understand whether investors pay attention to what firms say they do on ES issues, or what they actually do. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to evaluate which actions firms state that they take with respect to ES, and these will be compared to the ES actions firms actually take. Initial results indicate that the market rewards firms that state they take actions promoting ES goals, but not firms that actually take such actions. (3) Compensation. – Aim: To examine how the characteristics of employees (e.g., gender) working in the tech industry relate to the EBC they receive, and their ability to maximize the value of their EBC and changes the economic landscape and welfare of individuals.",
