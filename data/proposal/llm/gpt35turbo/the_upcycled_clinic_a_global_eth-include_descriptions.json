    "title": "The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine",
    "descriptions": [
        "The Upcycled Clinic is an innovative ethnographic project seeking to address the issue of wastefulness in healthcare settings, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. By focusing on creative practices such as repurposing materials within clinics, this project aims to shed light on overlooked actors like cleaners and laundry staff, as well as explore open datasets of pandemic improvisations. Through fieldwork in diverse locations including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and U.K., the team of ethnographers will compare conditions that foster or hinder creative material engagement in healthcare settings. \n\nThis project will advance the social study of medicine in several key ways. First, by shifting the focus to materials, it expands the scope of hospital ethnographies beyond patient interactions. Second, it will provide a global perspective on improvisation in clinics, offering valuable insights into innovative practices worldwide. Third, the project will develop new methodologies for reusing and sharing research materials in ethnography, incorporating sensory methods and reducing data waste. \n\nUltimately, The Upcycled Clinic aims to provide empirical insights into theories of materiality, resilience, and innovation in healthcare workplaces. By identifying conditions that promote creativity and sustainability in healthcare settings, this project will contribute to the development of local solutions to wastefulness and shortages in the medical field."

Hospitals in particular have become nodes of disposability. Solutions to this problem has to date attracted mostly the attention of medical technology companies promoting circular economies, a model still reliant on production and technological innovation. The Upcycled Clinic takes a different direction. This ethnographic project focuses on creative practices such as repurposing in the clinic, involving making the most of existing materials. Five sub-projects have been carefully selected with illuminating examples around the world including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S and U.K. A team of ethnographers will conduct fieldwork and interviews with a range of actors, many often overlooked, such as cleaners and laundry staff, and look at open datasets of pandemic improvisations. The overarching objective is, through comparison, to better understand conditions which cultivate and curtail creative material engagement in the clinic. This inventive and timely contribution to the social study of medicine will advance the field in at least three directions. First, by attending more closely to materials, it moves hospital ethnographies beyond current focus on the patient encounter. Second, it will offer the first globally orientated study of improvisation in the clinic. Third, it breaks new methodological ground in the social sciences by developing novel ways of reusing and sharing research material in ethnography that adopts sensory methods and rethinks data waste. These contributions from the rich case of the clinic will add empirical insights to theories of materiality and help address long standing questions regarding resilience and innovation in the workplace. Practically, the study will articulate conditions under which healthcare can leverage creativity and pay better attention to local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.",
