        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the neural bases of infant learning, focusing on statistical computations and symbolic competence from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. The project consists of 6 work packages utilizing non-invasive brain-imaging techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography. The first work package will determine the preterm age at which statistical inferences can be demonstrated using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. The second work package will examine the impact of different pre-term environments on early statistical computations in the visual and auditory domains. Work package three will explore how infants infer word meaning and word category, with a focus on the role of the left perisylvian areas and their connectivity. Work package four will assess infant symbolic competency through various experiments testing generalization, bidirectionality, algebraic rules, and logical operations. Additionally, work packages five and six will utilize MRI to accurately localize brain function and develop tools to analyze multimodal brain images. By investigating these aspects of infant learning, this project aims to elucidate the specific neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the inception of cortical circuits."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 292 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nInfant is the most powerful learner: He learns in a few months to master language, complex social interactions, etc. Powerful statistical algorithms, simultaneously acting at the different levels of functional hierarchies have been proposed to explain learning. I propose here that two other elements are crucial. The first is the particular human cerebral architecture that constrains statistical computations. The second is the humanâ€™s ability to access a rich symbolic system. I have planned 6 work packages using the complementary information offered by non-invasive brain-imaging techniques (EEG, MRI and optical topography) to understand the neural bases of infant statistical computations and symbolic competence from 6 months of gestation up until the end of the first year of life. WP1 studies from which preterm age, statistical inferences can be demonstrated using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 investigates the consequences of a different pre-term environment (in-utero versus ex-utero) on the early statistical computations in the visual and auditory domains and their consequences on the ongoing brain activity along the first year of life. WP3 explores the neural bases of how infants infer word meaning and word category, and in particular the role of the left perisylvian areas and of their particular connectivity. WP4 questions infant symbolic competency. I propose several criteria (generalization, bidirectionality, use of algebraic rules and of logical operations) tested in successive experiments to clarify infant symbolic abilities during the first semester of life. WP5-6 are transversal to WP1-4: WP5 uses MRI to obtain accurate functional localization and maturational markers correlated with functional results. In WP6, we develop new tools to combine and analyse multimodal brain images. With this proposal, I hope to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture that are critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits.",
