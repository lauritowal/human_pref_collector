        "The proposed research aims to investigate the impact of acute stress on large-scale neural networks and cognitive functioning. By utilizing advanced network connectivity modeling and wearable biosensors, the study seeks to identify neural markers that predict resilience to stress in real-life situations. The research will be cross-validated in a patient group with high stress sensitivity to further understand the relationship between network dynamics and stress response. Additionally, the study will explore the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems in generating rapid network shifts during acute stress. By testing the hypothesis that cognitive functions can be disrupted by shifts in network balance, the project will provide valuable insight into how the brain adapts to stress. Furthermore, the development of a network-based functional MRI neurofeedback training protocol aims to help stress-sensitive individuals adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. Ultimately, the research project seeks to uncover novel transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience and sensitivity, as well as potentially groundbreaking methods for training stress resilience."

Repeated exposure to stressors is furthermore a critical transdiagnostic factor in etiology, relapse, and chronification in almost all psychiatric disorders. We know from animal work at the cellular level how stressors trigger a neurochemical cascade that alters properties of widespread neuronal populations. A critical gap in our knowledge, however, is how such cellular effects translate to the level of large-scale neural systems which implement higher-order cognition. Here, I propose a novel framework for understanding such alterations as shifts in network balance: I hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at the level of large-scale networks. First, I will leverage recent advances in network connectivity modeling to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of such shifts during acute stress and recovery. Using wearable biosensors and mobile applications, I aim to identify which neural markers predict resilience to stress in real life. Second, I will cross-validate these markers in a patient group characterized by high stress sensitivity. Third, to investigate how rapid network shifts are generated, I will examine the distinct roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems. Fourth, I will test the hypothesis that cognitive functions supported by one network can be disrupted by shifting balance towards another. Finally, I will develop a network-based implementation of functional MRI neurofeedback to train stress-sensitive participants to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. When successful, this project will yield 1) unprecedented insight into how our brain adapts to acute stress; 2) novel ecologically validated transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience versus sensitivity; and 3) a potentially groundbreaking method for training stress resilience.",
