        "The proposed VARIKIN project aims to explore the cultural evolutionary origins of kinship diversity in human societies. By integrating cultural phylogenetics, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development, the project seeks to answer fundamental questions regarding the classification of kin within different cultures. VARIKIN-Evolution will investigate how and why kinship diversity evolves across cultures and over time, utilizing comparative phylogenetic modeling to analyze the dynamics of kinship terminologies and family norms in eight language families. VARIKIN-Usage will explore how people use kinship language through corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews, aiming to quantify patterns of usage in spoken and written language and to understand how social norms drive changes in kinship terminology. Finally, VARIKIN-Development will examine how children acquire and understand kinship across cultures, utilizing participant observation and elicitation tasks to characterize children's social learning of kinship in a small-scale, non-Western community. By uniting these three research directions under a coherent framework, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the diversity in how societies classify their social worlds. The Applicant's multidisciplinary background uniquely positions them to lead this innovative and groundbreaking project, shedding light on the complex processes that shape kinship diversity in human societies."

Why are cousins classed with siblings in some societies but not others? Accounting for the variable ways that cultures classify kin is an enduring puzzle. The VARIKIN project takes a cultural evolutionary approach to variety and unity and engages different fields–cultural phylogenetics, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development. VARIKIN-Evolution asks how and why does kinship diversity evolve across cultures and over time? Using comparative phylogenetic modeling of cultural evolution we investigate the dynamics of how kinship terminologies and family norms change in eight language families. Are there “universal” patterns of change, or does local cultural history and context determine changes in family organisation? How do social norms drive change in kinship terminology? VARIKIN-Usage investigates how people use kinship language by using corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to quantify patterns of usage in spoken and written language. How frequently are kinship terms used in different contexts and what meanings are more prevalent? Do patterns vary between languages, and can the patterns of usage at the individual level be linked to historical processes of change? VARIKIN-Development investigates how children acquire and understand kinship across cultures. Using participant observation and elicitation tasks, we characterise children’s social learning of kinship in a small-scale, non-Western community. Are there cross-cultural patterns of acquisition? Can socialisation produce constraints on the kinds of kinship children can learn? These three research directions are united by a coherent framework for the integration of macro- and micro-evolutionary processes. With a highly multidisciplinary background, the Applicant is uniquely positioned to direct this vanguard project towards a comprehensive understanding of diversity in how we classify our social worlds.",
