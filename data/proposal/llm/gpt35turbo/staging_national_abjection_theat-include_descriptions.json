        "The proposed research project, titled \"Staging National Abjection,\" aims to investigate the role of theatre in the processes of national abjection and the negotiation of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas. By utilizing a transdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approach, the project will explore how theatre has historically contributed to the construction of the Turkish nation and the marginalization of minority groups. Through a comprehensive analysis of theatre productions involving Armenians, queer communities, Islamic groups, Sephardic Jews, and Alevis, the study will shed light on the complex dynamics of national identity and exclusion in Turkey and beyond. By examining both mainstream and alternative sources, as well as conducting ethnographic research, the project will expand our understanding of the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government. The findings of this research will not only contribute to scholarship on Turkish theatre and cultural politics but also offer valuable insights into the broader issues of diasporic theatre, refugee experiences, and the performance of citizenship in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies. Ultimately, this project seeks to uncover the intricate connections between artistic expression, national identity, and citizenship in the nation-state, offering a critical perspective on the complexities of belonging and exclusion in contemporary societies."

This research will analyse how theatre has served the processes of national abjection, and how abjected minorities have used theatre to negotiate the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas. Employing a rigorous transdisciplinary theoretical and methodological framework, the project will study the key role theatre has played in the constitution of “the Turkish nation” and its Others. Staging National Abjection covers the period from the rise of European-style theatre in the Ottoman Empire in the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Using both mainstream and alternative archives and ethnographic research methods, the project will investigate topics of vital importance that have received limited academic attention: theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide; negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas; Islamic theatre in Turkey and its European diasporas; Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe; and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. These case studies will bring different perspectives to the issue of national abjection, and provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre responding to pressures of a conservative neoliberal government. Using the case of Turkey as a vantage point, this project will ask critical questions of broader theoretical significance about the role of theatre in regulating the politics of belonging in the nation-state, and about the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. This research will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, advance our understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and provide ground-breaking insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.",
