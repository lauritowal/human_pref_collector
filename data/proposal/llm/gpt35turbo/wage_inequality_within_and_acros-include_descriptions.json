    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of wage inequality in industrialised countries, with a focus on the role of firms in exacerbating or ameliorating this disparity. The research aims to investigate the market forces driving wage gaps between firms, the impact of government policies on wage structures, and the influence of firm policies and environments on gender inequality. Utilizing extensive German social security records spanning four decades, supplemented by survey and administrative data on firms, the project will consist of three main components. \n\nProject A will explore how product market competition and technological advancements have contributed to increasing wage inequality between firms through selection, reallocation, and differential wage growth effects. Project B will examine the effects of government policies, such as minimum wage laws and changes in business tax rates, on wage dispersion between firms. Finally, Project C will assess the effectiveness of firm-provided family-friendly policies in reducing gender inequality, as well as investigate how the presence of co-workers with egalitarian gender attitudes influences mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth. By focusing on firm-level factors in understanding wage and gender disparities, this research has the potential to inform policy interventions aimed at promoting greater equity in the workforce."

Furthermore, substantial inequality between men and women persists in all industrialised countries, and a large part of the gender gaps observed today is attributable to the arrival of children. In this proposal, we put firms at the centre of the analysis and ask the following questions: First, which market forces can (partly) explain the increasing wage inequality between firms? Second, how do government policies alter the wage structure? And third, how do firm policies and the firm environment impact on gender inequality? All projects draw on four decades of German social security records comprising the near universe of workers and establishments, which we augment with survey and administrative data on firms. In Project A, we investigate how two important market forces, increased product market competition and routine-biased technological change, contributed to the increasing wage inequality between firms, by changing which firms operate in the market (selection) and how employment is distributed across low and high productivity firms (reallocation), and by differentially affecting wage growth across firm types (differential wage growth). In Project B, we study how two prominent government policies, the introduction of a minimum wage and changes in business tax rates, affect wage dispersion between firms through selection, reallocation and differential growth effects. In Project C, we first analyse whether firm provided family-friendly policies, most notably flexible working times and child care facilities, can be effective at reducing gender inequality. We then investigate how the firm environment, specifically the presence of co-workers who are likely to have a working mother and hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, shapes mothersâ€™ return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.",
