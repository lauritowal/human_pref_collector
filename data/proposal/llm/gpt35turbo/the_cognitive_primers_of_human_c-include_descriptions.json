        "The proposed project, PRIMERS, aims to investigate the conditions driving innovations across primates in order to shed light on the development of unique human culture. The focus will be on the emergence of intentional stone tool flaking, a behavior that represents a significant milestone in human technological evolution. By utilizing a systematic and holistic approach, PRIMERS will examine the stone manipulation propensities of wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques through innovative artificial intelligence coding methods. The project will also investigate the effects of exposure and experience on innovation by conducting large-scale experiments with these primate species over a period of approximately four years.\n\nThrough the comparison of primate tool assemblages with some of the oldest human stone tools, PRIMERS aims to infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. By utilizing Structural Equation Models, the project will determine the relative contributions and interactions between various factors influencing the development of innovative behaviors. Overall, PRIMERS seeks to enhance our understanding of the conditions necessary for innovation across primates, providing valuable insights into the origins of human culture."

By identifying the conditions driving innovations across primates, we can provide new insight into when and how humans developed this unique culture. PRIMERS will address this need by adopting a systematic and holistic approach to testing the catalysts of a watershed behaviour in our evolutionary history: the ability to make and use sharp stone tools (flakes). The advent of intentional flakes in the human lineage marks the first clear divergence between animal and human technology. With tools to access high-value calories, our ancestors now had the physical and cognitive resources to lay the groundwork for our culture. PRIMERS will use a triangulation approach to follow the emergence of flaking in appropriate proxy models: wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. Objective 1 will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of these species using novel artificial intelligence coding methods. Objective 2 will test two other major drivers of innovations: exposure and experience. An experimental paradigm with in-built controls, large sample sizes (N =350), and long-term testing protocols (approx. 4 years) will be used to empirically evaluate the cognitive and developmental primers of innovations. Objective 3 will systematically compare primate assemblages to some of the oldest human stone tools, allowing for inferences to be made on when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Structural Equation Models will then determine the relative contributions and interactions between the measured factors. By testing three species, combining and upscaling experimental paradigms and implementing powerful modelling tools, PRIMERS will radically enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations, and with it, the primers of human culture.",
