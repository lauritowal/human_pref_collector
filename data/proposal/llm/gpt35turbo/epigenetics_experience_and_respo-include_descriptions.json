        "The NEUROEPIGENETHICS grant proposal aims to explore the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Building upon the existing research on the interplay between genetics, environment, and neurodevelopment, this project seeks to investigate how epigenetic factors influence the conception of responsibility among individuals with these conditions and their families. By utilizing theoretical and empirical methods, we will analyze how concepts such as innate/biological/genetic impact the understanding of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Through interviews and surveys, we will examine how individuals with ASD, TS, and ADHD, as well as their families, perceive the interaction between their condition and their biological and social environment. Ultimately, this research will contribute to defining moral responsibility in the field of child psychiatric practice, taking into account the complexities introduced by the emerging field of epigenetics. The findings from this study have the potential to inform ethical decision-making and improve the support and care provided to individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders."

The conceptualization of psychiatric conditions as innate or acquired, biological or psychosocial, genetic or environmental, influences the ascription of both capacity responsibility (the capacity to adapt or adjust oneâ€™s own behavior) and normative responsibility of individuals or the society towards those diagnosed. But findings in the field of epigenetics indicate that the social and physical environment influence how genes are expressed. Indeed, epigenetics may shed a new light on distinctions such as innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, biological/psychosocial: a far more complex view on neurodevelopmental disorders may emerge, with ethical implications. However, the implications of epigenetics for discussions on the scope and extent of normative responsibility have not been adequately addressed. NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to investigate the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders. We will use theoretical and empirical methods to investigate how certain concepts (innate/biological/genetic) affect the ways in which professionals and stakeholders (persons with a neurodevelopmental disorder and their families) conceive of responsibility. We will evaluate how the emerging field of epigenetics alters the ascription of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility. We will research how individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)and their families experience the interaction between their condition and their biological and social environment. Finally, we will define moral responsibility in light of the emerging field of epigenetics in the area of neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychiatric practice.",
