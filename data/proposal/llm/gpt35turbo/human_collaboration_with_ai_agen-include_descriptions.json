        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a multi-sited ethnographic study on the emerging trend of big data/AI-informed national health governance. The project aims to investigate the ethical implications and societal impacts of the integration of AI systems in health policy decision-making processes. Drawing on existing literature that highlights the potential biases and discriminatory outcomes of AI algorithms, this research will focus on the human-agent interactions within organizations that utilize AI in health governance. By examining decisive moments when data analysts either follow or deviate from AI recommendations, the study seeks to understand the factors influencing ethical decision-making in various national settings with different governmental frameworks. \n\nUsing innovative anthropological methods, the research will explore future scenarios in the intersection of AI and national health policies, contributing to the development of a theory on the contextual and organizational factors shaping ethical AI practices. By collaborating with AI developers, health decision-makers, and policy institutions, the project aims to bridge the gap between anthropological insights and technological expertise, ultimately contributing to the promotion of fair and ethical AI in global health systems. This research will not only enhance our understanding of the socio-cultural context of AI integration but also provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the field of health governance."

With health data being considered countries’ ‘future oil’, public and scholarly concerns about ‘algorithmic ethics’ rise. Research has long shown that datasets in AI (re)produce social biases, discriminate and limit personal autonomy. This literature, however, has merely focused on AI design and institutional frameworks, examining the subject through legal, technocratic and philosophical perspectives, whilst overlooking the socio-cultural context in which big data and AI systems are embedded, most particularly organizations in which human agents collaborate with AI. This is problematic, as frameworks for ‘ethical AI’ currently consider human oversight crucial, assuming that humans will correct or resist AI when needed; while empirical evidence for this assumption is extremely thin. Very little is known about when and why people intervene or resist AI. Research done consists of single, mostly Western studies, making it impossible to generalize findings. The innovative force of our research is fourfold: 1) To empirically analyze decisive moments in which data-analysts follow or deviate AI: moments deeply impacting national health policies and individual human lives. 2) To do research in six national settings with various governmental frameworks and in different organizational contexts, enabling us to contrast findings, eventually leading to a theory on the contextual, organizational factors underlying ethical AI. 3) To use innovative anthropological methods of future-scenarioing, which will enrich the anthropological discipline by developing and finetuning future-focused research. 4) The research connects anthropological insights with the expertise of AI-developers, and partners with relevant health decisionmakers and policy-institutions, allowing to both analyze and contribute to fair AI.",
