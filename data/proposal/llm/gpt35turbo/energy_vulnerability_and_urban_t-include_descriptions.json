        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project aimed at addressing the issue of domestic energy poverty in urban households in post-socialist states of Eastern and Central Europe (ECE). The project will take a comprehensive approach to investigating the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the context of the post-socialist city. By utilizing an energy vulnerability framework, the project will explore the causes, character, and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE, with a focus on the urban districts of Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will examine how institutional structures, built environments, and everyday practices contribute to urban energy vulnerability. The ultimate goal of the project is to generate knowledge that can inform the development of technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean, and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, with the potential to aid in climate change mitigation efforts. This project represents a critical step towards addressing the complex challenges faced by millions of urban households in ECE who struggle to afford heating their homes during the winter months."

The limited body of scholarship and policy tends to conceptualize domestic energy deprivation in ECE through the narrow lens of incomes and energy efficiency. The purpose of this project is to radically transform the state of the art in the field by undertaking the first comprehensive investigation of the multiple social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the grain of the post-socialist city. The project will use an energy vulnerability framework to explore the causes, character and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE. Energy vulnerability can be seen as the propensity of a household to experience a lack of socially- and materially-necessitated energy services in the home. EvalUaTE will investigate the manner in which institutional structures, built tissues and everyday practices shape urban energy vulnerability. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will achieve its aims by undertaking a comparative study of eight urban districts within Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia). The knowledge gained from the project can potentially lead to the improvement of existing, or establishment of new, technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, ultimately aiding climate change mitigation.",
