        "The LABFLEX project aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization and technological change. This project is motivated by the increasing prevalence of alternative work arrangements, such as outsourcing and flexible scheduling, which have contributed to rising wage inequality in recent decades. Through a combination of register data, experimental evidence on worker preferences, and information on job attributes, LABFLEX will explore whether differences in job contracts reflect shifts in worker preferences or advances in technology. Additionally, the project will examine the impacts of job contract flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps, as well as the role of labor market institutions and policies in shaping flexibility. By linking various data sources and employing experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide a detailed picture of both the supply and demand side of the labor market, shedding light on the mechanisms driving changes in job contracts. Ultimately, this research will offer new insights into the dynamics of labor market flexibility and its implications for the distribution of resources in society."

At the core of these major developments is the degree of flexibility in the labor market. Alternative work arrangements, e.g., outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs have become a common feature of labor markets across the globe. While most economists would argue that labor market flexibility facilitates reaping the benefits of globalization and technology growth, these developments can have far reaching consequences for the division of resources in society. Indeed, the recent decades have witnessed a sharp rise in wage inequality. LABFLEX is motivated by these developments and seeks to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. LABFLEX raises a series of questions: Do differences in job contracts reflect shifts in worker preferences, or do they mirror advances in technology that facilitate gains from organizing job tasks differently? What are the impacts of flexibility in job contracts on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers being compensated for the adverse work conditions or the higher income risks, or do changes in job contracts reflect changes in the sharing of rents between workers and firms? How do labor market institutions affect flexibility? And what is the role of labor market policies? To answer these questions, LABFLEX will for the first-time link register data to large-scale experimental evidence on workersâ€™ stated preferences for a wide array of work and pay arrangements, and an exhaustive full-text corpus of vacancies with information on job attributes. This will allow drawing a very detailed picture of both the supply and the demand side of the labor market, facilitating a study of flexibility in job contracts. Combining these data with experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility.",
