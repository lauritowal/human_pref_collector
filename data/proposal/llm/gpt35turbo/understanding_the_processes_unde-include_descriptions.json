        "This grant proposal seeks to address the challenges faced by social scientists studying relationships between constructs such as beliefs and values, particularly in the context of polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination. The proposed research will focus on utilizing large-scale survey data to investigate the impact of values on climate change beliefs, the role of perceived threats in predicting political beliefs, and how risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation influence vaccine hesitancy. \n\nThe project aims to overcome three key challenges in this area of research. Firstly, the proposal seeks to address the issue of measurement error in survey items used to capture unobservable constructs, which can lead to underestimated effects and misguided conclusions. Secondly, the research will explore the variation in underlying processes across different groups, such as countries in the European Social Survey, to understand how drivers of beliefs may differ based on group characteristics. Finally, the project will tackle the problem of non-invariance in construct measurement due to factors like translation, which can impact the comparison of effects among constructs.\n\nBy developing a mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework that accounts for these challenges, the proposed research aims to provide a deeper understanding of the drivers behind polarized beliefs. The project will implement these methods in freely available software and utilize clustering techniques to identify common processes within subsets of groups. Ultimately, this research has the potential to break new ground in understanding the factors that shape beliefs and values in society."

For example, do values affect climate change beliefs? Do perceived threats predict political beliefs? Do risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation determine vaccine hesitancy? Polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination are a societal threat and it is important to study what drives them. Large-scale survey data is gathered to do so. Using regression to answer the questions ignores that constructs are not directly observable, but measured by survey items containing measurement error (challenge 1). Not correcting for this causes the studied effects to be underestimated and conclusions to be misguided. When many groups are involved - such as many countries in the European Social Survey - the underlying processes likely differ across groups. For example, drivers of climate change beliefs may differ for countries experiencing extreme weather. Group-specific or multilevel analyses result in numerous group-specific regression slopes or random effects, making it hard to find which regression effects are different or similar for which groups (challenge 2). Across many groups, the constructs' measurement is often inequivalent or 'non-invariant', for example, due to translation (challenge 3). A measurement model indicates how items measure a construct and disregarding non-invariance in this model invalidates the comparison of effects among constructs (i.e., one may find differences that are actually due to non-invariance). By tackling challenges 1-3, the proposed mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework provides the tools to break new ground in understanding what drives constructs like polarized beliefs. A clustering finds subsets of groups with common processes. Flexible measurement models account for non-invariance so that the clustering focuses on the processes. I will implement the methods in freely available software.",
