        "This grant proposal seeks to address the critical gap in research regarding the psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on transgender individuals, a population facing disproportionately high rates of social disruption and suicide risk. Drawing on insights from social neuroendocrinology, social psychology, and epidemiology, we aim to develop a comprehensive biopsychosocial model that elucidates the impact of hormone therapy on psychosocial functioning and social relationship experiences in transgender individuals. Our interdisciplinary approach will involve four interconnected work packages that utilize cutting-edge research methods to achieve three key aims: identifying causal pathways between hormone therapy and psychosocial functioning, amplifying the voices of transgender individuals in sharing their personal experiences, and informing policy and practice in gender identity services to prioritize improved psychosocial outcomes.\n\nBy combining biological, psychological, and sociocultural perspectives, this research program will contribute to advancing gender-affirming healthcare and treatment for transgender individuals, ultimately promoting health equity and well-being within this marginalized population. The proposed study is positioned to make significant contributions to the field by providing evidence-based insights that can guide clinical practice, policy development, and social support initiatives for transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy."

A crucial oversight in this area is that very little research has examined how gender-affirming hormone therapy, the most common form of medical intervention for transgender people, shapes psychosocial functioning and ultimately social relationship experiences. Given the paramount importance of social relationships to health and well-being, evidence for psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy is vital to ensuring health equity for transgender people, who suffer from alarmingly high rates of social disruption and suicide risk. I draw together independent strands of research on biological effects of hormones from social neuroendocrinology and health influences of psychological and sociocultural factors from social psychology and epidemiology to propose a novel biopsychosocial model linking gender-affirming hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning in transgender people. Drawing upon this model, I propose a programme of research involving four complementary work packages, triangulating across a variety of novel and cutting-edge research methods. This work will be guided by three key aims: A) to isolate causal pathways from a biopsychosocial model linking gender-affirming hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning, B) to empower transgender people to give voice to their own personal and relational experiences in the context of gender-affirming hormone therapy, and, C) to guide policy and practice for gender identity services in line with the informed consent model, directing focus to the improvement of psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes. This interdisciplinary programme of research will sit at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare and treatment for transgender people.",
