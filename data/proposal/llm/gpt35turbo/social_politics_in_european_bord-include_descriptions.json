        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of local actors in shaping welfare systems in three European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. By focusing on the interactions between families, associations, and public institutions from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project aims to shed light on the co-construction of welfare in regions where central state influence was fluctuating. The project will explore the development of overlapping and sometimes competing structures of social provision based on national and non-national forms of identity and solidarity, such as occupation or religion.\n\nThrough intensive local studies in a comparative and transnational framework, the project will analyze the similarities and differences between north-western, eastern, and south-eastern borderlands. By tracing the circulation of ideas, people, and practices, the project aims to provide insight into the historical development of welfare systems in Europe and contribute to contemporary debates on welfare reform. The research will focus on the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that have historically shaped welfare provision in Europe, with the goal of informing current discussions on social rights and welfare policies."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",
