        "The objective of the proposed project, BIGlobal, is to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power in order to gain new insights into welfare and policy in the context of a globalized economy. While much of the current analysis of the global economy operates under the assumption that markets efficiently allocate resources with little need for policy intervention, it is clear that big firms play a significant role in economic activity, especially across borders. This project aims to investigate how firm decisions impact the overall gains from globalization, the distribution of these gains among different individuals, and the implications for policy development. \n\nOver the course of the next five years, the research will focus on incorporating more nuanced firm behavior into models of international trade to understand the ways in which trade and industrial policies influence the growth process, particularly in less developed markets. Key questions to be addressed include how trade and competition policies can ensure that consumers benefit from globalization in the presence of firms with market power, the impact of domestic policies on the ability of small farmers to benefit from trade, the influence of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages, and the effects of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector. By combining theoretical analysis with data from developing economies, this project aims to advance knowledge on trade and industrial policy and provide a foundation for evidence-based policymaking."

The objective of my future research is to provide such an analysis. BIGlobal will examine the sources of firm growth and market power to provide new insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Much of analysis of the global economy is set in the paradigm of markets that allocate resources efficiently and there is little role for policy. But big firms dominate economic activity, especially across borders. How do firms grow and what is the effect of their market power on the welfare impact of globalization? This project will determine how firm decisions matter for the aggregate gains from globalization, the division of these gains across different individuals and their implications for policy design. Over the next five years, I will incorporate richer firms behaviour in models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact the growth process, especially in less developed markets. The specific questions I will address include: how can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms engaged in international trade have market power, how do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect the extent to which small farmers gain from trade, how do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages, and what is the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector. Each project will combine theoretical work with rich data from developing economies to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and to provide a basis for informed policymaking.",
