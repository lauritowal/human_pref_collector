        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying consciousness by comparing the neuronal activity associated with simple and complex visual stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across various brain regions. Building on previous research that demonstrated the role of the frontal cortex in storing stimuli in working memory, this project will utilize single neuron recordings in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and in monkeys with electrodes implanted in an entire hemisphere. By characterizing neuronal activity in multiple regions of the cortex and subcortex, as well as utilizing perturbation methods and functional imaging, this study will create a \"functional connectome\" to identify the brain regions crucial for conscious perception. The results of this research will provide unprecedented insight into the interplay between sensory stimuli, attention, and working memory in the emergence of conscious perception. Ultimately, this project seeks to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness and pave the way for new paradigms in assessing awareness of stimuli."

Why are some visual stimuli consciously perceived, whereas others remain subliminal? What is the relation between conscious perception, attention and working memory? Recent work of my lab demonstrated that weak but simple stimuli can be reported once they elicit a minimal level of activity in the frontal cortex, which is related to the storage of the stimulus in working memory. For these simple stimuli, the visual cortex acts as a relay station that needs to pass the information to higher cortical areas. However, we found that the perception of more complex visual stimuli relies on a more sustained interaction between visual cortex and associative brain regions, related to scene segmentation and visual attention. These recent results pave the way for a genuine understanding of mechanisms for consciousness, inspiring new paradigms that assess the awareness of stimuli while varying the demands on attention and working memory. The present proposal will be the first to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across most brain regions. We will measure the activity of single neurons in human patients who are implanted with electrodes as part of their treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We will also use a new method that permits the recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will use perturbation methods at numerous locations throughout the brain in combination with functional imaging in monkeys to measure a “functional connectome” and to investigate the brain regions in which activity does (or does not) readily lead to a reportable experience. The proposed combination of experiments will provide unprecedented insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception.",
