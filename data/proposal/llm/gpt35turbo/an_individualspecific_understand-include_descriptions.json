        "The proposed research project, SynSig, aims to investigate the role of individual-specific interpersonal synchrony in curative relationships, specifically focusing on the therapeutic relationship between clients and therapists. Building on the existing literature, SynSig challenges the one-size-fits-all approach to synchrony by suggesting that individuals have their own trait-like synchrony signature that influences the effectiveness of interactions. The project will use multimodal markers to analyze the synchrony signature and deviations from it in dyadic interactions with both humans and virtual humans. \n\nThrough the development of a feedback system that guides individual-tailored changes in synchrony, SynSig will explore how correcting deviations from the synchrony signature can transform relationships into curative ones. By drawing causal inferences between changes in synchrony and mental health outcomes, this research aims to provide new insights into the individual-specific nature of synchrony and its impact on mental health. Ultimately, the findings from this project will contribute to a better understanding of how human connections influence mental health, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic interventions in the future."

But how such interactions affect mental health is poorly understood. SynSig suggests that interpersonal synchrony is an individual-specific mechanism underlying curative relationships. It seeks to go beyond the one-size-fits-all “the higher the synchrony the better” theoretical assumption underlying the state of the art research. It is the first to propose that individuals have their own individual-specific trait-like synchrony signature as manifests across interacting partners. It further proposes that to make interactions curative, it is necessary to induce an individual-tailored correction to such a signature. That is, the amount and direction of the changes in synchrony must be guided by the individual’s synchrony signature. To develop an individual-specific understanding of synchrony, SynSig focuses on curative interactions encapsulated in time and space: the therapeutic relationship between the client and therapist. It will investigate the existence of individual-specific synchrony signature and how individual-tailored correction of the signature serves as the mechanism transforming relationships into curative ones. It will implement multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) for disentangling the trait-like synchrony signature and state-like deviations from it, of individuals participating in multiple dyadic interactions with humans and virtual humans. The first multimodal feedback system on momentary deviations from the signature will be developed and used to facilitate individual-tailored changes in synchrony and draw causal inferences between such changes and mental health outcomes. The findings will provide new insights into the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and bring us closer to understanding how human connections affect our mental health.",
