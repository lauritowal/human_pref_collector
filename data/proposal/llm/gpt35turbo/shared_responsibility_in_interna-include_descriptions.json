        "The proposed project seeks to address the complex issue of shared international responsibilities in cases of cooperation among multiple actors to achieve common objectives such as environmental protection and prevention of mass atrocities. Existing frameworks based on individual responsibility are inadequate when responsibilities are shared among numerous actors, leading to a scattering of accountability that undermines the international rule of law and hampers the provision of remedies to affected parties. This project, named SHARES, aims to uncover the extent and nature of this problem and provide new perspectives on how to align cooperation with a system of international responsibility. \n\nThrough a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical case studies, SHARES will explore the possibility of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible for shared international responsibilities. The project will also investigate how (quasi-)judicial processes can better consider the collective context of international policies when assigning responsibility. By delving into both principles and processes of international responsibility, SHARES will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by shared responsibilities in the context of international cooperation."

International cooperation may complicate attempts to determine who is responsible for what. SHARES is based on the unrecognized and unexplored fact that as the responsibility for policies is shared among more actors, the discrete responsibility of every individual actor is diminished proportionately. International cooperation paradoxically may undermine the key objectives of any scheme of responsibility : the protection of the international rule of law and the provision of remedies of injured parties. The dominant principle of individual responsibility, and the scholarship based on it, provides us neither with the concepts nor the perspectives for addressing shared responsibilities. SHARES will uncover the extent and nature of the problem of scattering of international responsibilities in cases of international cooperation and will provide fresh perspectives on how cooperation can be better matched by a corresponding system of international responsibility. It will pursue two interlocking tracks, focussing on principles and processes of international responsibility. As to principles, it will examine the possibility of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly or proportionately responsible. As to processes, SHARES will rethink how (quasi-)judicial processes may better taken into account the collective context of the international policies of states and other actors. SHARES will complement a conceptual and theoretical foundation with a thorough empirical approach, exploring through case-studies how we can improve our understanding of the principles and processes that are needed to match the unprecedented international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility.",
