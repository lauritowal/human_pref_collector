        "The proposed project, titled LostInZoom, aims to address the current lack of guidelines for designing smooth and seamless zoom interactions in multi-scale interactive maps. With the widespread use of platforms like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap, traditional rules for designing paper topographic maps are no longer applicable. As a result, users often feel disoriented and lost during zooming interactions. \n\nLostInZoom seeks to establish a new zooming paradigm for multi-scale maps by introducing the concept of multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during zooming. Through a combination of cognitive experiments, cartographic generalization techniques, and the design of new zooming interactions, this project will investigate how users perceive and understand interactive multi-scale maps. By identifying key landmarks that aid in navigation during zooming, the project aims to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for map exploration. \n\nThe research conducted in this project will not only contribute to the field of cartography but also have practical implications for crisis management and other applications that rely on multi-scale maps. Ultimately, LostInZoom seeks to enhance the usability and effectiveness of multi-scale interactive maps for a wide range of users."

Past research told us how to design paper topographic maps at a given scale to make them readable and understandable by human users. But these rules/guidelines do not apply anymore, and map designers lack guidelines to make maps that are smooth to explore through scales, and it is common for a multi-scale map user to feel lost for a few seconds after a zooming interaction. The LostInZoom project (Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management) seeks to establish a new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps, based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during the zoom. To achieve this novel zooming paradigm, we need new grounding knowledge on how people perceive and understand interactive multi-scale maps, in order to design maps and interaction that make multi-scale explorations smoother. The LostInZoom project will be based on three main pillars. In the first one, we will explore the cognition of multi-scale interactive maps with an experimentation approach, in order to identify the anchors or landmarks that help a map reader locate himself when zooming. In the second pillar, we will design new cartographic generalisation techniques to derive multi-scale maps that magnify the landmarks that are important for multi-scale exploration. Finally, the third pillar will be dedicated to the design of new zooming interactions that focus on these landmarks to smooth even more the zooming exploration.",
