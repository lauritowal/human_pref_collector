        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the success and failure of digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, focusing on improving efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery. With an estimated 5.7 million deaths annually due to limited access to essential public services in low-income countries, there is an urgent need to understand how digital technologies can be effectively harnessed to address this issue. \n\nThrough collaboration with local governments and NGOs, four large-scale randomized experiments will be conducted in countries where public services are being digitized, including India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. These experiments will explore how digital technologies can influence both the demand for public services by enabling citizens to access them digitally, as well as the supply of in-person services by remotely monitoring or supervising delivery agents. \n\nBy shedding light on the determinants of successful digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, this research aims to inform public policy and contribute to more robust and inclusive economic growth. Ultimately, the findings of this study will help a larger segment of the population in low-income countries access higher quality public services, potentially reducing the number of deaths and individuals pushed into extreme poverty due to limited access to essential public services."

Governments across the globe have responded by adopting digital technologies — e.g., by making services available to citizens virtually — in the hopes of providing broader, faster, and cheaper access to public services. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in this regard, low-income countries continue to struggle with nearly one-third of digitalization projects being abandoned and substantial resources being wasted (World Development Report, 2016). Moreover, even when successful, these digitization projects they risk excluding vulnerable individuals with limited connectivity, potentially widening existing inequalities. This research proposal aims to advance our understanding of (i) the determinants of the success or failure of digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, and (ii) the ways digital technologies can be harnessed to improve the efficiency and inclusion of public service delivery, thereby producing more robust and inclusive economic growth. In collaboration with local governments and NGOs, I will design and carry out four large-scale randomized experiments in countries where public services are being digitized (India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Liberia). In these experiments, I will study digital technologies that influence (i) the demand for public services by allowing citizens to access them digitally, and (ii) the supply of in-person services by remotely monitoring or supervising the delivery agents. The results will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately helping a broader segment of the population access more and higher quality public services.",
