        "This grant proposal seeks to address the critical relationship between nature and economic decision-making in the management of renewable resources. The project will focus on understanding how natural constraints influence the preferences and incentives of economic agents, ultimately shaping the management of common-pool resources. By investigating the mechanisms through which nature impacts cooperation and resource management, this research aims to contribute to the development of effective policies for sustainable resource use. The project will explore three key aspects: (A) the role of tipping points in encouraging cooperation, (B) the impact of resource abundance volatility on risk preferences and community-based management, and (C) the interaction between leadership, risk preferences, and the natural environment in fostering cooperation to address common-pool dilemmas. By combining theoretical and statistical analysis with case studies from different socio-economic and ecological settings across three continents, this project will push the frontier of economics and sustainability science. The researcher's background in economics and ecology uniquely positions them to undertake this ambitious research agenda. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify conditions under which natural factors and social dynamics can work together to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources."

This can be taken into account to formulate effective policies. However, the causal pathway from the natural to the social environment and its feedback for sustainable resource use is often overlooked, not the least because preferences and incentives are traditionally viewed as being stable and fixed. Yet, it is high time to take this new perspective: Social-ecological systems around the globe are under mounting stress and common pool resources are vital, in particular in developing countries. This project aims to establish how nature shapes preferences and incentives of economic agents and how this in turn affects common-pool resource management. To this end, I investigate three mechanisms: (A) how tipping points and thresholds in the natural system may encourage cooperation; (B) how the volatility of resource abundance influences risk preferences and how this in turn affects community-based management; and (C) how leadership, which is closely linked to risk preferences, interacts with the natural environment to foster cooperation that overcomes common-pool dilemmas. NATCOOP's bold agenda pushes the frontier of economics and sustainability science. Not only the investigation of the feedbacks between nature and cooperation from a new angle, also the scale and scope of the project -- combining cases from different socio-economic and ecological setting at three continents with theoretical and statistical work -- will generate new knowledge and be highly rewarding. Though challenging, I am confident that my background in economics and ecology puts me in an ideal position to achieve this important task. My ultimate goal is to identify circumstances in which natural preconditions and the social setting may go hand in hand to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources.",
