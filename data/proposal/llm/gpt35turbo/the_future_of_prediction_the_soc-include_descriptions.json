        "This grant proposal seeks to address the transformative impact of the algorithmic turn of prediction in the context of Big Data and Machine Learning on the social sciences. While recent advancements in digital forecasting offer the promise of predictive accuracy for individuals and events, the implications of this shift from probabilistic uncertainty management to algorithmic prediction remain largely unexplored. Building on existing literature, this project aims to conduct theory-driven empirical research in three key social areas: personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing. By examining the challenges of individualization, generalization, and bias in these domains, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of the social, technical, and theoretical dimensions of prediction in the digital age. Through this research, the project intends to shed light on the potential consequences of this transformation for society, including the impact on established practices such as actuarial principles, statistical methods, and the distinction between prevention and repression in policing. By filling this gap in current research, this project will contribute valuable insights to the social sciences and facilitate a deeper understanding of the implications of the algorithmic turn of prediction for the future."

Recent advances in digital forecasting claim to provide a predictive score for individual persons or singular events, thereby introducing a new way to manage the uncertainty of the future. But knowing the future in advance is not only advantageous. In fact, for our society, uncertainty about the future is also a resource. Since modernity, with the support of probability calculus various social institutions in different domains have developed means of coping with ignorance of the future by starting with the one thing that we all share – uncertainty. What happens to the stabilized forms of management of the future when their first resource – shared uncertainty – is missing? There is still no systematic research on this groundbreaking transformation. This project proposes a set of theory-driven empirical studies of the transition from probabilistic forms of uncertainty management to the new algorithmic forms of prediction. We will investigate three important social areas highlighting three fundamental dimensions with which digital forecast must deal. 1) First we will focus on personalized insurance. Here the key dimension is individualization of prediction, where the challenge is that such prediction could undermine the mutualization principle organized around actuarial practices. 2) Our second research area is precision medicine, highlighting the dimension of generalization where the challenge is the combination of algorithmic procedures with established statistical methods. 3) In the third field, predictive policing underscores the problem of bias while it challenges the distinction between prevention and repression. Exploring these transformation and its consequences, the project aims at developing a comprehensive approach to study the social, technical and theoretical aspects of prediction in digital society",
