        "The proposed project aims to develop a serious game, A.L.I.B.I., to support children in successfully transitioning to high school by enhancing their self-regulation skills and promoting prosocial behavior. Poor social experiences during elementary school have been found to negatively impact children's ability to regulate themselves and manage stress, putting them at risk for further challenges in high school. A.L.I.B.I. will immerse children in a virtual high school environment where they must uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer through engaging in prosocial interactions, considering multiple perspectives, and prioritizing long-term goals. By creating a safe yet realistic space for children to practice and learn these skills, A.L.I.B.I. aims to prepare them for the social challenges of high school. This project will focus on developing A.L.I.B.I. into a standalone game, evaluating its effectiveness, integrating it into existing school transition programs in three regions in The Netherlands, and developing a marketing strategy for broader implementation across Dutch and European schools. Through the innovative use of game elements and presentation on tablet devices, A.L.I.B.I. offers a unique approach to supporting children's social development and improving their transition to high school."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 286 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nOur ERC-team (ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay) has found that poor social experiences with peers (peer rejection, victimization) and teachers (low support or conflictual relations with teachers) during elementary school impede children’s self- and stress-regulation during the elementary school years. The affected self- and stress-regulation places these children at risk of developing similar troublesome relations with teachers and peers after the transition to high school. We propose to develop a serious game named A.L.I.B.I. to help children make a successful transition to high school by increasing children’s self-regulation skills and their prosocial behavior. In A.L.I.B.I. children play in a virtual high school environment. The objective of A.L.I.B.I. is to uncover an alien, who is disguised as a teacher or peer. By engaging in prosocial interactions with teachers and peers, by taking the perspective of others, by learning to overthink multiple response options before acting, and by valuing long term perspectives over short term goals, children will receive clues that will help them to uncover the alien. The advantage of A.L.I.B.I. is that through the use of a virtual school environment, it provides children a realistic yet safe environment to learn and rehearse prosocial behaviors, to prepare them for the new social environment. In addition, A.L.I.B.I. is intuitively attractive for children, through its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer. The proposed ERC PoC grant has the goal to (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game that will be ready for implementation, (2) to the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I., (3) to integrate A.L.I.B.I. in ongoing school transition trainings as provided by three school counseling organizations in three regions in The Netherlands, and (4) to develop a marketing strategy for broader Dutch and European implementation.",
