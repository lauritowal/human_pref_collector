        "The proposed project, titled \"Tracing Early Animal Management through Biogeochemical Analysis of Fossil Teeth (TEAMBIO),\" seeks to address the challenging task of detecting early evidences of sheep and goat management in the context of animal domestication. Through a high-resolution time analysis using biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, TEAMBIO aims to reconstruct the historical life-traits of these animals in order to identify key mechanisms that led to domestication. By focusing on the control of reproductive cycles, changes in feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements, the project will provide valuable insights into early caprine management practices.\n\nTEAMBIO will utilize data from the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent to compare and evaluate faunal assemblages from these key regions. By creating a reference dataset from wild relatives in museum collections and current living populations, the project aims to unravel unresolved paradigms surrounding the origin of animal domesticates. By shifting the focus from how the animals changed to what human societies did to change the animals, TEAMBIO seeks to shed light on when and where processes of animal domestication were initiated. Ultimately, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of early animal management practices and their role in the domestication process."

The earliest steps of this phenomenon are, still today, very difficult to achieve. Traditional zooarchaeological analyses used to date domestication rely on detecting the appearance of genetically-driven morphological changes in animals. These morphological markers, however, if they occur at all, only appear after the process is well underway, after hundreds, if not thousands, of years, making it difficult to study them. The READ project will build an alternative approach to detect early evidences of sheep and goat management. The project will investigate the historical life-traits of the animals with a high-resolution time analysis by performing biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth. Scientific approaches employed are not all highly innovative but their combination together with the themes addressed will involve a high-gain. This will allow reconstructing the three clue mechanisms that were pivotal in the lead up to domestication: the control of the animalsâ€™ reproductive cycles; the induced changes to their feeding habits; and the interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. The project will evaluate and compare data from what are known to be the three key regions for this research area: the Southern Levant, the Northern Levant and the Eastern Fertile Crescent. READ will analyses a set of the most important and significant available faunal assemblages for these regions and will put together a reference dataset from wild relatives available in museum collections and current living populations found in breeding centres. At the end of the project I will unravel the current unresolved paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates not relying on how the animals changed but rather what the human societies did to change the animals; revealing how early caprine management was done and where and when processes of animal domestication were initiated.",
