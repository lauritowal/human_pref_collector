        "This grant proposal aims to address the complex relationship between poverty eradication and climate change by developing a comprehensive body of knowledge that quantifies the energy needs and related climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all. Through a multidisciplinary approach that bridges global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, this project seeks to answer key questions such as what constitutes 'decent living standards', the energy resources required to provide these standards in different countries, and how the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop. By operationalizing basic needs views of human development, quantifying energy needs for decent living constituents, and analyzing path dependencies and trends in basic goods and energy intensity, this research will provide valuable insights into opportunities to shift developing societies towards low-carbon pathways. The ultimate goal is to help identify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation and support the efforts of emerging economies in eradicating poverty while mitigating climate change."

This is due to knowledge gaps related to the material basis of poverty, and the relationship between energy and human development. Addressing this issue rigorously requires bridging gaps between global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, and applying this knowledge to projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This project will develop a body of knowledge that quantifies the energy needs and related climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all. The research will address three questions: which goods and services, and with what characteristics, constitute ‘decent living standards’? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what impact will this energy use have on climate change? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? The first task will operationalize basic needs views of human development and advance their empirical validity by discerning characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. The second will quantify the energy needs (and climate-related emissions) for decent living constituents and reveal their dependence on culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions in countries. This will be done using lifecycle analysis and input-output analysis, and mapping energy to climate change using state-of-the-art energy-economy integrated assessment modelling tools for 5 emerging economies that face the challenges of eradicating poverty and mitigating climate change. The third task will shed light on path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity using empirical analysis. This research will identify opportunities to shift developing societies towards low-carbon pathways, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation.",
