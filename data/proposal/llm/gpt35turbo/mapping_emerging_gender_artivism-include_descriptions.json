        "The proposed project, \"Artivism for Gender Equality in the Mediterranean Arab Public Space (MEGAMAPS),\" seeks to conduct a comprehensive transnational study on the intersection of art, activism, and gender equality in the wake of the 2011 uprisings in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that combines History, Social Movements Theory, Gender Studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities, the project aims to shed light on the role of Artivism as a catalyst for social change and political transformation in the region.\n\nBy leveraging fieldwork, digital ethnography, and participative research methods, MEGAMAPS intends to create a groundbreaking digital platform that will document, analyze, and connect various forms of artistic expressions, oral histories, and maps related to Artivism for gender equality. This platform will not only contribute to the academic understanding of the Arab region but will also provide a valuable resource for activists, policymakers, and the general public.\n\nMoreover, the project seeks to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among artists, researchers, and civil society stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of promoting gender equality, arts, and democratic governance in the region. By challenging prevailing narratives of victimization and orientalism, MEGAMAPS aims to empower women and sexual minorities in the Arab region and offer a new perspective on their agency and contributions to social change."

By focusing on 4 countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia) the project aims to innovate the global academic knowledge on the Arab region by the writing of an unprecedented history from below which investigates the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent and social change. Based on fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS aims to frame, explore and map emerging Artivism for gender equality, conceived as a political incubator which revitalizes an egalitarian project of society in the post-2011 authoritarian ebb. In addition to academic publications, the project aims at producing the first open access and participative digital platform which will consistently document, systematize and interconnect a corpus of living sources (visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and cartographies, maps, graphic tools) and will: a) innovate the traditional approaches of History and Social Movements Theory on the Arab region; b) provide the first research platform dealing with Artivism, gender and social change in the Arab region; c) make this corpus FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders and to the general public. MEGAMAPS also involves a set of dissemination activities aimed to improve activistsâ€™ participation in a transnational network of artists, researchers, policy-makers and civil society stakeholders in order to promote mutual exchanges of best practices in the field of gender equality, arts and democratic governance, and to contribute in reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities in the Arab region by proposing an agency paradigm, which can also overcome orientalism and islamophobia within the Western public opinion.",
