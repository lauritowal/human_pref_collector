    "descriptions": [
        "This research project aims to further our understanding of the mechanisms and policies of innovation, and their impact on growth and social mobility. Building on the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, the study will utilize new firm-level and individual datasets to investigate key questions. These include the accuracy of productivity growth measurement and its reflection of new innovation, the causal relationship between innovation and trade, the effects of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, and the impact of creative destruction on inequality and wellbeing.\n\nSpecifically, the project will analyze how recent legislative changes in France have influenced individual incentives for self-employment, and how creative destruction affects social mobility and health. By examining these factors, the research aims to shed light on phenomena such as the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, rising income inequality, and firm dynamics. Ultimately, the findings will contribute to the development of more effective growth policies and strategies.\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical research, this project will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between innovation, growth, and social mobility. By bridging theory and data, the study has the potential to inform policy decisions and shape future research in this critical area."

The underlying framework is the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, where: (i) growth is generated by innovative entrepreneurs; (ii) entrepreneurial investments respond to incentives that are themselves shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations involves creative destruction. This project will explore new extensions of the Schumpeterian growth paradigm together with new firm-level and individual datasets to analyze the following questions : (a) the measurement of productivity growth and the extent to which measured TFP growth factors is correctly accounting for new innovation; (b) the relashionship between innovation and trade and more specifically the causal links from export and import to innovation, and the main channels through wich export and import affect innovation; (c) the effect of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship: in particular, how recent changes in the French legislation on self-employement have affected individual incentives to become self-employed, and differently so for different social or regional groups of individuals; (d) the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing: in particular, how does creative destruction (mesured by job or firm turnover) impact on social mobility (e.g measured by the probability of making it to top income brackets conditional upon a low initial income or a low parental income) and health. This approach can shed new light on important aspects of the growth process such as: the middle income trap, secular stagnation, the recent rise in top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Moreover, the paradigm can be used to think (or rethink) about growth policy design.",
