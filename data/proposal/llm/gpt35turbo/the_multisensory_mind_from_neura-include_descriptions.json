        "The proposed research program aims to investigate the neural and neurochemical markers of multisensory integration (MI) in the human brain. The study will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying how sensory inputs are merged to form coherent multisensory percepts, with a specific interest in how this process may be impaired in conditions such as schizophrenia. By utilizing advanced methods of cognitive neuroscience, including human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized neural activity, and neurochemical markers from magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this research program seeks to uncover the dynamic interplay of synchronized neural populations as a key factor in multisensory processes. \n\nThe research will include experiments involving both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, examining various modes of cognitive processes that require multisensory integration. By exploring the relationship between synchronized neural activity and neurotransmitter concentrations in specific brain areas, this research program has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of MI and provide new insights into the treatment of disorders characterized by impaired multisensory processing. Ultimately, this study could lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of how the human brain integrates sensory information and pave the way for new ideas, approaches, and theories in the field of multisensory processes."

Why are we better in hearing speech when we see a speakerâ€™s lip movements? These are questions of interest in the emerging field of multisensory integration (MI). Although the scientific study of MI on the behavioral level has existed since psychology became an experimental discipline, little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying MI in the human brain. The application of advanced methods of cognitive neuroscience now allow us to uncover the finer details of how sensory inputs are merged to become coherent multisensory percepts. This is of utmost importance in improving our understanding and treatment of conditions in which multisensory integration is impaired, such as schizophrenia. The main objective of the proposed research program is to examine neural and neurochemical markers of MI and to test a new hypothesis that considers dynamic interplay of synchronized neural populations as a key to multisensory processes. The studies within this program include healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, as a prototype of a mental disorder with deficits in MI. Multisensory processes will be examined in a series of experiments requiring various modes of cognitive processes. Reaching beyond the state-of-the-art, this comprises a combination of human EEG data as a macroscopic measure of cortical processing; source modeling of synchronized EEG activity; and neurochemical markers (magnetic resonance spectroscopy of resting neurotransmitter concentrations in selected brain areas). This research program will potentially lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of MI and will open new horizons in the generation of ideas, approaches, and theories regarding multisensory processes in the human brain.",
