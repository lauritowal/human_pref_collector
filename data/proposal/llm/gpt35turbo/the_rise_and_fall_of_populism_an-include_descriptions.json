        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the underlying causes of the recent rise in populist politicians in advanced democracies. Focusing on the impact of negative economic shocks, the project aims to understand the mechanisms that lead individuals to support extreme messages. The research will explore how personal experiences, information environments, and their interaction with economic shocks influence political decisions. \n\nThe study will be conducted in three parts. First, by analyzing a database of over 40 million resumes in the US from 2010-2016, the project will examine how personal employment histories, individual predispositions, and information environments influenced voting for populist politicians like Trump. Second, the research will investigate the impact of negative social experiences during formative years on labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and support for populist agendas using data on corporal punishment in UK schools during the 1970-80s. Lastly, the study will explore the factors that drive individuals to resist extremist regimes, focusing on resistance to the Nazi regime in Germany during WWII.\n\nThrough a combination of unique datasets and historical case studies, this project aims to shed light on the complex interplay between personal experiences, economic shocks, and political decisions in shaping support for populism and resistance to extremism."

Is populism caused by negative economic shocks? If so, what are the mechanisms? What explains heterogeneity in responses to such shocks? In this project, I will test empirically if personal experiences, information environment, and their interaction with aggregate economic shocks shape peopleâ€™s political decisions. The project consists of three parts. First, I will study how personal employment histories, potentially affected by globalization and technological shocks, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting for Trump. I will use a unique database of more than 40 million resumes for the period 2010-2016, the largest available repository of resumes of job-seekers in the US, which was not previously used in academic research, and match it with zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, I will study how negative social experiences during the formative years affect subsequent labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and the support of populist agenda. I will examine how corporal punishment in schools in UK affected subsequent educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting for UKIP and Brexit. I will digitize archival records on regulations and practice of corporal punishment in different educational authorities in the UK during 1970-80s, combining it with contemporary outcomes. Third, I will examine what makes people actively resist extremist regimes even when it is associated with high personal costs. I will study a historical example of resistance to Nazi regime in Germany during the WWII, which provides unique methodological opportunity to study determinants of resistance to extremism in a high stake environment. I will use a self-collected dataset on treason cases to measure resistance, combining it with data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda.",
