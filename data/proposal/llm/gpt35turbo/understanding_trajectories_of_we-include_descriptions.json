        "The WEALTHTRAJECT project aims to address the increasing wealth inequality in affluent societies by taking a dynamic perspective on wealth accumulation trajectories within and between social groups. By integrating various strands of literature, this project will explore how variability in wealth trajectories emerges over time through factors such as income, transfers from family members, and investment decisions. The innovative objectives of WEALTHTRAJECT include documenting variability in wealth trajectories over individuals' lifetimes, identifying drivers of this variability, establishing intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories, and collecting novel life history data on wealth accumulation. By challenging the prevailing idea of a uniform hump-shaped life cycle accumulation pattern, this project will provide new insights into wealth dynamics. Leveraging longitudinal data from surveys and registers, as well as original life history data on wealth, WEALTHTRAJECT will utilize advanced quantitative methods to map wealth trajectories over extended periods. Ultimately, this project aims to lay the foundations for a new understanding of wealth inequality that can inform relevant social policies and interventions."

Wealth inequality is on the rise in many affluent societies. It is time to move beyond prevailing static snapshots of average wealth inequality between people to understand this trend. Instead, a dynamic perspective on wealth changes experienced by people over their lifetimes is needed. This dynamic perspective reveals how diverse the trajectories of wealth accumulation are, i.e., the degree of trajectory variability. WEALTHTRAJECT integrates disconnected strands of literature to study how variability in trajectories emerges over time through the interplay of saving and spending of income, receipt of transfers from parents and other family members, and (de-)investment in (un-)profitable assets. WEALTHTRAJECT addresses four main innovative objectives: (i) to document variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives; (ii) to identify intragenerational drivers of variability in wealth trajectories; (iii) to establish the intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories; (iv) to collect novel life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories. To address these objectives, WEALTHTRAJECT innovates by adopting a novel approach emphasising the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses in people's lives. The project challenges the prevalent idea of a uniform hump-shaped life cycle accumulation pattern in wealth. WEALTHTRAJECT breaks new ground by combining longitudinal data from surveys and registers and original life history data on wealth that, for the first time, allow the mapping of wealth trajectories over extended periods of people's lives. Advanced quantitative methods are applied to leverage the untapped potential of these data. WEALTHTRAJECT lays the foundations for a new understanding of wealth inequality to inform relevant social policies.",
