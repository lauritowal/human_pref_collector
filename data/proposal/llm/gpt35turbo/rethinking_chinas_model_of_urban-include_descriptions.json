        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a ground-breaking research project that aims to rethink China's model of urban governance in the face of its unprecedented urbanisation. The project will conduct multi-scalar investigations in neighbourhoods, cities, and regions, focusing on the interface between state and society in everyday living spaces, development strategies and governance of migrant and ecological urbanism, and entangled state-market relations that shape the city-region. The research will be conducted in six diverse cases across China, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Through ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with local researchers and policymakers, the project aims to offer a contextually sensitive understanding of urban governance in China. By providing indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation, this research will contribute to entrepreneurial urban governance theories and offer a nuanced explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China. The project is not only timely in the current global context of trade tensions, but also crucial for China to implement a UN-endorsed new urban agenda. Through workshops and publication outputs, this research will change how we think of China and its governance, offering valuable insights for policymakers and scholars alike."

This ground-breaking project will rethink China’s model of urban governance through grounded and multi-scalar investigations ranging from neighbourhoods and cities to regions. For neighbourhoods, it unravels the interface between state and society in everyday living space, migrant social agencies and the self-governance of homeowners’ associations under urbanisation and housing marketization. For cities, it interrogates the development strategies and governance of migrant and ecological urbanism as well as the implementation of projects through financial instruments and the land market. For regions, it uncovers entangled state–market relations which redistribute population and economic activities across cities and produce the city-region. The research will be conducted through six cases: Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, based upon grounded ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews and close engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers across different types of neighbourhoods and cities of varying sizes in coastal, central and western regions, and recent national strategic projects. The project is timely for China to implement a UN-endorsed new urban agenda and rethink its model in the face of trade tensions. It will change how we think of China and its governance and be the first of its kind to explicitly consider indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation. This innovative and contextually sensitive research will contribute to entrepreneurial urban governance theories and will offer a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China, with six workshops organised within China as integral parts of knowledge production as well as a series of publication outputs.",
