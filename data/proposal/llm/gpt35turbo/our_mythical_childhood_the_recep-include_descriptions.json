    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking project focused on exploring the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' contemporary culture. While existing research in this field has primarily focused on Western culture, this project aims to expand the scope by examining regional perspectives from around the world. By considering regions as valuable contexts for the reception of Antiquity, this project will compare and analyze differing reception models across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. The goal is to uncover how children and young adults actively reshape classical traditions in response to regional and global challenges, ultimately deepening our understanding of social, political, and cultural transformations.\n\nLed by an international team of scholars, this project will conduct comparative studies, publish analyses of key reception cases, and develop materials on using ancient myths in work with disabled children to promote integration and cultural exchange. By leveraging the shared heritage of Classical Antiquity and the influence of popular culture, such as movies, Internet activities, and computer games inspired by the classical tradition, this project will have a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture. Through a supra-regional survey of classical references, this research aims to shed light on the dynamic relationship between the past and present, offering valuable insights into the formation of cultural identities and the initiation into adulthood."

This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients’ identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children’s and young adults’ culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and – a bold but necessary step – in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity – through the reception filter – to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.",
