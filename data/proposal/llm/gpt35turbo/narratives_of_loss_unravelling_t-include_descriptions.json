    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project seeks to investigate the impact of economic hardship on the support for socially conservative political agendas that aim to restrict the rights of marginalized groups in European societies. The rise in prejudice towards ethnic, linguistic, religious minorities, migrants, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and women, along with the increased support for far-right parties advocating for such restrictions, poses a threat to community cohesion. Building on existing evidence linking financial crises to the rise in far-right party support, this interdisciplinary project aims to develop a theoretical framework that explores how experiences of economic hardship lead to narratives of loss, which in turn fuel support for socially conservative political agendas. Through a multi-method empirical approach involving qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, the project will compare five European countries to uncover the role of context in shaping these narratives and political attitudes. By shedding light on the underlying mechanisms driving support for such agendas, the project aims to inform policies aimed at promoting social cohesion and inclusion in diverse European societies."

Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",
