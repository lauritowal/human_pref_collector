        "This grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project aimed at advancing the understanding of human cognition through the exploration of music perception. The project will consist of three core strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental. \n\nThe theoretical strand will focus on developing a novel unified theory of musical syntax that goes beyond context-free complexity and integrates harmonic structure with voice leading constraints. This will address current limitations in existing approaches to musical syntax and structure building. \n\nThe computational component of the project will involve the compilation of a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, which will be used to train and evaluate the unified syntax theory. This will be implemented using a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars. \n\nThe experimental strand will test the predictions of the formal framework developed in the theoretical strand regarding mental representations of musical structure. Key areas of focus will include nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. \n\nOverall, the outcomes of this project have the potential to significantly contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences by advancing our understanding of how humans represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures."

The proposed project aims at advancing the understanding of human cognition and, specifically, the capacity to represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures by exploring the rich potential of music perception. Building on the PI’s previous work, this interdisciplinary research programme will be divided into three core strands: (A) The theoretical strand will be devoted to the investigation of formal principles that govern musical syntax and structure building in Western and non-Western music. Many current approaches share the expressive power of (tree-based) context-free grammars and are mostly confined to harmonic syntax only. Therefore, they face difficulty in expressing certain crucial syntactic phenomena in music. To address this lacuna, the theoretical strand will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity and reconciles harmonic structure with the constraints of voice leading within a single coherent framework. (B) Addressing the lack of machine-readable corpora in music research, a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses will be compiled and published in the context of the project’s computational strand. Further, the unified syntax theory will be implemented based on a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars, and trained and evaluated using the analytical corpus. (C) The formal framework developed in (A) entails specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure that will be empirically tested in the experimental strand of the project. Particular focus will be on aspects of nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. The outcomes of the project will make a significant contribution to both the field of music cognition and to the cognitive sciences in general.",
