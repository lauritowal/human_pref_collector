        "The WRAPPED grant proposal aims to investigate the biological basis of human learning and brain plasticity by focusing on the role of myelin in the developmental process. By utilizing recent advancements in MRI technology, this project will assess changes in myelin levels in the living human brain during learning at different stages of development. The innovative approach of combining local longitudinal studies with large-scale open data analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of how myelin impacts learning across the lifespan. \n\nThe study will not only evaluate adults, but also infants as they learn to crawl, children as they enter school, and individuals of various ages learning novel skills such as juggling and reading Chinese. By examining the interactions between maturational changes in myelin and learning-related changes, WRAPPED will shed light on the unique human learning trajectory that enables us to establish and maintain complex cultures. \n\nThis research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of healthy human brain plasticity and serve as a reference point for studying psychological and neurological disorders that are linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. Ultimately, the findings of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying human learning and brain development."

What is the biological basis of this remarkable plasticity? Animal studies suggest a critical role of myelin in learning and brain plasticity, while post-mortem assessments of the human brain show that myelin maturation, which is completed around birth in other species, continues until adulthood. How does this uniquely protracted myelin development enable and constrain our aptitude for learning? WRAPPED will answer this critical question by assessing changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. Recent critical advances in MRI technology now provide the unprecedented opportunity to compare myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals making it possible to probe the role of myelin in human learning for the first time. Seizing this opportunity, WRAPPED will assess learning-related changes in myelin using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. Critically, WRAPPED will not only evaluate adults, but rather probe the entire developmental lifespan to show how myelin changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults are acquiring the same novel skills (juggling and reading Chinese). This ambitious developmental focus will be transformative for our understanding of the interactions between maturational and learning-related changes in myelin. Thereby, WRAPPED will elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory that allows us to establish and maintain complex cultures. This characterization of healthy human brain plasticity, in turn, will serve as a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.",
