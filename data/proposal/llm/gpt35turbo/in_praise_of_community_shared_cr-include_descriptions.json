        "The proposed project, titled INCOMMON, aims to conduct a comprehensive study of the field of performing arts in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s, focusing on the practice of commonality and its impact on artistic counterculture. By analyzing the historical context of the ‘laboratory Italy’ as a hub for innovative collaborations between artists in various mediums, the project seeks to highlight the significance of artistic communities and the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ in shaping the local and international art scene. Through the creation of a digital archive of performances by Italian artists from the period, INCOMMON will provide a valuable resource for researchers and enthusiasts interested in the creative, political, and existential wave of the counterculture. The project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating historical, philosophical, and artistic perspectives with Social Network Theory to uncover meaningful structures of meaning within artistic communities. By developing new methodologies for the interpretation and visualization of performing arts, INCOMMON aims to promote a deeper understanding of shared creative processes and preserve a cultural heritage that would otherwise be lost to future generations. This innovative project represents a unique opportunity to explore and document a pivotal moment in the history of Italian performing arts, enriching our knowledge of the cultural landscape of the period."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 289 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nINCOMMON will be the first study to systematically analyse the field of performing arts as resulting from the practice of commonality both theorized and experienced over the 1960s and the 1970s.In particular, the project is aimed to study the history of the ‘laboratory Italy’ as the place where artistic counterculture expressed by performing arts arose in a milieu characterized by a profound relation between philosophy, politics, and revolutionary practices. The overall objectives of INCOMMON are i) to study, collect and contextualize those encounters between theatre, music, visual arts, cinema and video art that assumed the form of performances, especially those created as collaborations between artists; ii) to apply the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ to the art field of the counterculture; iii) to underline the significance of artistic communities in the local and international scene; iv) to create a digital archive of the performances of the Italian artists of the period. The project will connect historical, philosophical and artistic debates to those in other sciences, sociology and in particular Social Network Theory,in order to reveal significant structures of meanings in the artistic community and to reveal the peculiar characteristics of shared creative processes.The methodology that will be developed is meant 1) to produce new ways of modelling the knowledge and interpretation of performing arts and 2) to create an innovative form of digital archive visualization, where rich interfaces will sustain and improve the understanding of the context and relationships analysed. INCOMMON will produce a comprehensive approach, oriented toward collection, digitalization, restoration and dissemination of direct documentation and related materials of the Italian performing arts production of the great creative, political, existential wave of the counterculture, preserving and making accessible a patrimony that otherwise will continue to be lost to future generations.",
