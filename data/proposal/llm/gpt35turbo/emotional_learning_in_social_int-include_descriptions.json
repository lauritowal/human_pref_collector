        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of emotional learning in social interactions through a novel research program that integrates the biology of aversive learning with social cognition. The project aims to achieve four specific objectives: to identify mechanisms of aversive learning about others based on stimulus and conceptual characteristics, to explore aversive learning from others through observation, to study aversive learning during interaction, and to build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. The research will employ a multi-method approach, including behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The proposed study predicts that social emotional learning involves the interaction of four neural networks coding for affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed aspects. It is hypothesized that the social-cognitive network will play a crucial role in distinguishing social learning from classical conditioning. The findings from this research have the potential to enhance our understanding of social phenomena such as group conflicts and norm compliance, as well as provide insights into psychological disorders like social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy, which are associated with dysfunctional social emotional learning systems."

By bringing together a novel set of experimental manipulations with two hitherto unconnected lines of research; biology of aversive learning and social cognition, it aims at answering four specific objectives, namely to identify the mechanisms of aversive learning (1) about others and its dependence on stimulus bound (e.g. ethnic group belonging) and conceptual (e.g. moral and social status) characteristics; (2) from others through observation, and its dependence on processing of stimulus bound (e.g. emotional expressiveness) and conceptual (e.g. empathy and mental state attributions) characteristics; (3) during interaction and its dependence social characteristics as described in 1 and 2; and (4) build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. To achieve these objectives, I propose a multi-method research program using novel behavioral paradigms and manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. I predict that social emotional learning will be accomplished through the interaction of four, partially overlapping, neural networks coding for affective, associative, social cognitive and instrumental/goal directed aspects. Whereas the two first networks will be common to classical conditioning and social learning, I hypothesize that the latter will be distinguished by its reliance on the social-cognitive network. The fourth network is predicted to be integral to the social learning through interactions and the shaping of behavioral norms. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of important social phenomena, such as group conflicts and norm compliance. It will also shed light on common psychological disorders, such as social anxiety, autism and psychopathy that are characterized by dysfunctional of the social emotional learning system.",
