        "This grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the impact of environmental adaptation on the spread and development of agriculture in Europe. By utilizing methods from population genomics and ecological modeling, this project aims to identify genetic loci within barley and wheat genomes that have undergone selection since the introduction of cereal cultivation in Europe. Additionally, ancient DNA sequencing and computer methods will be employed to determine the timing of these adaptations. By synthesizing this information with data on the spread of agriculture in Europe, demographic trends, and changes in cereal prevalence, this study will address the existing gap in understanding the relationship between human and environmental factors in the domestication of Europe. The ultimate goal of this research is to shed light on how crops adapted to new environments and how this influenced the adoption of agriculture as the primary subsistence strategy in different regions of Europe. This project represents a critical step in unraveling the complex interactions between agriculture, environmental conditions, and human societies in ancient Europe."

Archaeologists have long recognized that the ecological pressures placed on crops would have had an impact on the spread and subsequent development of agriculture, but previously there has been no means of directly assessing the scale and nature of this impact. Recent work that I have directed has shown how such a study could be carried out, and the purpose of this project is to exploit these breakthroughs with the goal of assessing the influence of environmental adaptation on the spread of agriculture, its adoption as the primary subsistence strategy, and the subsequent establishment of farming in different parts of Europe. This will correct the current imbalance between our understanding of the human and environmental dimensions to the domestication of Europe. I will use methods from population genomics to identify loci within the barley and wheat genomes that have undergone selection since the beginning of cereal cultivation in Europe. I will then use ecological modelling to identify those loci whose patterns of selection are associated with ecogeographical variables and hence represent adaptations to local environmental conditions. I will assign dates to the periods when adaptations occurred by sequencing ancient DNA from archaeobotanical assemblages and by computer methods that enable the temporal order of adaptations to be deduced. I will then synthesise the information on environmental adaptations with dating evidence for the spread of agriculture in Europe, which reveals pauses that might be linked to environmental adaptation, with demographic data that indicate regions where Neolithic populations declined, possibly due to inadequate crop productivity, and with an archaeobotanical database showing changes in the prevalence of individual cereals in different regions.",
