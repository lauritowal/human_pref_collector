        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project Colonial Memories: Remembering and Silencing the Colonial-Liberation Wars (CROME). The project aims to generate innovative knowledge on the memories of the wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. By adopting a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will analyze changes in the remembrance and silencing of these wars in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe. \n\nCROME is structured into two strands: 'Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States' will examine the role of states in shaping and recognizing the past, while 'Memory as a Battlefield' will explore the interaction between social and individual memories. The project hypothesizes that these wars, as transformative events, have triggered complex processes of memorialization and silencing with their own unique historicity.\n\nBy shedding light on the multiple memories and conflicting historical interpretations of these wars, CROME aims to provide a groundbreaking perspective on colonial-liberation war studies. This project will not only contribute to a better understanding of the past but also help in addressing the lasting effects of European colonialism in the present. Funding for CROME will support research activities, archival visits, and dissemination efforts to ensure the project's success in uncovering and analyzing the diverse memories of these pivotal moments in history."

The project’s main challenge is to produce innovative knowledge about the memories of the wars fought by the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements between 1961 and 1974/5. The approach chosen is simultaneously diachronic and comparative, inasmuch as it contrasts changes that took place between the end of the conflicts and nowadays, regarding how wars, colonial pasts and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that wars - as pivotal moments that ended the cycle of Empire in Portugal and started the cycle of African independences in the former Portuguese colonies - triggered memorialisation and silencing processes which had their own historicity. CROME is divided into two strands. The first one, named ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States’, looks at the role played by the states under consideration in mobilising, articulating and recognising the past, but also in actively generating selective representations. ‘Memory as a battlefield’ is the second strand, which will highlight distinct uses of the past and dynamics between social memories and individual memories. The project intends to demonstrate how wars gave rise to multiple memories and conflicting historical judgements, mostly in Portugal, but also to examine how the specific nature of the (post-)colonial histories of each African country has generated different ways to summon war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies. CROME will, thus, put forward a ground-breaking perspective in terms of colonial-liberation war studies, and will be instrumental in dealing with such traumatic experience, for its comparative approach might help overcoming everlasting constraints still at play today, caused by the historical burden European colonialism left behind.",
