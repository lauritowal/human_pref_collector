        "The proposed project seeks to address the growing global phenomenon of foraging as an economic strategy in the Anthropocene. With a focus on practices of collecting, scavenging, and gleaning, the project aims to develop a political ecology of foraging by examining its socio-environmental entanglements. In a time when traditional avenues to economic stability are diminishing, foraging has emerged as a vital means of upward social mobility for many around the world. This project is timely given the increasing relevance of foraging post the 2008-2011 financial crisis and the pressing need for environmental conservation amidst the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Through an interdisciplinary approach rooted in anthropology, an international team of researchers based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, will conduct this study. The project will yield two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition, contributing valuable insights to academia and society at large. By shedding light on the complexities and frictions at the interface of foraging and environmental conservation, this project aims to deepen our understanding of this increasingly important economic activity in the modern world."

In Tibet and Nepal, scores of collectors rush to the mountains each spring to collect yartsagunbu – a rare mushroom more valuable than gold. In Siberia, “tuskers” scavenge for woolly mammoth ivory in the thawing permafrost. From Amazonia to Mongolia, artisanal miners extract precious minerals where transnational conglomerates have left. In the US, “Amazon nomads” tour foreclosed shops and sell their bounty online. Broadly understood as practices of collecting, scavenging and gleaning, foraging is a global phenomenon of our times. However, it only gains patchy attention in mainstream debates on conservation and development. What is missing is a conceptual understanding of foraging as a basic economic strategy and a form of socio-environmental entanglement. The objective of this project is to take on this task and develop a political ecology of foraging in the Anthropocene. The project is timely. In the aftermath of the world financial crisis between 2008 to 2011, foraging has gained in relevance around the globe. In an era when the dream of a middle-class life based on a stable, salaried job no longer seems viable, and in places where the welfare state is under pressure, has never existed or has vanished, foraging is often the only avenue to upward social mobility. At the same time, the climate crisis and concerns for the rapid loss of biodiversity are raising the urgency for environmental conservation. To understand the evolving frictions at this interface is highly relevant at this historical moment – both in academia and beyond. Interdisciplinary in outlook but grounded in anthropology, the project will be carried out by an international team of five researchers at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich. Outputs include 2 monograph, 3 edited collections, 3 PhD thesis, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film and an exhibition.",
