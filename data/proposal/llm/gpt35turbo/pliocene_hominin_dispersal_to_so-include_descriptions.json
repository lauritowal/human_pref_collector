        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the early evolution of human behavioral and physiological flexibility by studying Plio-Pleistocene hominins in South Africa. By examining the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, creating dynamic palaeo-precipitation/-vegetation models, and conducting detailed anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record, this project aims to unravel the reasons behind the presence of hominins in temperate zones during this time period. The research will focus on determining species diversity, geneflow, and dispersal scenarios through the integration of various datasets. The proposal is grounded in three key working hypotheses: the expansion and contraction of hominin ranges in East Africa, the impact of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation on dispersal corridors and gene flow between East African and South African hominins, and the tectonic and hydrographic changes affecting dispersal patterns in Southern Africa during the Pleistocene. By addressing these hypotheses, the project aims to shed light on the evolutionary history of early human populations and their ability to adapt to changing environments."

This trait facilitated their dispersal out-of-Africa to higher latitudes, i.e. to temperate and seasonal habitats, during the Pleistocene. However, there are Plio-Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa (SA) from ~3.7Ma onwards. Did human behavioural/physiological flexibility evolve early in our evolutionary history? Alternatively, did Pliocene hominins occupy such temperate zones due to different palaeoclimatic conditions in deep time and/or due to stochastic events? To untangle these questions this project will: (1) determine the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, (2) create dynamic palaeo-precipitation/-vegetation models from various archives, (3) carry out detailed anatomical, functional and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record and (4) combine the datasets to appraise species diversity (functional adaptations), geneflow (hybridization) and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography). 3 key working hypotheses underlie the proposal: 1. >2.6Ma East African (EA) hominin ranges expanded/contracted in accord with wet and dry phases; periodically, the southernmost populations became reproductively isolated. Early SA hominins represent descendants of Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, respectively. 2. ~2.6-1.5Ma With the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the re-organisation of the drainage pattern within the Kalahari basin, dispersal corridors repeatedly closed (vicariance) and opened, resulting in intermittent levels of gene flow (i.e. hybridization) between EA and SA hominins. 3. <~1.5Ma Tectonic and hydrographic changes led to the Zambezi River becoming a powerful barrier during the Pleistocene. SA hominins younger than 1.5Ma are likely the result of endemism; competitive exclusion amongst these hominins resulted in exploitation of distinct ecological niche",
