    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for an anthropological study on combat trauma in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. The project aims to explore how clinical notions of combat trauma are established and adapted in different nations, shedding light on the values and beliefs surrounding violence and suffering within military and psychiatric institutions. Through ethnographic fieldwork with veterans, research on clinical practices, and analysis of institutional policies, the study will provide a comparative framework for understanding the impact of combat trauma on individuals and society. By examining how veterans and clinicians perceive ethnicity, the research will also contribute to understanding the experiences of minority groups in these institutions. The project is expected to identify challenges in providing care to veterans and influence policy and healthcare practices. In addition, it will advance studies of biopolitics and medicalization by exploring how patients contest clinical models of combat trauma. By addressing the moral significance of violence and suffering in combat trauma, the study aims to uncover forms of resistance to clinical illness models that have not been previously explored. Ultimately, this research will enhance our understanding of how war-related suffering is perceived, internalized, and treated within military and psychiatric contexts, contributing to social science studies of psychiatry during a time of significant transformation in the field."

Trauma means different things to different actors, and acquires a different value (both economic and social) in different therapeutic settings. Research will examine how clinical notions of combat trauma are established, adapted, resisted or internalized in different nations. It will result in a comparative framework for understanding how combat trauma is shaped by two major modern institutions: the military and psychiatry. Methodologically, it combines ethnographic fieldwork with veterans, research on clinical practices, and analysis of the policies and discourses that institutionalize combat trauma. Unusual within trauma studies, it aims to shed light on potentially conflicting values about violence and suffering in military and psychiatric instiutions, which may be less apparent to researchers trained within those institutions. By analyzing how veterans and clinicians perceive ethnicity, it will also contribute to understanding of the experiences of subordinate ethnic groups in military and psychiatric institutions. It is expected to identify key problems in the delivery of good care to veterans and have an impact on policy and healthcare. Theoretically, it will advance studies of biopolitics and medicalization. Existing theories tend to minimize how patients contest clinical models of illness. The moral significance of violence in combat trauma may, however, create particular kinds of resistance to clinical illness models â€“ an issue that has not been previously addressed. This study will make a major contribution to understanding how war related suffering is internalized and institutionalized as clinical illness. It will also advance social science studies of psychiatry during a time when the field is undergoing a major and controversial move towards a biological approach to mental illness.",
