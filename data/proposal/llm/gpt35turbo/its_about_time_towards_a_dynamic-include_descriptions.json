        "The proposed grant, titled \"Temporal Integration and Multiscale Exploration (TIME) in Human Vision,\" seeks to revolutionize the study of visual perception by shifting the focus from bottom-up categorization to a more holistic approach that incorporates semantic understanding, active information sampling, and temporal dynamics. This project will utilize cutting-edge non-invasive brain imaging techniques to observe participants as they explore thousands of natural scenes, while also developing novel multivariate analysis methods and a bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision. By combining these approaches, TIME aims to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying visual semantic understanding, information integration, and decision-making processes in the brain. Through this interdisciplinary research program, TIME will provide unprecedented insights into the complex neural processes involved in vision, leading to a fundamental paradigm shift in the field. Ultimately, this project will bridge the gap between biological and synthetic vision systems, paving the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain actively processes visual information in real-time."

To tap into this resource, the brain?s visual system engages in complex, intertwined computations to actively sample, extract, and integrate information across space and time. Surprisingly however, the integrative nature of vision hardly plays a role in the way we approach it in experimentation and computational modelling. Instead, higher-level vision is commonly treated as a largely bottom-up categorization process. TIME proposes a new approach. It will allow us to study vision in a more natural setting and as a process that is (a) geared towards semantic understanding instead of label-based categorisation, (b) naturally intertwined with active information sampling and (c) expanding across multiple timeframes, including network dynamics that unfold within and across eye fixations. This will be accomplished by an ambitious, three-step work program that combines cutting-edge non-invasive human brain imaging performed while participants visually explore tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, the development of novel multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modelling using a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision that closes the sensory-motor loop. Using this interdisciplinary approach, TIME will establish, for the first time, when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain as it actively samples and integrates information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. These ground-breaking developments both in experimentation and deep neural network modelling build towards a fundamental paradigm shift in how we study, model, and understand vision, yielding new insights into its complex neural processes operating in more natural, ecologically valid conditions, as well as a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision.",
