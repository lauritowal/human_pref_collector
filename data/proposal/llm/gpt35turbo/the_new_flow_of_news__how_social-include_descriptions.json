    "descriptions": [
        "The grant proposal seeks to investigate the changing landscape of news consumption as traditional media outlets adapt to the rise of social network sites (SNSs). By examining the roles of news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees in the dissemination of news content on SNSs, the project aims to uncover the implications of this shift on political beliefs and behaviors of individuals. Through a new model based on network logic, the study will employ a combination of innovative methods including big data analysis, content analysis, interviews with news editors, laboratory observations, and longitudinal surveys. By analyzing traffic data, conducting laboratory observations, and tracking long-term political effects through survey and behavioral data over a two-year period, the research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of social news distribution on political behavior. This project is not only theoretically and empirically innovative, but also has the potential to set a new standard for audience research by offering a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence. The findings of this study have the potential to significantly influence future research in the fields of media and political studies."

To accommodate this trend, news industry has been incorporating SNSs into its platforms, changing news into a social product. The project will explore this process and reveal its implications for news production and audiences’ political behavior. I develop a new model anchored in network logic and involving three key actors in news creation and distribution: news organizations, which are adapting news production to the logic of sharing; news feeders – users who select and disseminate news stories, thereby serving as a bridge between their online followers and news organizations; and news feedees – individuals whose news consumption is limited to stories fetched for them by feeders in their SNSs. The model points to some long-term effects on individuals' political beliefs and behavior as a consequence of acting as feeders or feedees. Multiple innovative methods will be employed, some of which will be implemented in the field of media and political studies for the first time. The methods are mutually complementary, combining ‘big data’ analysis with small-N in-depth designs. To study news organizations, I will interview news editors and analyze traffic data juxtaposing it against content analysis. To study users’ behavior and identify feeders and feedees, I will conduct a laboratory observation in which surfing behavior and physiological attention indices will be measured unobtrusively. Long-term political effects will be tested using a combination of survey panel data and web-based behavioral data spanning a period of two years. The proposal is theoretically and empirically innovative and can impact future research by providing novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption and influence, as well as by introducing a new methodological ‘golden standard’ to audience research.",
