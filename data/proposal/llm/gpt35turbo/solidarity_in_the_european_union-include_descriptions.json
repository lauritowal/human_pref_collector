        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the principles of socioeconomic justice within the European Union, focusing on the concept of solidarity. The project aims to develop a normative model of solidarity that is tailored to the unique circumstances of the EU and to apply this model to key issues such as free movement of persons, refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement. By doing so, it will contribute to the ongoing debates on the nature and development of the EU, international justice, and the intersection between facts and normative political theory. This research is crucial in addressing pressing issues facing the EU today and in understanding the obligations of European citizens in promoting social justice across borders."

Do not include information not available in the description below.

Do European citizens have obligations of social justice that cross the borders of member states? If so, what are their grounds? I propose to answer these questions by providing a normative account of one of the fundamental values underpinning European integration, namely solidarity. The project has two main aims. The first is to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity that is responsive to the specific circumstances and history of the European Union (EUSOL1). The second aim is to apply this model to a number of central issues dividing the EU, including the free movement of persons, burden-sharing within the EUâ€™s refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). The project breaks new ground in normative debates on the nature and development of the EU, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory, and addresses some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today.",
