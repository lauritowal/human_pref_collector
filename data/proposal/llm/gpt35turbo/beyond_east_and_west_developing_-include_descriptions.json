        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project aimed at integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. By addressing the challenges of tuning, texture, and differences in oral and notated performance traditions, this project aims to create a new, East-West strand of music and opera. Through research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, the project will train traditional Turkish instrumentalists, Western singers, and explore the impact of this new music on musicians and audiences. The project will also develop new instruments and techniques for merging sounds, conduct studies on timbre, and create a template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems. The research outcomes will be compiled into an e-book titled Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), which will include audio and visual examples as an online resource. In addition to advancing the field of music composition, this project's multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach will provide insights into transcending cultural barriers through the creative process. By exploring the intersection of Eastern and Western musical traditions, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how art can bridge cultural divides in today's world."

But differences in tuning, texture, and between oral and notated orientations to performance have presented seemingly intractable obstacles. This project systematises practical processes essential for the creation of a new, East-West strand of contemporary music and opera. It initiates cutting-edge research workshops in Istanbul, Holland and the UK to: 1. Train top-level traditional instrumentalists and singers in Turkey effectively to perform a new repertoire; 2. Train top professional Western singers in non-Western techniques and nuances of vocal production; 3. Develop approaches for modelling such music's impacts on Turkish and Western musicians’ adaptive processes in rehearsal and performance, and diverse audiences’ perceptions of such music; 4. Create an ensemble interface (including newly designed instruments) to increase capacity for merging sounds beyond levels now achievable; 5. Produce groundbreaking studies on timbre to provide new insights into how sound is produced; 6. Establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems onto one another. This research, together with an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds will comprise the core of a published (CUP) team-authored e-book, Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), with included audio and visual examples linked as an online resource. Looking further, this project’s multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach also suggests a model for probing how the ‘free play’ of the imagination (Kant) possible within processes of art and its creation can provide metaphors towards understanding one of the most urgent and compelling issues of our time: how to transcend cultural barriers (real or imagined) that exist today.",
