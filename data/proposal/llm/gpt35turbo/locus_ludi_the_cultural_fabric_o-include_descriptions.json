    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, Locus Ludi, seeks to conduct a comprehensive study of play and games in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds from 800 BCE to 500 CE. By examining written, archaeological, and iconographic sources that have been largely neglected in modern times, the project aims to shed light on the role of play in shaping cultural identities and societal structures. Through interdisciplinary methods including linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, and anthropological analyses, the research team will identify, categorize, and reconstruct ancient games and play activities. \n\nBy exploring ludic culture as a reflection of gendered, religious, economic, and political dynamics, Locus Ludi will provide insights into interactions between different populations, such as the romanisation process and religious shifts. The project will also consider the educational and integrative functions of play in ancient societies, offering a new perspective on the cultural fabric of the past. \n\nThe outcomes of this research will not only contribute to scholarly advancements in the study of ancient play and games, but also provide valuable material for educational purposes in schools, museums, and libraries. By understanding the historical significance of play, Locus Ludi aims to inform ongoing debates on contemporary forms of sociability and the role of play in modern society. Ultimately, this project will serve as a benchmark for future research in related fields and offer a fresh perspective on the importance of play in shaping human interactions and cultural identities."

Even gods played. Ludic culture created communities from early childhood to a ripe old age. Did these groups play together, or did they play different games, with distinct rules? And did they play similar games to us? This interdisciplinary project will provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence. Written, archaeological and iconographic sources are abundant, but forgotten in museums and libraries. This neglect is due to the modern Western view of games as childrenâ€™s pastime, if not a waste of time. Ancient play and games reflect the gendered, religious, economic, and political fabric of a society, as much as they shape the lives of players by transmitting a cultural identity and an intangible heritage. Ludic culture evolves over time and this project intends to provide a benchmark by reconstructing this history in the Greek world, from the birth of the city-state, c. 800 BCE, to the Roman conquest in 146 BCE, and in the Roman world from the Republican age, c. 500 BCE, to the end of the Western Roman Empire, c. 500 CE. Locus Ludi will identify, categorize, and reconstruct games and play thanks to close linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological studies. Ludic culture also mirrors interactions between different populations, as in the romanisation process, and religious shifts. The research will be informed by theoretical studies of the past as well as by gender and education studies. It will generate a new vision of the cultural fabric of ancient society, provide models for training and research in related fields, as well as up-to-date material for schools, museums, and libraries. Understanding the educational, societal and integrative role of play in the past is important to understand the present and widen the debate on high tech toys and new forms of sociability.",
