        "The proposed project, titled POLYCHROME, aims to investigate the evolution of richly painted and gilded Christian images in the Nordic countries since the Reformation. Focusing on wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces, the study will explore how these objects have transitioned from objects of devotion to elements of cultural heritage. Despite the significant changes in values attached to Catholic devotional objects following the Reformation, there is limited information available on the status, volatility, and repairs of these polychromed artifacts. POLYCHROME will address this gap by utilizing advanced technologies from the natural sciences to analyze approximately 150 partially mutilated polychromed objects in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. By examining the material data, the project aims to determine whether damages and losses can be attributed to targeted violence, accidents, or inherent weaknesses. Additionally, the research will map restorations and repairs, providing a foundation for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates on heritage values and the future preservation of religious heritage in the Nordic region. The findings of this project will challenge existing narratives on the impact of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects and will inform future training priorities in the field of conservation and heritage preservation."

How have wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces transformed from potent objects of devotion to cultural heritage? To what extent is this category of cultural heritage at risk? Values attached to Catholic devotional objects have fluctuated dramatically since Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway declared a break with the church in Rome (1527 and 1537, respectively). However, documentary sources shed little light on changes in status, volatility, and repairs. POLYCHROME will take an ambitious leap that scholars concerned with polychromy in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been reluctant to make: to determine the extent to which losses of noses, eyes and limbs are tied to iconoclastic acts. To date, historians and most conservators have attributed damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism, but not to targeted violence. This is due in part to a lack of archival evidence, but also because secondary paints often mask critical information on surfaces and in internal structures. POLYCHROME will harness technologies from the natural sciences to create, from the ground up, the first analytical overview of c. 150 polychromed objects that are (or potentially were) partially mutilated. The material data will offer essential foundations for determining whether damages and losses can be linked to violence, accidents or inherent weakness. The data will guide the mapping of restorations and repairs, and will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates about heritage values and the future care of religious heritage in the Nordics. The outcomes will complicate conversations about the preserving effects of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects, and will influence training priorities for years to come.",
