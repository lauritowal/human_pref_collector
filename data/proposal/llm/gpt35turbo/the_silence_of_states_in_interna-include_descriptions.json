        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking research project on the concept of State silence in international law. The study will investigate the legal implications of when States choose to do nothing, examining whether their silence can bind them and under what circumstances. The project will also explore the role of State inaction in determining State responsibility and its impact on international dispute settlement, with a particular focus on proceedings before international courts and tribunals.\n\nThis research aims to fill significant gaps in our understanding of State silence and its legal effects. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of State practice, international jurisprudence, and literature in six official languages of the United Nations, the project will develop a taxonomy of different types of State silences and their consequences. Additionally, empirical analysis of the reasoning behind government officials' and international judges' decisions will be utilized to assess the advantages and disadvantages of States' non-appearance in international judicial procedures.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to make a major contribution to the field of international law by shedding light on the complex implications of State silence. The findings of this research have the potential to inform future developments in international legal norms and procedures, promoting a more nuanced understanding of the obligations of States and how they can be enforced within the international legal framework."

It is identified by observing the behaviour of States and deriving rules from their behaviour. But, what happens when States do nothing? Can States be bound by their own silence? Can international law develop through the silence of States? Can States be responsible for doing nothing? What happens when States do not appear before international courts and tribunals? These questions are immensely significant for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, who are all interested in knowing what the obligations of States are and how they can be enforced within and outside international courts and tribunals. Yet, there are major gaps in our understanding of the meaning of State silence and its legal effects. This project is the first comprehensive study of the silence of States in international law. It will explore and analyze whether the silence of States can bind them, and if so, under which circumstances; the role of State inaction for the responsibility of States; and the effect of State inaction in the field of international dispute settlement, focusing particularly on the proceedings before international courts and tribunals. It aims (a) to make a major contribution to knowledge on the meaning of silence by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the ‘silences’ of States and on the legal effects of different ‘silences’; and (b) to critically analyse whether a change in the law may be called for. The project will conduct research in wide-ranging and geographically representative State practice available in the six official languages of the United Nations, international jurisprudence and literature. It will also employ empirical analysis of the reasoning of government officials’ and international judges in order to assess the advantages and disadvantages of States silence, in the form of non-appearance, in international judicial procedures.",
