        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking project that will explore the role of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism in shaping social knowledge and science. By analyzing these often overlooked pieces of panoramic literature, the project aims to challenge traditional disciplinary boundaries and Eurocentric narratives of social science history. Through a combination of anthropological and historiographical approaches, the project will investigate the representational techniques of sociographic journalism, its connections to epistemic developments, its socio-spatial embeddedness, and its relationship to broader societal processes. The outcomes of the project will include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs, shedding light on the evolution of social knowledge in Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and colonial Latin America. By highlighting the significance of sociographic journalism as a formative genre of modern social science, this project promises to contribute to a more comprehensive and transdisciplinary understanding of the history of sociological and anthropological reasoning."

It represents the first comprehensive study to investigate pieces of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as formative frames/catalysts of social knowledge and science. These social sketches (often referred to as panoramic literature) provide rich ethnographic micro-analysis and often relate to debates held by statisticians, moralists, folklorists, and ethnologists. However, in the discipline-oriented histories of the social sciences and humanities, journalism has been ignored as a form of knowledge and as a founding genre of modern (disciplinary, academic) social science. By exploring the epistemic significance of sociographic journalism, the project promises to institute a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational historiography of the evolution of social knowledge and to revise mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric tales of the past and present. The project has five kinds of outcome: a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. The corpus comprises social sketches and examples of related knowledge frames (travel accounts, philanthropic reports, caricatures etc.) from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The project develops an innovative mix of anthropological/historiographical approaches to examine (1) the representational techniques of sociographic journalism (e.g., methods of constructing social types, the influence of scientific paradigms); (2) how it connects with epistemic developments (e.g., towards materialist and historicizing conceptions of society); (3) its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects; and (4) how the journalistic sketches are to be situated against processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.",
