        "This grant proposal seeks funding to support a research project focused on understanding the factors contributing to banking crises through an analysis of credit growth and financial regulation. The project will utilize micro-level datasets to empirically identify the impact of financial innovations, mortgage lending, real estate prices, borrower information, and leverage on loan growth by financial institutions. By combining appropriate methodologies and theoretical frameworks, the project aims to provide decisive empirical evidence on the role and relevancy of these factors in the buildup to banking crises. The research will also explore how potential combinations of these factors interact to spur credit growth, enhancing our understanding of the dynamics within the global banking system. The ultimate goal of the project is to advance the identification and estimation of the impact of individual ingredients on credit growth, while ensuring maximum external validity through the selection of diverse datasets and methodologies. This research will fill a critical gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between financial practices, regulations, and credit expansion, ultimately contributing to the development of effective macroprudential policies to mitigate the negative effects of banking crises on the macro real sector."

Their damaging real effects have generated a broad agreement among academics and policymakers that financial regulation needs to tighten and to obtain a macroprudential dimension that aims to lessen the negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector. Among the main ingredients that are often mentioned to have played a role in the explosive growth of credit in the run-up to the latest financial crisis are the financial innovations by financial institutions, in particular loan securitization, the boom in mortgage lending and prices of real estate, the lack of information about prospective borrowers, and the high leverage (and corresponding low capital ratios) of financial institutions. Yet, despite the singling out of these ingredients by policymakers, decisive empirical evidence about their role and relevancy is lacking. However, given the magnitude and complexity of the global banking system and the lack of encompassing micro-level data, it is currently impossible to confidently study the impact of all ingredients jointly. This project therefore analyses pertinent settings where we can empirically identify the correspondence between the aforementioned individual ingredients and the credit granting by financial institutions. The objective of the project is to advance identification and estimation of the impact of each respective factor on loan growth by combining the appropriate methodology with an exceptional set of micro-level datasets. When missing in the literature a theoretical framework will be provided. The project further aims to assess how potential combinations of these ingredients may have interacted in spurring credit growth. While the identification of the impact of each ingredient on credit growth is paramount, the individual setting of the studied datasets and employed methodologies will ensure maximum external validity.",
