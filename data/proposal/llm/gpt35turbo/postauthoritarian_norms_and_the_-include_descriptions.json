        "The proposed project, POSTNORM, seeks to investigate the decline of left-wing parties in Poland and the delayed emergence of a radical right party in Portugal by examining the impact of past authoritarian regimes on political ideologies in new democracies. The research will focus on how the rejection of the ideological brand of the old regime influences voters and political elites, shaping their preferences and perceptions of appropriate political positions. Through innovative survey experiments, POSTNORM aims to test the hypothesis that the associations with the previous authoritarian regime serve as a focal point for norms governing political behavior and party competition. By exploring the demand- and supply-side dynamics of party competition in post-transition democracies, the project will generate a new theory to explain the variations in political competition across different new democracies. The findings from POSTNORM have the potential to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing political ideologies and party dynamics in transitioning democracies."

Why has Portugal been one of the last countries in Western Europe to see a radical right party in the national parliament? Why are right-wing individuals more likely to protest in Eastern Europe than left-wing individuals (Kostelka and Rovny 2019)? POSTNORM proposes a theory postulating that these seemingly unrelated patterns are the product of a single process: the rejection of the ideological brand of the past authoritarian regime. Through novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will examine how in new democracies, the ideological associations with the old regime serve as a focal point for norms that govern what are appropriate political positions for voters and parties: in democracies following left(right-)wing dictatorship, voters and political elites avoid associating themselves with the left(right) respectively. POSTNORM further derives a set of testable expectations about how this bias shapes both the demand- and the supply side of party competition. The bias colors citizens’ ideological preferences; perceptions about parties’ stances in these issues; national identity; political discussions; the supply of new parties; post-transition party names and pro-grammatic stances; and party elite discourse. POSTNORM will deliver a parsimonious new theory that will help make sense of heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies",
