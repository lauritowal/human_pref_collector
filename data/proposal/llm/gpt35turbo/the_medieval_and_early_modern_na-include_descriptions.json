        "This grant proposal aims to address the lack of detailed technical study on the evolution and use of pre-Mercator nautical charts, a critical aspect of early modern maritime expansion. Building on the established discipline of History of Cartography, this project will take an interdisciplinary approach utilizing innovative tools such as analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and manuscript examination through special lighting. By applying these techniques to a diverse selection of charts from various periods and origins, the project aims to uncover hidden graphic content, characterize geometric features, establish connections with navigational methods and exploration missions, and simulate construction processes based on textual sources. The proposed research builds on the success of previous studies, including the resolution of the historical enigma surrounding the construction of the Mercator projection in 1569. By addressing longstanding questions in cartographic history, this project has the potential to make groundbreaking contributions not only to the field of History of Cartography but also to intellectual history at large. The results of this study have the potential to shed new light on the technical and scientific developments that paved the way for early modern maritime exploration, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the role of nautical charts in shaping the worldviews of European nations during this period."

This fact is very surprising as it was through those charts that the newly discovered world was first shown to the amazed eyes of the European nations. Although the History of Cartography is a well-established academic discipline and old charts have been examined for many years, their detailed technical study is still in its infancy. What is the origin of the pre-Mercator nautical chart, how charts evolved technically over time and how they were used at sea are all critical questions that remain to be answered. I intend to approach these challenges in a truly interdisciplinary way, by using innovative and powerful tools as a complement to the traditional methods of historical research: analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling and the examination of the manuscripts through special lighting. By applying these tools to a large sample of charts of various periods and origins, I aim to unveil hidden graphic content related to their construction and use, to characterize their main geometric features, to establish meaningful connections with contemporary navigational methods and exploration missions, and to numerically simulate their construction by taking into account the explanations given in the textual sources. The effectiveness of those techniques has already been demonstrated in my previous studies, such as in the solution of an historical enigma which had been alive for more than a century: the construction of the Mercator projection, in 1569. Now, I propose to handle a broader and more complex set of questions, which has eluded the historians of cartography for even a longer period. The clarification of these issues will have a ground-breaking impact, not only in the strict field of the History of Cartography, but also in the context of the intellectual history at large.",
