        "This grant proposal seeks to challenge the dominant discourse surrounding World literature by exploring the multilingual and located nature of literary traditions in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia. By moving away from the idea that only texts that circulate globally in English are worthy of being considered \"world literature,\" this project aims to establish a more inclusive and diverse approach to literary studies. Focusing on three key periods - imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment - we will investigate local transculturations, debates on world literature, and the dynamics of print and orality in these regions. Through this research, we hope to highlight the appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices that shape local and transnational literary fields. The project will not only propose a new theoretical framework for understanding world literature but also develop methods for multilingual training and research. Additionally, we plan to engage in strategic dialogues with scholars and writers in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France to foster a more collaborative and inclusive approach to literary studies. Ultimately, this project seeks to challenge the monolingual constraints of modern literary histories and promote a more nuanced understanding of the diverse and rich literary traditions that exist around the world."

It is mostly in English. Its main genre is the novel.” These are caricatures of how World literature as a set of discourses is shaping the field of literary studies, but in fact Non-Western literatures are positioned with reference to a single global timeline and a single map, and translations supposedly ensure that worthy texts enter the global canon. What does not circulate globally is provincial, not good enough, not “world literature”. This picture bears little resemblance to the multilingual world of literature, which consists not of a single map but of many “significant geographies” specific to language, group, and genre. By exploring the often fractured “multilingual locals” and “significant geographies” of literature in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia—each with different experiences of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and continuing oral traditions—we seek to establish a multilingual and located approach to world literature in place of meta-categories like “global” and “world”. Mindful of older histories and networks of literary multilingualism and critical of the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories that partition Anglophone and Francophone literature from Arabic, Amharic, and Hindi/Urdu, we focus on three periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. We will study local transculturations, local debates on world literature, old and new forms of multilingualism, actors and technologies of print and orality, to highlight dynamics of appropriation rather than imitation, co-constitution rather than diffusion, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories that together form local and transnational literary fields (“world literature”). The project will propose a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues with scholars and writers in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, UK and France.",
