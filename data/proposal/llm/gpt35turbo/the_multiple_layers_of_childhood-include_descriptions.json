        "This grant proposal aims to address the societal challenge of health inequality by focusing on childhood adversity and its long-lasting effects on health outcomes. The project, named LAYERS, will create a unified data infrastructure to analyze the impact of multiple layers of childhood adversity on the health of 2 million individuals over three generations. By combining data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework, the project will generate knowledge on the patterns of health inequality that emerge early in life and transcend generations. The goal is to understand the mechanisms that drive these patterns and how they evolve over time.\n\nIn addition, LAYERS will establish a real-world policy data lab to translate research findings into actionable public health interventions. By integrating evidence from nationwide policies and simulations, the project aims to identify children and families in need of targeted support to break the cycle of adversity and improve health outcomes. This innovative approach will fill a major gap in current research on childhood adversity, which has predominantly focused on social factors. By exploring the intersection of biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental layers of adversity, LAYERS will pave the way for a new frontier in health inequality research."

Childhood is a sensitive period with rapid growth and development, and adversity during this period may have long-lasting health effects. More importantly, multiple forms of adversity intersect with each other, and disadvantaged children are often exposed to adversity across multiple biological, health, social, neighbourhood and environmental layers, but the childhood adversity literature has almost exclusively focused on social adversity. This is a major gap in our understanding, and empirical data which transcends multitude layers of adversity and follows individuals over entire life courses or across generations is lacking. With LAYERS, I am in a unique position to meet this challenge by creating a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of multiple layers of childhood adversity in 2M people over three generations combined with an interdisciplinary fusion of methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a newly developed complex systems framework. This innovative combination of data and methods will allow for a systematic generation of knowledge on the patterns of health inequality that emerge in early life and transcend generations, the mechanisms which generate these patterns, and the dynamics that make them change over time. To translate these insights into actionable public health, LAYERS will establish a real-world policy data lab which integrates evidence from nationwide policies and simulations. Combined, these interconnected elements will redirect the next frontier in health inequality research towards the multiple layers of adversity which generate inequality over the life course and across generations. Ultimately, this will help us break vicious circles of adversity by identifying children and families who would benefit from targeted support.",
