        "This grant proposal aims to develop a portable, wireless EEG-based device for the early detection of social predispositions and impairments in newborns, which could serve as a valuable biomarker for autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). Building on previous research, this device will utilize an innovative oscillatory visual presentation of face-like patterns to extract an EEG-based index of face processing in less than 2 minutes of a newborn's visual attention. Currently, EEG recordings in newborns are limited to laboratory settings due to the lack of a portable EEG system adapted for newborns. By creating a device that combines our experimental paradigm with a portable, low-power EEG system and an automatic algorithm for real-time data extraction, we aim to enable easy, rapid, and automatic testing of face processing in newborns in any context, including their homes. This ground-breaking device has the potential to revolutionize early screening protocols for infants at risk for ASD, providing an objective and easy-to-use tool for identifying social impairments from the onset of life. Furthermore, the flexibility of the paradigm opens up possibilities for exploring the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns, making this research method not only clinically relevant but also scientifically valuable."

An early detector of social predispositions and their impairment in newborns might provide a valuable biomarker for ASD, an indicator of utmost relevance since infants with ASD greatly benefit from early behavioral intervention. This proposal builds on a study performed within my ERC grant in which, by designing an innovative oscillatory visual presentation of face-like patterns and perceptually equivalent controls, we identified an EEG-based index of face processing, present in each newborn tested and obtainable with less than 2 minutes of newborn’s visual attention. However, recording newborn’s EEG is currently possible only in laboratory settings, as no fully portable EEG system adapted for newborns exists in the market. The goal of this proposal is to design a portable, wireless EEG-based device that allows easy, rapid and automatic testing of face processing in newborns in any context, including their homes. This device is ground-breaking because it will combine the efficacy of our innovative experimental paradigm tailored to newborn’s restricted visual attention with a portable, low-power, wireless EEG device based on dry electrodes and an automatic algorithm that will extract on-line the EEG-based index of face processing. Its realization will enable the development of an early, objective and easy-to-test EEG-based biomarker on newborns at risk, potentially opening the way to large-scale screening protocols. Given the flexibility of the paradigm with respect to the content of the visual stimulation, this method might be used for research purposes to explore the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns.",
