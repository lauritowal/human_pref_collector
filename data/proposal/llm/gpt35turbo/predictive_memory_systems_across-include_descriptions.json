        "The proposed research project, PIVOTAL, aims to investigate the predictive coding framework as a fundamental principle of brain function. By examining how internal models in the brain generate predictions and adapt based on actual experiences, PIVOTAL seeks to uncover the nature of these models and how they are shaped over time. Additionally, the project aims to explore how prediction processes vary across different stages of the lifespan, from childhood to older adulthood, due to changes in cognitive development and neural architecture. \n\nThrough the integration of cognitive neuroscience research on predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development, PIVOTAL will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying predictive processing. Specifically, the project will focus on the role of episodic and semantic memory in shaping predictive processes in individuals of different age groups. By comparing children, younger adults, and older adults, PIVOTAL will shed light on how predictive processing evolves over the lifespan and how disruptions in these processes may lead to the emergence of disorders at different stages of life.\n\nThe findings from this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain operates as a prediction machine and how predictive processing is influenced by memory systems and age-related changes. Ultimately, PIVOTAL aims to provide valuable insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable adaptive behavior in our environment and may have implications for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders."

For this, the predictive coding framework emerges as a promising route, with the notion that the brain operates as a prediction machine; internal models in the brain predict future states against which incoming information of new experience is compared. This new conceptual framework leads to two essential empirical questions that PIVOTAL will tackle: (1) What is the nature of the internal models on which predictions are generated and how do our actual experiences shape them? (2) How do prediction processes play out in human brains that are inherently diverse due to changes such as those caused by maturation and senescence. Addressing these issues is important for advancing our basic understanding of the neurocognitive architectures that enable the brain to perform adaptively in our environment, with predictive processing as a fundamental operation. PIVOTAL will integrate three separate strands of cognitive neuroscience research on predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental research designs, we aim to unravel the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie predictive processing based on individualsâ€™ memory of prior experience (episodic memory) and well-learned knowledge about the world (semantic memory). These mechanisms will be systematically examined in samples of children, younger adults, and older adults, who differ from each other in important ways due to divergence in developmental orientation (progression vs. conservation) and neurocognitive landscape (structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits). By explicating a more dynamic version of the predictive brain principle, we can start addressing issues related to the emergence of disorders at particular time windows in life.",
