        "The BlockchainGov project aims to investigate the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures and power dynamics, addressing the erosion of trust in traditional institutions. This interdisciplinary research initiative will explore the governance of existing blockchain systems, analyze power dynamics, and assess the legitimacy of distributed governance models. By examining the potential of blockchain to support decentralized decision-making with transparency and accountability, the project seeks to identify new models of distributed governance. Through empirical research and theoretical analysis, the project will advance the field of \"distributed governance\" by integrating computer science, political science, and law. The ultimate goal is to experiment with these new models at various levels of governance, from local communities to global governance, with significant policy implications for global governance challenges. To achieve this ambitious vision, the project requires funding to support a dedicated and diverse research team with multidisciplinary expertise. This high-risk/high-gain initiative will contribute valuable insights to the broader discourse on global governance, shedding light on the potential of blockchain technology to reshape power structures and enhance legitimacy and trust in governance systems."

Often described as a “trustless” technology, blockchain’s potential for disintermediation has been touted as a catalyst of innovation that could displace existing power structures. But is it shifting power away from former centers of power only to create new ones, or can it lead to an actual new organisation of power? BlockchainGov is an interdisciplinary project that will study the impact of blockchain technology on new and existing governance structures, and its consequences for legitimacy and trust. First, it will investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, and analyse the power dynamics at play within these systems. Second, it will examine the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of existing attempts at distributed governance, through the lenses of legal and political theory. Third, it will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new models of distributed governance providing an architecture for decentralized and participatory decision-making with attributes of transparency and accountability. Last, it will experiment with these new models at different levels of governance, from the community level to the global governance level. The project will open a new field of scholarship on “distributed governance” that uniquely combines the disciplines of computer science, political science and law. It will provide key empirical and theoretical contributions to science, with important policy implications to the broader questions of global governance. Bringing this project to life requires a funding scheme compatible with a high-risk/high-gain vision to finance a fully dedicated and highly motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills.",
