        "The proposed grant project aims to create a comprehensive and detailed historical data set for 2500 Swedish administrative districts spanning the years 1749-1952. This unique data set will cover a wide range of variables including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments such as railway construction. The rich and disaggregated nature of this data will provide valuable insights into economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development over a 200-year period.\n\nWith a total potential number of observations reaching 0.5 million, this data set will allow for more robust empirical identification strategies including instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation. The historical data will enable researchers to explore various questions related to economic development and growth, as well as investigate issues such as redistribution of resources towards the poor in different types of democracies.\n\nBy leveraging the extensive and reliable historical data available in Sweden, this project has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of economic research. The ultimate goal is to enhance our understanding of the factors influencing economic development and growth, and to generate valuable insights that can inform future policy decisions."

The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction). The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500×T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size. This paper is currently “revise and resubmit” 2nd round at Econometrica. After collecting the new data, we intend to studying a number of questions related to economic development and growth.",
