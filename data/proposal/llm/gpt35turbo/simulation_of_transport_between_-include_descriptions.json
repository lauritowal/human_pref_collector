        "The proposed project, Roman Inland Transport Analysis and Dynamic Simulation (STRADA), aims to revolutionize our understanding of the impact of transportation on the Roman economy and the longevity of the Roman Empire. By combining cutting-edge technology with historical research, STRADA seeks to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system for both water and land transport routes between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube. This interdisciplinary approach will allow for a more accurate representation of transport times and routes, shedding light on the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe STRADA project will focus on three main objectives: studying the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, analyzing the influence of environmental factors on ancient transport systems, and introducing dynamic simulations into historical research. By reconstructing ancient land and water routes, conducting experimental performance tests under varying environmental conditions, and developing a time-related simulation system, STRADA will provide a comprehensive understanding of Roman transportation methods.\n\nThis research will have far-reaching implications, not only for our understanding of the Roman Empire but also for the broader field of historical research. The modular design of the simulation system will ensure its sustainability and allow for future extensions, making it adaptable to other time periods and geographical locations. STRADA has the potential to transform our knowledge of Roman transportation and its impact on the economy, offering valuable insights into the interconnectedness of ancient societies."

Therefore, it is an absolute desideratum to explore Roman inland transport transdisciplinary, combining recent technological developments with experimental data and profound historical research to gain the most realistic transport times. The objective of STRADA is the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system for water and land borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube. Thereby, STRADA is geared to three aims: a) the study of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, for gaining a better understanding of the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire, b) the analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system, c) and the introduction of dynamic simulations into historical research. For the implementation, the project will focus on three closely interwoven strands: The exact reconstruction of the ancient land- and water-routes, the experimental determination of the performance of the used land- and water-borne means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and the development of a time-related simulation system including local fine granular topography and historical weather data, different means of transport (water- and land-based) with different loads, the fatigue of the actors as well as necessary rests and loading times. STRADA will follow a modular design that will ease the sustainable use and a future extension of the simulation system. The chosen research area covers a wide range of landscapes from the Mediterranean lowlands, followed by different kinds of alpine regions, to a central European river landscape, which makes it easy adaptÂ¬able to other times and places.",
