        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Navigator\" which aims to investigate the impact of the proliferation of country performance indicators (CPIs) on global governance policy fields. The era of indicators has promised a revolution in policy-making by providing policymakers with better data to address global challenges. However, the abundance of CPIs on the same issue has resulted in increased complexity, ambiguity, and widespread use of CPIs with known shortcomings. The project will focus on four major policy fields: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness.\n\nInspired by the marketplace of ideas theory, Navigator will develop a novel framework to analyze how private and public bodies navigate policy fields populated with multiple indicators. The project will examine how users and producers adapt their practices over time in response to criticism of CPIs, diversity of CPIs, and competition within crowded policy fields. By shifting the focus from investigating the influence of a single CPI to examining how users and producers adapt to growing CPI competition and critique, Navigator aims to push the frontier of CPI research.\n\nThe project will contribute to a deeper understanding of how CPIs impact policy-making in global governance and provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in various policy fields."

States are now measured and ranked on a dizzying array of cross-cutting metrics. Prima facie, the era of indicators promises a revolution: armed with ever improving data, policymakers can better allocate scarce resources to address global challenges. Yet, the era of indicators generates a problem and a paradox: while each individual CPI strives to simplify complexity, an abundance of CPIs on the same issue multiplies complexity and thus generates ambiguity. Moreover, while it would be reassuring if we could assume only the soundest CPIs would thrive, many high-profile CPIs remain in widespread use despite well-known shortcomings.Crucially, the paradox begets a major puzzle that prior research has yet to consider: How do private and public bodies navigate policy fields populated with multiple indicators, each portending to measure the same phenomenon? Although prior research provides firm grounds to hope that CPI users and producers improve their practices over time, no studies have investigated whether they do. Rendering this gap tractable, Navigator investigates the “marketplace of indicators” in four major policy fields: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Navigator’s novel framework—inspired by the classic liberal theory of the marketplace of ideas—enables the systemic, longitudinal analysis of how users’ and producers adapt their practices over time: Whether users learn in light of criticism of their favoured CPIs, how they discern when faced with a diversity of CPIs; and how producers compete for users within crowded policy fields. In this way, Navigator would push the frontier of CPI research by conducting a systematic problem shift: from investigating a single CPI’s influence or limitations, to examining how users and producers adapt in the face of growing CPI competition and CPI critique.",
