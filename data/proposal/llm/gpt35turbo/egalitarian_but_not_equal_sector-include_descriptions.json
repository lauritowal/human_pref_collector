        "The proposed project, WAGE, aims to address the persistent gender pay gap (GPG) through an investigation into the gendered nature of collective bargaining in three key countries: Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Despite institutional measures aimed at reducing the GPG, women continue to earn significantly less than men in both feminized and male-dominated sectors. WAGE will utilize ethnographic research methods to compare the history of collective bargaining and the GPG in these countries, analyze daily practices in wage negotiations in the metal and nursing sectors, and document how actors in these sectors relate to wage norms and gendered differentials. This study will fill a gap in existing scholarship by exploring the economic relationship between gendered wage disparities and collective bargaining processes across different sectors. By shedding light on the mechanisms behind wage differentials, WAGE seeks to contribute to the broader effort to achieve gender equity in practice."

In countries explicitly committed to eliminating the gender pay gap (GPG), such as those in Europe, women still earn, on average, 13% less than men do (Eurostat, 2022). This is regardless of the fact that countries with persistent GPGs have deployed a strategic institutional measure to raise the wage floor of feminised work sectors and reduce the GPG – namely, collective bargaining. The overall aim of WAGE is to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining by investigating the past, the unruly present and the possible future of regulated collective bargaining processes in three key countries: Germany, Norway and Sweden. Moreover, the project’s research design will involve gathering data at the sectoral level of the metal sector and nursing and will use ethnographic research methods. To realise its overall aim, WAGE will accomplish the following three research objectives: 1. Compare and synthesise existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. 2. Uncover and analyse daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male dominated metal sector and the female dominated nursing sector. 3. Document and explain how actors embedded in the male dominated metal and the female dominated nursing sector relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. Given the dearth of scholarship on the relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes from an inter-sectoral angle, this study will be the first to systematically use qualitative methods to explore the economic frontier between sectoral gendered wage differentials and collective wage formation, thereby contributing to the effort to achieve gender equity in practice.",
