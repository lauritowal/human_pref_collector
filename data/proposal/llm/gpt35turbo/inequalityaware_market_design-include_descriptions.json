        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). The project will utilize a mechanism-design framework to identify the most effective way to structure markets, taking into account redistributive preferences induced by inequalities. The research will focus on testing the hypothesis that in situations where inequalities are pronounced and detectable based on agents' behavior, sacrificing allocative efficiency in favor of a more equitable split of surplus may be optimal. This approach provides a new perspective on addressing inequality in market design, offering insights on how policymakers concerned about inequality should navigate market interventions. By incorporating a redistributive objective into market design theory, this project aims to complement traditional mechanisms focused on efficiency and revenue, offering guidance on optimal allocation rules in market settings. Ultimately, the research will contribute to a better understanding of how marketplaces can be structured to address and mitigate inequalities, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers alike."

Yet, traditional economic intuition opposes these sorts of policies because—unlike well-functioning markets—they introduce allocative inefficiency. In this project, I will explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). My approach is to deploy a mechanism-design framework that identifies the optimal way to structure the market. In the baseline framework, the designer maximizes a welfare function whose welfare weights reflect her redistributive preferences induced by the inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information both about their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. Research will focus on testing the validity and scope of the main hypothesis: When inequalities are sufficiently pronounced and can be detected based on agents’ behavior in the market, it becomes optimal to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable split of surplus. For example, optimal market designs may involve inefficient rationing. Inequality-aware Market Design provides a novel way to address the growing problem of inequality in market-design settings. The redistributive objective distinguishes this theory from the traditional mechanism-design literature that has focused predominantly on efficiency and revenue as design goals; the focus on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace complements the public-finance approach to redistribution through the tax system. IMD provides policy guidance by explaining whether and how policymakers concerned about inequality should resort to distortionary market interventions.",
