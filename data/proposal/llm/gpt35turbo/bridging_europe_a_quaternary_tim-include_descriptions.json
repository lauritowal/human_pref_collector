        "The proposed project, EQuaTe, aims to revolutionize the field of archaeology by advancing the dating methods of amino acid and thermoluminescence (TL) dating to provide a comprehensive chronology of early human evolution and migration throughout Europe. The Quaternary period in Europe, characterized by significant climatic fluctuations and environmental changes, holds the key to understanding the evolution and movement of human populations throughout the region. By utilizing the unique properties of calcitic fossils (snail opercula) as repositories for amino acids and stable TL signals over Quaternary timescales, EQuaTe will establish a robust dating framework that spans the entire Palaeolithic era in Eurasia.\n\nThis pioneering research will address fundamental questions such as the timing of early human populations' expansion into Europe, the influence of climatic conditions on human cultural and population dynamics, and the factors contributing to differences in tool technologies across regions. By conducting a pan-European study that extends from Britain to the Black Sea, EQuaTe will provide a groundbreaking chronology that will enhance our understanding of past human societies and their interactions with the changing environment over the last 2.6 million years. The innovative approach of pairing amino acid and TL dating on the same biomineral represents a significant advancement in archaeological dating methods and has the potential to reshape our understanding of European prehistory."

During the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years), Europe witnessed major climatic oscillations, with periodic expansion of ice sheets into lowland areas, changes of sea-level, re-organization of plant and animal communities, and the evolution and migration of human populations. Despite extensive studies of the rich European geological and archaeological records (providing a detailed history of these environmental changes), these have little meaning without a secure chronology. Dating is extremely difficult beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~60,000 years). Key to our approach is the discovery that commonly-occurring calcitic fossils (snail opercula) provide both closed-system repositories for amino acids and a stable TL signal over Quaternary timescales. It is therefore now possible to use both dating methods on the same biomineral to build a strong dating framework; taking advantage of momentum in this field, EQuATe will apply this approach on a European scale. This novel paired chronology, spanning the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia, will refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change over the last 2.6 Ma, across a region stretching from Britain to the Black Sea. EQuaTe will provide the scientific means to answer critical questions, e.g.: when did early human populations expand into Europe, and under what climatic conditions? Are apparent differences in tool technologies a reflection of different species, technical evolution over time, or geographical variations in source materials and cultural tradition? The pan-European chronology developed by this research will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand our past.",
