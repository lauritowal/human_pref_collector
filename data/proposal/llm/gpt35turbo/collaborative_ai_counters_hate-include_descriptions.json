        "The proposed project aims to address the challenges facing AI-assisted extreme speech moderation by developing an innovative solution called \"AI4Dignity\". This project recognizes the limitations of current systems in detecting and removing online hate speech and disinformation due to inadequate training data sets and lack of cultural contextualization. The model will introduce a collaborative bottom-up coding approach that involves fact-checkers as key human intermediaries to bring cultural nuances into AI-assisted moderation processes.\n\nThe project will focus on developing a global comparative framework for AI solutions in extreme speech moderation, ensuring inclusivity and cultural sensitivity across different contexts. By facilitating collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries, the project seeks to establish procedural benchmarks for operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle. Additionally, an open access toolkit will be developed to enable the adoption of this model in various locations, promoting a community-based classification approach to enhance the effectiveness of AI systems in addressing digital hate and disinformation.\n\nThrough the implementation of AI4Dignity, this project aims to pave the way for more inclusive and culturally informed AI-assisted solutions that can effectively combat online extremism and disinformation, ultimately contributing to the preservation of democratic values in the digital age."

Governments, companies and civil society groups have responded to this phenomenon by increasingly turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool that can detect, decelerate and remove online extreme speech. However, such efforts confront many challenges. One of the key challenges is the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets. The second challenge is the lack of procedural guidelines and frameworks that can bring cultural contextualization to these systems. Lack of cultural contextualization has resulted in false positives, over-application and systemic bias. The ongoing ERC project has identified the need for a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions in order to address cultural variation, since there is no catch-all algorithm that can work for different contexts. Following this, the proposed project will address major challenges facing AI assisted extreme speech moderation by developing an innovative solution of collaborative bottom-up coding. The model, “AI4Dignity”, moves beyond keyword-based detection systems by pioneering a community-based classification approach. It identifies fact-checkers as critical human interlocutors who can bring cultural contextualization to AI-assisted speech moderation in a meaningful and feasible manner. The project will develop a replicable process model that will enable collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers and academic intermediaries in a facilitated event space. The project will develop an open access toolkit for the adoption of this model in different locations. AI4Dignity will be a significant step towards setting procedural benchmarks to operationalize “the human in the loop” principle and bring inclusive training datasets for AI systems tackling urgent issues of digital hate and disinformation.",
