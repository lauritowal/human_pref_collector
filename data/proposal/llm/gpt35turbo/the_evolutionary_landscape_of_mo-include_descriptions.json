        "The proposed research project NGIPALAJEM seeks to explore the origins of Homo sapiens within a deeper past context, dating back nearly three quarters of a million years ago. Focusing on the East African region, the project aims to expand the hominin fossil record through extensive fieldwork in Turkana, adding to recent discoveries. Additionally, NGIPALAJEM intends to enhance the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana and conduct eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic analyses to understand the evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities and the potential impact of human predation on African faunas. By analyzing the diverse range of hominin phenotypic diversity in the Middle Pleistocene period, the project will apply novel morphometric and analytical techniques to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The outcomes of NGIPALAJEM aim to provide a new perspective on how the evolution of Homo sapiens is intertwined with the broader and longer African evolutionary landscape, shedding light on key questions surrounding the origins of our species within a changing climatic and ecological context."

New fossils, dates and genomic studies have consolidated our African origin. Yet, they also indicate a deeper past, involving multiple events. These events stretch to nearly three quarters of a million years ago (Ma), and take the problem of modern human origins into an entirely different climatic and ecological context. From 1.4 Ma, climate dynamics changed, initiating a 1 million-year period (EMPT) during which, besides greater climatic variability, there is a prolonged arid phase, profoundly affecting African environments. By the end of the EMPT, the structure of the large mammal community in East Africa had changed significantly. The first modern humans are part of this change. The recognition of this older, drier context for the evolution of our species drives NGIPALAJEM. The proposed research aims to establish major empirical benchmarks to answer big questions. First, building on new hominin discoveries in Turkana, NGIPALAJEM will undertake extensive fieldwork to add more specimens to the scarce hominin fossil record of this period. Second, it will increase the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana, and carry out inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses to throw light on the wider evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities, and investigate the role human predation may have played in shaping modern African faunas. Third, new fossils, such as the new small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins that will be described as part of the project, show that the range of hominin phenotypic diversity in the MP is greater than expected, and so novel morphometric and analytical techniques will be applied to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The outcomes of NGIPALAJEM will bring a new understanding of how the evolution of our species is part of a broader and longer African evolutionary landscape.",
