        "This project aims to delve into the historical origins and development of the concept of ‘global psyche’ and transcultural psychiatry, offering valuable insights into the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health and illness. By conducting the first interdisciplinary analysis of the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, this research will provide a systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. It will explore how the concept of a universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of WWII and during decolonisation, as Western psychiatry sought to move beyond its colonial past and foster a more inclusive dialogue with non-Western mental health communities. By examining the efforts of psychiatrists worldwide to identify universal psychological mechanisms shared across cultures, this project will shed light on the historical forces that shaped this transformative period. Additionally, it will investigate how experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe contributed to redefining the relationship between culture, race, and individual psyche in the post-colonial era. Ultimately, this research will address critical questions surrounding the success of global and transcultural psychiatry in breaking away from colonial frameworks and developing new cross-cultural models of the mind."

It will offer the first historical analysis of the colonial and post-colonial roots of the current global mental health movement, and the first systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. It will argue that the concept of universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of WWII and during decolonisation, when Western psychiatry strove to leave behind its colonial legacies, and lay the foundation for a more inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities. In this period, leading psychiatrists across the globe set about identifying and defining the universal psychological mechanisms supposedly shared among all cultures (and 'civilisations'). I will explore this far-reaching psychiatric, social and cultural search for a new definition of 'common humanity', which developed in an increasingly inter-connected and culturally diverse global context, and examine the historical forces that drove it. I will also examine how the profession negotiated the tensions between researching cultural particularities and developing new, cross-cultural models of the mind. The project will answer some of the core questions related to this transformative period: How did psychiatrists and anthropologists from all over the world re-define the relationship between culture, race and individual psyche following the end of the Second World War and colonialism, what was the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in this transformative process, and did this new global and transcultural psychiatry succeed in departing from the erstwhile colonial frameworks?",
