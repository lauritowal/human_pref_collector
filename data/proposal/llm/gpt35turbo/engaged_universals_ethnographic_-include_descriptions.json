    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, \"Health for All,\" aims to conduct an anthropological study that investigates the implementation and engagement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries. UHC, defined by the WHO as ensuring access to necessary health services without financial hardship, has the potential to address longstanding issues of health inequality and lack of trust in national health-care systems. This research is crucial in the African context, where previous global health initiatives have failed to adequately address these challenges.\n\nBy focusing on key stakeholders at global, national, and local levels, the project will explore how UHC influences the relationship between states and citizens, the role of formal social protection systems, and the impact on informal health support networks. Through ethnographic fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level, the project will examine the complexities and frictions surrounding the implementation of UHC, shedding light on the contested nature of this global policy.\n\nThis research has the potential to contribute valuable insights into the intersection of public health, state responsibility, and social practices in African countries. By situating UHC within national histories and social contexts, the project will generate knowledge that is not only relevant to the African continent but also informs global discussions on health policy and the public good. Ultimately, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UHC in diverse socio-political contexts."

Defined by the WHO as ensuring that all people can use the health services they need without financial hardship, UHC is a powerful concept that approaches public health as a matter of justice and obligation and is included in the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC is particularly important in Africa, where structural-adjustment policies undermined state capacity, promoted privatization and pushed the burden of payment onto the poor. Recent global health initiatives have done little to address the neglect of national health-care systems and citizens’ lack of trust in them. In these contexts UHC is interesting because it reinserts questions of state responsibility and the public good into health-care. Historically however, African states have only partially pursued the public good, while in practice UHC is surrounding by conflicting interests. UHC is thus not a universal model but a contested field, making it an intriguing site for anthropological research. With a focus on actors and institutions at global, national and local levels in each country, the project will explore how moves towards UHC engage relations between states and citizens and universal concepts such as the public good; how UHC intersects with formal systems of social protection; and how it influences informal social networks that support health, thus situating UHC in national histories and social practices. Tracking the frictions surrounding UHC at the levels of policy-making, implementation, among beneficiaries, and in public debate, the project will use ethnographic methodology in innovative ways through fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level. The project’s focus on a global policy and the public good opens new research directions and will produce knowledge of relevance beyond Africa.",
