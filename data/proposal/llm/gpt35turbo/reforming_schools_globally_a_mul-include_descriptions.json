    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, REFORMED, seeks to address the global dissemination of school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies in education systems across different countries. With the rise of reform pressures to enhance the effectiveness of education systems, understanding the reasons behind the spread of SAWA policies and their impact on educational outcomes is crucial. Existing research has produced inconclusive findings on the effects of SAWA on learning outcomes and equity, highlighting the need for a comprehensive research approach.\n\nREFORMED aims to analyze the entire lifecycle of global education policy, from its inception on global agendas to its implementation and effects in various contexts. By examining how SAWA policies are adopted and adapted by different policy actors and exploring the institutional frameworks that influence the outcomes of these policies at the school level, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into the factors that shape the success of SAWA policies.\n\nA multi-scalar methodological strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, will be employed to advance this innovative approach. By shedding light on the mechanisms driving the global adoption of SAWA policies and their impact on education systems, the research conducted through REFORMED has the potential to inform policymakers and educators on how best to implement SAWA policies for improved educational outcomes worldwide."

In this scenario, managerial policy ideas such as school autonomy and accountability, which aim to modernize public education and strengthen its performance, are spreading broadly. To date, a wide range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development have adopted school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, whilst the most active international organizations in the education sector, like the OECD, are strongly promoting them globally. Constituting SAWA as a global model of education reform generates two main questions. First, why and how are SAWA policies disseminating globally, and to what extent does this reform model generate international policy convergence in education? Secondly, how and under what particular contextual and institutional circumstances do SAWA policies work and for whom? The fact that existing scholarly research has achieved inconclusive and mixed findings concerning the SAWA effects on learning outcomes and equity makes this second question especially relevant. To address these gaps in existing literature, REFORMED develops a comprehensive research approach that scrutinizes the different, but mutually constitutive stages of global education policy, from the inception in global agendas stage to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. Specifically, the project analyzes how and why SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors operating at different scales (from international bureaucrats to teachers), and inquires into the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that explain the different effects of SAWA at the school level. A robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods will contribute to advancing such an innovative approach.",
