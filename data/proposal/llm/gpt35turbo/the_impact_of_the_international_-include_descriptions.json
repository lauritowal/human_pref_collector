    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of eviction and its impact on individuals and society as a whole, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2011. The project aims to explore the interaction between national and international law in the context of evictions, focusing on the right to housing as enshrined in international and European law. By utilizing a data-driven approach, specifically citation network analysis and machine learning techniques, this research will examine the impact of the right to housing on case law from national supreme courts and lower level courts. The analysis of this vast amount of legal data will shed light on how international rights influence national laws, providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between international and national legal systems. This innovative approach, which has been called for but rarely executed in the legal discipline, has the potential to not only advance our understanding of the right to housing but also serve as a model for future research projects in other areas of law. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the protection of vulnerable populations facing eviction by providing empirical evidence of the impact of international legal norms on national legal systems."

During and after the financial crisis of 2007-2011, over 700,000 people in Europe either lost their homes or were at risk of losing them. National courts use national laws to rule on whether an eviction is just. However, the right to housing, as laid down in international and European law, often demands more protection of the power- and propertyless than national laws prescribe. As a result, national courts are at the centre of the complex interaction between national and international law. In times of growing national resistance towards international law, the questions whether, how, and why international law impacts on national law are among the most topical that legal scholars face. Evictions provide a timely opportunity to determine why international rights, such as the right to housing, may or may not have an impact on national law. The financial crisis has led to an enormous amount of case law (legal big data). The combination of the developed, but understudied, international right to housing and these vast amounts of national data offers a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between international law and national law. It is impossible to analyse all judgments manually. Therefore, I will use a data-driven approach that is unique in the legal discipline. Using citation network analysis, I conceptualise the right to housing as a network of international rights and conduct the first empirical analysis of the impact of this right in case law from national supreme courts and lower level courts. With the use of machine learning, I will identify predictors for courts’ decisions, and explain how these predictors may mirror the right to housing. This approach has long been called for but, so far, rarely been executed. If successful, it could be used in future research projects in other areas of the law.",
