        "The proposed project, NUCLEARWATERS, seeks to revolutionize the study of nuclear energy history by shifting the focus from nuclear physics to the role of water in the development of nuclear technology. By framing nuclear energy as a form of hydraulic technology, the project aims to uncover the deep historical connections between water manipulation practices and nuclear energy production. This innovative approach will shed light on the persistence of ancient water management techniques and risk conceptions in the nuclear age, potentially explaining the root causes of nuclear disasters and accidents. Through six distinct work packages, the project will explore the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the Soviet Union's nuclear waters, the impact of nuclearization on the Rhine Valley and Baltic Sea region, and Japan's atomic coastscapes. By revising existing narratives of nuclear energy history, NUCLEARWATERS has the potential to not only reshape the academic understanding of technology history but also inform public debates surrounding the future of nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. This project offers a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden historical logic behind nuclear disasters and accidents, paving the way for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between water and nuclear energy."

Rather than interpreting nuclear energy history as a history of nuclear physics and radiochemistry, it analyses it as a history of water. The project develops the argument that nuclear energy is in essence a hydraulic form of technology, and that it as such builds on centuries and even millennia of earlier hydraulic engineering efforts worldwide – and, culturally speaking, on earlier “hydraulic civilizations”, from ancient Egypt to the modern Netherlands. I investigate how historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions from a deeper past were carried on into the nuclear age. These risk conceptions brought with them a complex set of social and professional practices that displayed considerable inertia and were difficult to change – sometimes paving the way for disaster. Against this background I hypothesize that a water-centred nuclear energy history enables us to resolve a number of the key riddles in nuclear energy history and to grasp the deeper historical logic behind various nuclear disasters and accidents worldwide. The project is structured along six work packages that problematize the centrality – and dilemma – of water in nuclear energy history from different thematic and geographical angles. These include in-depth studies of the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, of the Soviet Union’s nuclear waters, of the Rhine Valley as a transnational and heavily nuclearized river basin, of Japan’s atomic coastscapes and of the ecologically and politically fragile Baltic Sea region. The ultimate ambition is to significantly revise nuclear energy history as we know it – with implications not only for the history of technology as an academic field (and its relationship with environmental history), but also for the public debate about nuclear energy’s future in Europe and beyond.",
