        "The proposed grant seeks to support the BECACO project, an innovative multidisciplinary initiative focused on redefining the study of provenance in ethnographic and archaeological collections. By shifting the traditional focus from individual objects or collectors to a broader examination of socio-politico-historical contexts, the project aims to introduce the concept of Art World Patterns. Through a combination of quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large dataset of provenance information, the project will explore new methodologies for large-scale provenance research. Specifically, the project will investigate the collecting of Indigenous Latin American material in Europe between 1850-2000, spanning 12 museums in 9 countries. By analyzing the formation of collections and the construction of discourse surrounding Indigenous Latin American art and aesthetics in Europe, the BECACO team will provide a comprehensive understanding of how these materials have been represented and interpreted. This ground-breaking research will contribute to the development of new models for provenance research in ethnographic and archaeological museums, with potential implications for the broader field of cultural heritage studies."

Moving away from the current focus in provenance research on single objects, collectors, or institutions, the aim of the project is to reconceptualize provenance as the large-scale study of the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material. To do so, it introduces the concept of Art World Patterns, an expansion and reframing of the idea of Art Worlds (Becker 2008[1982]). These patterns will be identified through an innovative combination of various data-driven methodologies. By applying quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data, the project will explore the promises and limitations of different data-driven approaches in the context of large-scale ethnographic/archaeological provenance research. Through this process, the project will devise new models for provenance research in ethnographic and archaeological museums. These conceptual and methodological advances will be mobilized through the study of Indigenous Latin American material from 12 museums in 9 countries. The project will create a ground-breaking diachronic, international, and cross-institutional understanding of the collecting of Indigenous Latin American material in Europe. In doing so, the BECACO team will reconstruct how – through the formation of collections – the Indigenous Latin American Art World as it existed in Europe between 1850-2000 constructed a discourse of art, aesthetics, and academic research that shaped how Indigenous Latin America is represented and understood in Europe until today.",
