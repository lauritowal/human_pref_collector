        "The RESCUE project seeks to explore how cultural practices in mainland China and Hong Kong navigate and resist intensified authoritarianism and rapid platformization through the lens of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema. This study will investigate the development of resilient tactics that enable social and political critique in the face of suppression. By focusing on indie music in Hong Kong, folk music in China, official and unofficial art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema, this project aims to develop a relational comparative analysis across different cultural fields and localities. Through an innovative methodological toolkit that combines ethnography with textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research, RESCUE will shed light on the (im)possibilities of critique in these contexts. Additionally, the project will establish a network of academics, cultural practitioners, and activists through workshops, podcasts, performances, screenings, and exhibitions to increase social impact. The findings of this research will not only showcase the diversity and vitality of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, challenging the notion of an omnipotent state, but also offer insights and connections to other regions facing similar challenges."

How to speak against power while being silenced? How to stay amidst suppression? RESCUE studies how cultural practices in the domains of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, in mainland China and Hong Kong, develop resilient tactics to express their social and political discontent. It theorises resilience and cultural critique in times of intensified authoritarianism and rapid platformization. Whereas such practices can resort to a history of experiences in China to negotiate a recently intensified authoritarianism, cultural practitioners in Hong Kong are facing a compressed authoritarianism – still searching for resilient tactics. RESCUE studies indie music in Hong Kong; folk music in China; the role of official and unofficial art institutes in China and Hong Kong; socially engaged art projects in rural and urban areas in China and Hong Kong; and queer cinema and queer film festivals in China and Hong Kong. It develops a relational comparative analysis between different cultural fields, and at different localities (Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianshui), to unpack the (im)possibilities of critique. RESCUE develops an innovative methodological toolkit, combining ethnography with textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research. RESCUE will establish and consolidate a network of academics, cultural practitioners, and activists in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, through multiple workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition – thereby increasing the social impact of the project. Findings will not only attest to the multivocality, diversity, and vitality of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, thus pushing back against the idea of the omnipotent Chinese state, but also inspire and forge connections to other localities facing a comparable predicament (e.g. Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey).",
