        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a research project exploring the unique and rich history of Ireland's cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome. Despite never being part of the Roman Empire, Ireland has a long-standing tradition of classical learning that is unparalleled in other northern European countries. Through an investigation of nine key diachronic themes such as language, land, travel, and material culture, the project aims to uncover why classical reception in Ireland is so exceptional. By adopting a multi-thematic approach, this research will foster interdisciplinary dialogue between fields such as classical reception studies, Irish history, literature, philosophy, and women's studies. Additionally, the project will examine how classical culture has influenced literary, social, and political discourse in Ireland, especially in light of the country's complex history and ongoing political divisions. Through this exploration, the project will provide new insights into the role of classical culture in shaping Irish identity and society, both historically and in the present day."

Unlike Britain and mainland Europe, Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire. Yet the island has an extraordinarily vibrant tradition of classical learning that dates back to its earliest recorded literature, and is unparalleled in other northern European countries. Research for this project will address why this is the case, by examining sources through nine significant diachronic themes identified by the PI: language; land; travel and exile; Troy; satire; Neoplatonism; female voices; material culture; and global influence. This multi-thematic approach will enable analysis of what is remarkable about classical reception in Ireland. It will also provide a heuristic framework that generates dialogue between normally disparate fields, such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English-language literature, Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project will engage with contemporary preoccupations surrounding the politics and history of the divided island of Ireland, such as the current decade of centenary commemorations for the foundation of an independent Irish state (1912-1922, 2012-2022), and the on-going violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. These issues will serve as a springboard for opening new avenues of investigation that look far beyond the past 100 years, but are linked to them. The project will thus shed new light on the role of classical culture in shaping literary, social, and political discourse across the island of Ireland, and throughout its history.",
