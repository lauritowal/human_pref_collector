        "My proposal aims to investigate the intricate relationship between genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual variations in substance use and the susceptibility to substance abuse. Substance use, including nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and caffeine, has both positive and negative health effects, depending on frequency and quantity. Utilizing extended twin family designs and DNA-variant data, I plan to uncover the genetic and environmental influences on substance use. Additionally, I will identify genes and gene networks related to substance use through gene expression patterns and investigate biomarkers in substance users compared to non-users. By linking twin-family data to national medical databases, I aim to explore the connection between substance use and health outcomes. Leveraging the resources of the Netherlands Twin Register and my extensive experience in behavior genetics and addiction research, I will lead this innovative project. My team will collect additional crucial data, and state-of-the-art methods will be employed to analyze the large samples available. Overall, this project will offer powerful insights into the complex interaction between genetics, environment, and substance use, paving the way for a better understanding of individual differences in substance use and the risk for abuse."

Substance use is common. Substances like nicotine and cannabis have well-known negative health consequences, while alcohol and caffeine use may be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on quantity and frequency of use. Twin studies (including my own) demonstrated that both heritable and environmental factors play a role. My proposal on substance use (nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and caffeine) is organized around several key objectives: 1. To unravel the complex contribution of genetic and environmental factors to substance use by using extended twin family designs; 2. To identify and confirm genes and gene networks involved in substance use by using DNA-variant data; 3. To explore gene expression patterns with RNA data in substance users versus non-users; 4. To investigate biomarkers in substance users versus non-users using blood or urine; 5. To unravel relation between substance use and health by linking twin-family data to national medical databases. To realize these aims I will use the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR); including both the longitudinal phenotype database and the biological samples. I have been involved in data collection, coordination of data collection and analyzing NTR data since 1999. With my comprehensive experience in data collection, data analyses and my knowledge in the field of behavior genetics and addiction research I will be able to successfully lead this cutting-edge project. Additional data crucial for the project will be collected by my team. Large samples will be available for this study and state-of-the art methods will be used to analyze the data. All together, my project will offer powerful approaches to unravel the complex interaction between genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in substance use and the risk for abuse.",
