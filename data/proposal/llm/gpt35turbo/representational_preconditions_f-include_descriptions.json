        "The proposed research project seeks to investigate the fundamental cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the early development of the human social mind. Building on recent evidence suggesting that infants as young as 7 months possess the ability to automatically compute others' beliefs, this project aims to further explore the implications of this groundbreaking discovery. Contrary to traditional theories positing that mental state representation is a late-developing and effortful capacity aimed at explaining behavior, our research proposes that these mechanisms are primarily automatic and grounded in real-time social interactions.\n\nBy systematically examining the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants' belief computation abilities, we hope to uncover a deeper understanding of the early representational preconditions and functional structure of the mechanisms dedicated to understanding other minds. Additionally, we aim to investigate how these abilities unfold over development and the role of collaborative and communicative interactions in shaping this dedicated system.\n\nThis innovative approach represents a paradigm shift in theory-of-mind research and has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the human social mind. Through a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, this project will contribute to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the cognitive and neural processes underlying social cognition in infancy."

We aim to explore and shed new theoretical light on the basic cognitive and brain mechanisms of the human social mind. One of these mechanisms that has received much attention by earlier approaches to ‘theory-of-mind’ research concerns the ability to infer and represent the mental states of others. Standard theories and research in the last twenty five years have suggested that representing other’s beliefs is an effortful and late developing capacity (Wellman et al., 2001) whose main function is to explain others’ behavior. Here we advance and propose to explore a new theoretical perspective according to which the mechanisms of mental state monitoring and representation involve primarily automatic and effortless processes grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Our approach is part of an on-going paradigm change in the field of theory-of-mind research motivated by the recent evidence showing that infants in their second year understand mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). Our own research has gone a significant step further by demonstrating that these mechanisms are present as early as 7 month of age, and by showing that both young infants and adults seem to automatically compute others’ beliefs even in situations where they are not required to do so (Kovács et al, in press Science). The present project explores the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants’ powerful belief computation abilities and to chart their developmental unfolding. Furthermore, we shall explore the implications of the new theoretical proposal that this dedicated system presupposes as its proper domain the on-going collaborative and communicative interactions.",
