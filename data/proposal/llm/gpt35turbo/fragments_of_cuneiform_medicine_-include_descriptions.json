        "The BabMed grant proposal seeks to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform, focusing on the largest ancient collection of medical data before Hippocrates. This study aims to bridge the gap between cuneiform and Aramaic medical texts found in the Babylonian Talmud, which have not been systematically studied together. BabMed will test two key hypotheses: that cuneiform survived longer than previously believed, and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud is largely derived from Akkadian medicine. By utilizing native taxonomies rather than modern classifications, BabMed will challenge existing Eurocentric views on the history of medicine, particularly the dominance of Greek medicine as the standard for ancient medical practices. The project will explore how Babylonian medicine transcended script and language barriers, proposing that it survived in Aramaic within the Babylonian Talmud. BabMed aims to introduce a new paradigm for understanding the transfer of knowledge in ancient medical systems, shedding light on the scientific thinking of both Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia."

The latest phase of Babylonian medicine, as preserved in Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud, has never been systematically studied in the light of older cuneiform materials. The absence of accessible cuneiform medical literature has forced recent medical histories to bypass Babylonian medicine, while Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has simply been ignored. BabMed tests a number of 'high risk' propositions, including two key hypotheses: 1) cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected, and 2) Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. BabMed's methodology relies upon native taxonomies rather than modern biomedical disease classifications, countering flawed retrospective diagnoses that obviate the entire history of medicine. Comparisons with neighbouring medical systems challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories, in which Greek medicine has become the standard for all ancient medicine. BabMed will introduce a new paradigm for knowledge transfer which will recognise the barriers between ancient arts of medicine and how they were overcome in antiquity. One such barrier was script and language, and BabMed proposes that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text which straddles the borders of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia and mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds.",
