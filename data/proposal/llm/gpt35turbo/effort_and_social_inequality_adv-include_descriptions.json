        "This grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the impact of effort on the reproduction of social inequality, a crucial yet understudied aspect in the field of intergenerational mobility. The project aims to address three key research questions: 1. How do children's effort levels vary based on parental socioeconomic background? 2. Can differences in effort by social background be attributed to the transmission of effort from parents to children, as well as varying motivations and responses to incentives? 3. What are the most effective methods for measuring cognitive effort and how do these techniques compare across different scientific disciplines? By utilizing innovative methods such as real-effort tasks and pupillometry, the project will collect experimental data from a large sample of school-age children and parents in Spain and Germany, complemented by analysis of subjective effort dispositions from national surveys. Through triangulating these methodologies, the study aims to provide reliable evidence on socioeconomic disparities in effort and open avenues for future research on gender and ethnic differentials. Not only will the findings inform educational practices, but they will also contribute to policy discussions on social inequality and support evidence-based policy design."

While large-scale test programs like PISA have produced impressive amounts of data on the determinants of cognitive abilities, there is scant evidence on socio-economic differences in cognitive effort. Better understanding the social origins of effort pushes the frontier of knowledge on intergenerational mobility and allows improving equality of opportunity. Specifically, the aim of the project is to answer three research questions: 1. To what extent do childrenâ€™s effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background? (descriptive component) 2. Can existing disparities in effort by social background be explained by (a) the intergenerational transmission of effort from parents to children, and (b) varying motivations and differential susceptibility to incentives? (analytical component) 3. What are the best techniques to measure cognitive effort and what are the strengths and weaknesses of measures routinely used in different scientific disciplines? (methodological component) The project will develop and exploit cutting-edge methods of effort measurement such as real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry. Their immense potential has remained untapped in inequality research thus far. Experimental data will be collected for a large sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. Subjective effort dispositions will be further analyzed using (inter)national surveys. The triangulation of carefully chosen methodologies will provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and stimulate new research (e.g. on gender or ethnic differentials in effort). Cross-validation analysis will detect possible biases of commonly used effort measures. The research findings will provide valuable insights for educational practitioners and decisive evidence for normative debates about social inequality and policy design.",
