        "This grant proposal seeks funding to support groundbreaking research aimed at challenging the dominant alphabet-centric approach to language understanding. The project aims to shift the focus from word and letter-based systems to the low-level properties of the acoustic signal in speech. Drawing on the researcher's work with wide learning networks, which closely mimic human processing capabilities, the study will investigate how languages use acoustic properties to reduce uncertainty in message encoding. The proposed research will expand the scope of the study to include a more diverse range of languages, delve into speech production processes, and develop a discrimination-based language theory. By examining the strengths and weaknesses of human learning through algorithms that mirror human capacity, this study seeks to advance our understanding of language comprehension and production. This research is crucial as machine learning and artificial intelligence push beyond human capabilities, emphasizing the need to explore alternative approaches to language processing. The grant funding will enable the researcher to further develop this innovative research program and contribute to a paradigm shift in linguistic studies."

Do not include information not available in the description below. Do not directly plagiarize the description below.\n\nPlease limit the response to 269 words or less.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nAlthough homo sapiens has been endowed with language for over 50,000 years, the invention of alphabet-like scripts 3,000 years ago dominates Western linguistic thinking. Training in literacy starts in early childhood, and because of this, words and letter-like sound units can naturally seem to be the building blocks of language. The Chinese writing system highlights the cultural-specificity of this approach: characters are juxtaposed without intervening spaces, and their interpretation is highly context-dependent. Words are not singled out. And although more frequent characters contain parts indicating pronunciation, it is syllables that are referred to, not letter-like sound units. The research proposed here seeks to break the hold that the alphabet-centric approach has on our understanding of language by exploring the idea that instead of being phone and word-based, languages use low-level properties of the acoustic signal to directly reduce uncertainty about the messages encoded in the speech signal. My work with wide learning networks (two-layer networks with many thousands of units, using the simplest possible error-driven learning rule) provides remarkable support for this suggestion: For reading and speech comprehension, their performance closely matches both the strengths and the weaknesses of human processing. Especially at a time when machine learning and artificial intelligence are moving beyond human capacity, it is a methodological imperative to study and work with algorithms reflecting both the advantages and disadvantages of human learning. I am requesting funding to take this radically novel research program to the next level by further developing our account of auditory comprehension, by modeling more typologically diverse languages, by extending this approach to speech production, and by developing a discrimination-based language theory.",
