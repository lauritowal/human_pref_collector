        "The proposed project, titled INNOVATION, seeks to revolutionize current scholarly understanding of the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by exploring the pioneering nature of early thirteenth-century Franciscan thought. Despite being overlooked in academic circles, early Franciscan thinkers played a pivotal role in shaping the Western philosophical identity. This study aims to challenge the assumption that early Franciscans merely codified the work of past authorities, while later Franciscans developed innovative ideas that laid the foundation for modern philosophy. By conducting the first comprehensive study of the sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought, this project will implement a groundbreaking 'practice-led' hermeneutic method of reading scholastic texts. This approach will shed light on the novelty present in early Franciscan thought, often stemming from the use of Islamic sources, and reveal previously unnoticed connections between early and late Franciscan schools. By highlighting the influence of a specific religious order and Islamic thought on Western philosophical development, this project aims to bridge cultural divides and offer a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought. Ultimately, this research will contribute significantly to the field by providing a fresh perspective on the evolution of Western philosophy and the interconnectedness of diverse intellectual traditions."

This breakthrough will be achieved by exposing the pioneering nature of early thirteenth-century Franciscan thought and its pivotal significance for the subsequent formation of the Western philosophical identity. The work of early Franciscans has largely been neglected in scholarly circles, on the assumption that they merely codified the work of past authorities, where later Franciscans developed innovative ideas that laid the foundation for the development of modern philosophy. INNOVATION will contest this assumption by producing the first comprehensive study of the sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought. In conducting this study, I will implement a groundbreaking method of reading scholastic texts, which is attentive to the way that practice informed theory in the high Middle Ages. This ‘practice-led’ hermeneutic will provide a resource for re-envisaging the entire state of the art in the study of scholasticism. As regards early Franciscans, it will allow me to identify novelty, often due to the use of Islamic sources, where past scholars have perceived unoriginality. On this basis, I will highlight previously unnoticed connections between the early and late Franciscan schools. By these means, I will illustrate how Western thought has been nourished by the ethos of a particular religious order and by Islamic thought, pointing up a shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity that is often overlooked but urgently needed to overcome severe fractures in today’s society. At the same time, I will emphasize that Franciscan ideas only became modern once removed from their practice-led context. In juxtaposing the cultural paradigms of philosophy and religious practice, consequently, I will advance knowledge by producing the first nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought.",
