        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a research project focusing on the experiences of boat refugees across different time periods and geographic regions. The project will explore the themes of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary as they relate to the journeys of boat refugees, drawing on historical examples such as Jewish boat refugees in the 1940s and Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s and 1980s. The central research question guiding this project is how these notions influenced the experience and reception of boat refugees. The research team will also investigate who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why. The project will examine whether there was solidarity among boat refugees, whether they received help from non-state actors such as merchant vessels and NGOs, how states responded to them at sea, and whether they were able to find sanctuary after their journey. This project aims to break new ground by focusing on the role of the sea, looking beyond the state, and comparing the experiences of boat refugees across different contexts. The research will be based on interviews with boat refugees and other actors, oral history, archival sources, legal cases, and media coverage. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by boat refugees and the responses they receive from various actors."

This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 198In 2015, over one million boat refugees sailed across the Mediterranean. This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 1980s and 1990s, Cubans and Haitians tried to navigate the Caribbean to reach the US; and in the 1990s and 2000s, boat refugees sailed across the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Australia, Yemen, and Europe respectively. The central research question framing this project is: how did notions of solidarity, sovereignty and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? The research team will be guided by the related sub-question: who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? Each of the sub-projects will examine a) whether there was solidarity onboard between boat refugees, b) whether boat refugees encountered solidarity from non-state actors, such as merchant vessels, fishing boats and NGO search and rescue missions, c) how states responded to boat refugees at sea, and d) whether boat refugees attained sanctuary after their journey. This projectâ€™s ground-breaking character lies in three aspects: 1) thinking through seas, 2) going beyond the state, and 3) comparing the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space. The main sources that the project will rely upon will be interviews with boat refugees, non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage.",
