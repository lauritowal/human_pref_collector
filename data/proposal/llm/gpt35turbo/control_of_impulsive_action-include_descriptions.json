        "This grant proposal seeks to address the fundamental questions surrounding impulse-control mechanisms and their implications for clinical and behavioural disorders. The proposed research program aims to investigate the origins and control of impulsive actions through the development of new models that integrate different aspects of impulsive action and executive control. By utilizing carefully designed behavioural paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (such as TMS & EEG), physiological measures (e.g. facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, this study will answer five key questions: (1) Can novel impulsive actions arise during task-preparation stages?; (2) What is the role of negative emotions in the origin and control of impulsive actions?; (3) How does learning modulate impulsive behavior?; (4) When are impulsive actions (dys)functional?; and (5) How is variation in state impulsivity associated with trait impulsivity? Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a new behavioral model of impulsive action that can replace the current dominant 'inhibitory control' models and provide a more comprehensive understanding of impulsivity and control. This innovative approach will not only advance the field of impulsive action but also contribute to insights into individual differences in impulsivity and associated disorders."

Failures to regulate impulsive actions have been associated with a variety of clinical and behavioural disorders. Therefore, establishing a good understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and how to improve them could be hugely beneficial for both individuals and society at large. Yet many fundamental questions remain unanswered. This stems from a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory control and well-practiced actions. To make significant progress, we need to develop new models that integrate different aspects of impulsive action and executive control. The proposed research program aims to answer five fundamental questions. (1) Can novel impulsive actions arise during task-preparation stages?; (2) What is the role of negative emotions in the origin and control of impulsive actions?; (3) How does learning modulate impulsive behaviour?; (4) When are impulsive actions (dys)functional?; and (5) How is variation in state impulsivity associated with trait impulsivity? To answer these questions, we will use carefully designed behavioural paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (e.g. facial EMG), and mathematical modelling of decision-making to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions. Our ultimate goal is to transform the impulsive action field by replacing the currently dominant ‘inhibitory control’ models of impulsive action with detailed multifaceted models that can explain impulsivity and control across time and space. Developing a new behavioural model of impulsive action will also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of individual differences in impulsivity and the many disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.",
