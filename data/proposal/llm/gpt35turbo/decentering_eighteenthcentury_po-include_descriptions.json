        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project that aims to reexamine the early history of European political economy. While traditional historical narratives have focused on the evolution of modern economics, this project takes a new approach by viewing political economy as a discourse aimed at enhancing human well-being, a key element of Enlightenment thought. By delving into a wide range of contemporary literature on growth, wealth, and welfare, the project seeks to uncover a more nuanced understanding of eighteenth-century political economy. Through a primary case study of the Swedish empire, seen as a hub of 'oeconomia', the project will explore practical concerns and policies for improvement rather than simply translating past arguments into modern economic terms. By examining key concepts such as wealth, growth, and welfare in various institutional settings, including universities, governmental bodies, and academic journals, the project aims to shed light on how these ideas were articulated and applied in early modern Europe. Ultimately, this project offers a fresh perspective on the emergence of economic discourse in the eighteenth century, providing valuable insights into the ways in which political economy shaped state and society during this period."

Historians of political economy have traditionally concentrated on the genesis of modern economics, tracing the emergence of economic models, methods and ideas that are today recognized as 'economics' through 'classical political economy', neo-classicism and on to the present. This new departure treats political economy as a discourse oriented to the improvement of conditions for human life and, as such, one of the Enlightenment’s key contributions to Western thought. However, any direct association of Enlightenment discourse with political economy requires qualification. Therefore, this project explores a very extensive contemporary literature about growth, wealth and welfare that has not fitted easily into the conventional retrospective history. Instead of converting past arguments into modern arguments about methods and models, the project investigates eighteenth-century political economy in terms of practical concerns, as measures and policies for betterment and improvement. Only in this way we can reconstruct what political economy meant to its contemporaries in the early modern period. The Swedish empire – considered by contemporaries as the stronghold of 'oeconomia' – functions as the primary case study, but is constantly compared with other cases, broadening the applicability of the findings. The aim of the project is to study the ways in which the key concepts of improvement – wealth, growth and welfare – were articulated in the main sites of discursive production: the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The study of the five institutions is based on the hypothesis that in each of them activities were directed towards improving the organisation of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project represents a well-founded reassessment of the rise to predominance of economic argument during the eighteenth century.",
