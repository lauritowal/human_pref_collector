        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project that will utilize digital humanities tools to investigate research practices in particle physics at CERN. By analyzing the internal communication of large scientific collaborations using born-digital documents, such as emails and internal wiki pages, this project aims to enhance our understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in these settings. The overarching goal is to develop historiographic guidelines that can be applied to future studies of modern scientific collaborations, contributing to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation and network epistemology. \n\nHistorically, studies of research practices at CERN have been limited to published articles, interviews, and participant observation. This project aims to fill a gap in the field by utilizing digital tools and computational methods to capture and analyze large-scale research processes. By doing so, we hope to provide a comprehensive view of research practices in particle physics and beyond, offering new insights into the epistemological aspects of scientific collaboration. This project will not only contribute to the history and philosophy of science, but will also provide practical strategies for utilizing born-digital sources in future research. Through this innovative approach, we aim to advance our understanding of how knowledge is produced and validated in collaborative scientific endeavors."

The project will focus on an investigation of recent research practice in particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in order to gain a better understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in very large scientific collaborations. The main working hypothesis of the project is that collective research processes can be characterized, in epistemologically relevant terms, through a bird’s eye view analysis of the collaboration’s internal communication. The internal communication will be reconstructed from born-digital documents (e-mails, internal wiki pages, etc.) which accrue in the research practice of the collaboration. Abstracting from the case study, the project will also develop historiographic guidelines that can be transferred to future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations. Last but not least, the project will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, in particular to recent issues in “network epistemology”, by adapting the theoretical models to better fit important real-world cases. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to capture large-scale and complex research processes, such as the ones at CERN, and make them accessible for epistemological analysis. Almost all the studies of the research practice at CERN or similar cases have so far been restricted to the analysis of published articles, selected interviews and participant observation. Accompanied by historiographic guidelines and practical strategies (both of which are lacking at the moment) for best practices in the history and philosophy of science based on born-digital sources, the application of digital tools and computational methods may finally help us attain a maximally comprehensive picture of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond.",
