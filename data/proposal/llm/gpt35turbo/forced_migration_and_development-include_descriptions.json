        "The global forced migration crisis, with 68.5 million individuals displaced due to violence, conflict, and natural disasters by 2016, has predominantly impacted developing countries. However, there is a significant gap in understanding the economic consequences of forced migration in these nations. The FORCEDMIGDEV project aims to address this gap through a comprehensive analysis of internal displacement and international migration. \n\nThe first part of the project involves developing a structural model to examine the long-term impacts of refugee inflows in developing countries, with a focus on the effects of Syrian refugees in Turkey. By answering critical questions about distributional effects, welfare impacts, and the effects of legal status for refugees, this research will provide valuable insights for both developing and developed host countries.\n\nThe second part of the project will utilize reduced-form and structural methods to investigate the effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement and its implications for economic development. Leveraging unique data from Brazil, the study will estimate the effects of internal displacement on various outcomes at the destination and develop a quantitative spatial model to assess equilibrium effects, congestion, agglomeration externalities, and labor market frictions. By exploring the intersection of climate and development economics, this research has the potential to pave the way for new avenues of inquiry in the field."

This crisis is vastly concentrated in developing countries, which host 85% of the world’s displaced population. Nevertheless, we still know relatively about the economic consequences of forced migration in these countries. FORCEDMIGDEV seeks to fill this gap. It is organised in complementary parts that analyse the two dimensions of forced migration – internal displacement and international migration (refugees) – which constitute very different economic phenomena. The first part develops a structural model to analyse the long-run impacts of refugee inflows in developing countries. The model is estimated and used to investigate the effects of the Syrian refugees in Turkey, the largest host country in the world. I am able to answer questions that are relevant for developing but also developed host countries. What are the distributional effects of refugee shocks? What are the welfare effects across regions? What are the effects of providing refugees with a legal status? The second part combines reduced-form and structural methods to investigate the effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement and its impacts on economic development. I take advantage of unique data availability in Brazil to estimate the reduced-form effects of internal displacement on a broad array of outcomes at destination. I then move to develop a novel quantitative spatial model that captures the equilibrium effects in origin and destination regions, while accounting for congestion and agglomeration externalities and labour market frictions. I estimate the model and use it to assess the long-run, micro and macro effects of internal displacement in Brazil. This part lies on the under-explored intersection of climate and development economics, which has a large potential to open new avenues for future research,",
