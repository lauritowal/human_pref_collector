        "The proposed project aims to create a comprehensive campaign focused on collecting, editing, and conducting historical-linguistic research on personal letters from the Early Modern Ages (17th to early 19th century) in Portugal and Spain. These original epistolary writings provide a unique insight into the lives and interactions of a diverse range of individuals, including servants, children, wives, lovers, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, among others. These letters, often seized by the Inquisition and civil courts as evidence, are accompanied by sociological interviews conducted by inquisitors and judges, offering a well-contextualized view of traditional communities and interpersonal relationships.\n\nThis project seeks to assemble a large collection of these personal letters to provide researchers with a deeper understanding of Early Modern 'popular' discourse. By utilizing Textual Criticism standards, the project will create an online digital edition of these documents, enabling cultural and linguistic studies of their contents. Through this initiative, the project aims to shed light on the emotions, beliefs, and daily experiences expressed in these letters, contributing to a richer understanding of historical communities and societal norms during this period."

The documents in question are original epistolary writings made by servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, political fighters, and many other types of social agents whose paths were crossed by the prosecuting ways of the Inquisition and the civil courts, two institutions that used to seize personal correspondence as instrumental proof. Since the documents are accompanied by the ‘sociological interviews’ carried out by inquisitors and judges, they allow researchers a well-contextualized study of traditional communities in their inter-personal modes of relation. The sources’ texts contain very frequently an (almost) oral rhetoric through which emotions were expressed, commonsense was stated, non-orthodox beliefs were confessed and trivial incidents were narrated. Until now, it has been difficult to discover more than thin samples of this Early Modern ‘popular’ discourse. The P.S. project will not only assemble a large collection of it, but it will also match its philological treatment – an online digital edition following Textual Criticism standards – with the cultural and linguistic study of its contents.",
