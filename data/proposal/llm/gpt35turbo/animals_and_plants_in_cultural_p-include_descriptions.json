        "The proposed project, titled ECO, seeks to explore the representation of animals and plants in cultural productions about the Amazon region. The central hypothesis of the project is that these texts, films, and artworks demonstrate the dynamic relationship between non-human beings and human cultural life. Through the concept of zoophytography, ECO aims to decenter humanity as the sole source of meaning-making by analyzing how animals and plants are portrayed in various forms of cultural expression. \n\nThe research will be conducted in three main streams: \"Amazonian Zoophytography\" will define and trace the roots of this concept in Indigenous and Western philosophies; \"Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out\" will focus on the articulation of animals in cultural productions; and \"Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations\" will analyze the portrayal of plant life in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nBy delving into these cultural representations, ECO aims to make a significant contribution to the environmental humanities by offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. Through this research, the project hopes to deepen our understanding of the interdependence between humans and non-humans, shed light on environmental degradation in the Amazon region, and promote more equitable views on the fauna and flora of the area."

The key hypothesis of ECO is that texts (broadly understood to include mythology, folk tales, the lyrics of songs, essays, literature, travel writings, etc.), cinema and art about this area highlight the ways in which non-human beings dynamically shape human cultural life. The project’s main challenge is to resort both to Amazonian thought and to the academic field of ecocriticism to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants. ECO develops the concept of zoophytography to describe the inscription of non-humans in texts, films and artworks, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making. Research stream I. “Amazonian Zoophytography” formulates a definition of this notion and traces its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies and to Western philosophy. Through archival research, ECO will then gather and analyze sources that portray Amazonian animals and plants from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards in two other research streams: II. “Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out” focuses on the articulation of animals in cultural productions about the Amazon; III. “Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations” analyzes plant inscription in texts, cinema and artworks that question the role of vegetal life as a passive form of existence. ECO will make a significant contribution to the environmental humanities, offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy and post-colonial studies. By creating a deeper understanding of conceptions of Amazonian fauna and flora, the project will reveal the interdependence of humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia and uncover more equitable views on animals and plants from the region.",
