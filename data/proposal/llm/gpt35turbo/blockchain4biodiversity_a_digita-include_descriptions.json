    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the issue of dwindling economic incentives for farmers to cultivate and conserve indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK) in situ. Through the development and testing of a technical specification for a digital farmers’ market called ReSeed, this project aims to facilitate traceable transfers of ISK in a decentralized and transparent manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, the proposed solution will enable the tracking of the flow of ISK from the first farmer to end-users or downstream research, incentivizing honest reporting and acknowledging the value of farmers’ contributions.\n\nUsing a mixed methods research approach, this project will involve original empirical research with ISK suppliers and buyers to co-compile technical features and incentives for ReSeed’s design. Additionally, the proposal includes plans for integrating ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks, creating a governance model, and establishing ethics guidelines for its adoption in small farmers’ communities. Through these efforts, ReSeed aims to promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, ultimately bringing economic and environmental benefits to small farmers. This project builds upon the researcher’s extensive experience in incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds, offering a novel solution to support farmers in preserving and benefiting from their ISK."

Do not include information not available in the description below.

While indigenous seeds can be preserved in seed banks, problems of viability over prolonged storage and rapid climate change necessitate on-farm (in situ) conservation. However, farmers face dwindling economic incentives to cultivate and thereby conserve ISK in situ: ISK is ineligible for protection under intellectual property laws and there are currently no systems in place for tracking the end use to which ISK are put (e.g. end-user consumption or downstream research). The fundamental problem here is in tracing who the first farmer (group) was that put an ISK on the “market”, who accessed it, and what was done with it. Using features of blockchain technology that can help track the flow of ISK in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way, my goal is to develop and test a technical specification for a first-of-its-kind digital farmers’ market (ReSeed) that (i) facilitates equitable and traceable transfers of farmers’ ISK, and (ii) incentivizes honest reporting-back of downstream research and innovation therewith. Using a mixed methods research approach, I will conduct original empirical research with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that will inform ReSeed’s design. I will also demonstrate how ReSeed can be integrated into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments, and create a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers’ communities. ReSeed will build on my 12-year research on means of incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds. It will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers’ ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.",
