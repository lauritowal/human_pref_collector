        "The proposed project, \"Antarctic Marine Spatial Planning for Sustainability and Climate Adaptation (PLAnT),\" aims to address the critical gap in current marine spatial planning (MSP) initiatives by explicitly integrating climate change considerations. With Antarctica being the only ocean basin without formal MSP development, the need for sustainable and climate-smart planning in this rapidly changing region is more pressing than ever. PLAnT will assess social-ecological vulnerabilities, develop future scenarios, support area-based climate action, analyze governance structures, and promote a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity under changing environmental conditions. \n\nWhile solutions identified in PLAnT may be context-specific due to the complex nature of social-ecological systems, the project will serve as a model for other nations seeking to implement climate-smart MSP initiatives. By addressing the challenges hindering the development of climate-smart MSP in Antarctica and globally, PLAnT will inspire nations to adopt dynamic solutions that support ocean sustainability in the face of climate change. This groundbreaking project comes at a crucial time when ocean sustainability is at the forefront of the international agenda, making it imperative to take bold steps towards climate adaptation in marine spatial planning."

However, few existing marine spatial planning (MSP) initiatives consider climate change explicitly. This is a critical oversight in a rapidly changing world. At the same time, no formal MSP initiatives are envisioned for Antarctica; it is the only ocean basin globally without MSP under development. Antarctica is changing rapidly with potential repercussions around the planet, particularly for sea-level rise, climate regulation, and marine ecosystems functioning. Developing integrated, sustainable MSP for Antarctica is now more fundamental than ever. Excluding climate effects from MSP will lead to plans that are maladaptive and inefficient in sustaining marine ecosystems and their use under change. By contrast, if designed with climate objectives, MSP can provide substantial benefits while requiring few trade-offs. Efforts must be thus put together to effectively move towards climate-smart MSP in Antarctica and globally. Yet, contextual idiosyncrasies (political, social, economic) limit the effectiveness of such efforts. Understanding what challenges hinder the development of climate-smart MSP, in Antarctica and globally, and pointing ways to overcome such challenges is key. PLAnT will take up, for the very first time, such critical task. It will assess social-ecological vulnerabilities; build future scenarios; support area-based climate action and dynamic solutions; conduct governance analyses; and foster a paradigm shift on how to plan for sustainability and equity under change. Research on complex social-ecological systems rarely leads to one-size solutions, and there is a risk that solutions identified in PLAnT are context specific. Still, PLAnT will inspire nations worldwide to finding pathways and solutions to support ocean sustainability. At a time when the latter is firmly established in the international agenda, taking a leap forward on this topic is ground-breaking.",
