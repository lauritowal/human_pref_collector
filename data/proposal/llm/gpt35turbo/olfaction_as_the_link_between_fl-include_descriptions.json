        "The proposed project, OLFLINK, aims to address the urgent global health and sustainability goal of changing human diets by investigating the processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth. By uncovering the mechanisms that transfer appetitive properties of odors from the mouth onto environmental objects, this research will provide insight into the acquisition and retrieval of new flavor preferences. Through three nested levels of investigation, OLFLINK will determine the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations, delineate the cortical control mechanisms that facilitate encoding and retrieval of these associations, and investigate the interactions with digestive feedback that regulate this flexible coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval. \n\nBy bridging the gap between mechanisms driving perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the outside world, OLFLINK has the potential to transform our understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. The insights gained from this research have the potential to inspire the development of novel interventions to facilitate dietary changes over the life course, ultimately contributing to improved global health outcomes and sustainable food practices."

Odor-taste associative learning is the principal perceptual support process for flavor preference formation and retrieval. Mechanistic insight into the cortical processes that transfer appetitive properties of an odor from the mouth onto environmental objects is, however, almost completely absent. As a result, fundamental questions about the processes that drive the acquisition of new flavor preferences, and their regulation by signals from the digestive tract, still remain to be answered. OLFLINK will uncover processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth across three nested levels of investigation that are usually studied in separation. In doing so, I propose to discover key factors that facilitate or hinder acquisition of new flavor preferences. Specifically, I will 1: determine the distributed CODE by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (WP1), 2: delineate the cortical CONTROL mechanisms that facilitate encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations in the light of contextual variability (WP2), and 3: determine the interactions with digestive feedback that REGULATE this flexible coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (WP3). This final step especially provides insight into the bodyâ€™s ability to adjust learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and has potential to transform our thinking about the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. The novel insights from OLFLINK will fill the knowledge gap that currently exists between the mechanisms driving perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the outside world, and will inspire the development of novel interventions to facilitate dietary changes over the life course.",
