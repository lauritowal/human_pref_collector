        "The DEMOLAW project seeks to explore the intricate relationship between the design, creation, and longevity of legislation in democratic systems. By analyzing legislative texts from the US, UK, and EU using cutting-edge computational methods, this project aims to address three key research questions. Firstly, it aims to identify the conceptual dimensions that influence the design of laws and develop a method to measure these dimensions empirically. Secondly, it seeks to understand why the design of democratic legislation varies across laws, policy domains, and political systems. Finally, it aims to explain why some laws remain stable over time while others undergo constant adjustment or transformation. By focusing on the dimensions of versatility and precision in legislative texts, this project offers a novel perspective on the substance of legislative output and aims to advance the theoretical understanding of comparative public policy. The innovative methodology employed in this project will pave the way for a computational analysis of legislative content, pushing the boundaries of how we study democratic decision-making processes. This research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the complexities of legislative processes in democracies and contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the creation and survival of democratic legislation."

Given the increasingly hostile political climate around the world, solving this task has never been more difficult and more important than today. Yet, despite the crucial relevance of laws for our daily lives and the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic government, our understanding of how the design, creation and long-term survival of legislation are related is still very limited. The DEMOLAW project analyses legislative texts in three different political systems (US, UK, EU) with cutting-edge computational methods to answer three major research questions: (1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law and how can we exploit textual properties of law texts to measure these dimensions empirically? (2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary across laws, policy domains and political systems? (3) How can we explain why some laws are entirely stable over time, while others are constantly adjusted and sometimes transformed fundamentally? The project makes three major contributions. First, it provides an entirely novel conceptual perspective on the design of democratic laws by focusing on two analytical dimensions that are central to any piece of legislation: versatility and precision. This innovative approach allows us, for the first time, to measure and compare the substance of legislative output across and within policy domains, political systems and over time. Second, the project will develop and test an integrated theoretical framework on both the creation and the survival of democratic legislation and thereby advance the theoretical state-of-the-art in comparative public policy. Finally, the projectâ€™s ground-breaking methodological approach will pave the way for a computational analysis of legislative content and will thereby push the boundaries of how we study democratic decision-mak",
