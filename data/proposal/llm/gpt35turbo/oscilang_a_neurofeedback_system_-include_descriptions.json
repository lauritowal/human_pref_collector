    "descriptions": [
        "The OsciLang grant proposal aims to develop an innovative brain-computer-interface neurofeedback system for diagnosing and treating language disorders such as dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). Building on recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, the proposed system will focus on enhancing brain-speech synchronization through phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech signals. This novel neurofeedback tool will provide real-time feedback to participants, allowing them to shape their neural activity while tracking speech and improving language function. By monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, OsciLang will offer a unique approach that has not been implemented in existing neurofeedback systems. The ultimate goal of OsciLang is to not only improve literacy skills in dyslexic individuals but also to establish a general framework for enhancing language learning abilities for individuals with various language disorders. Through a user-friendly interface and EEG measurements, participants will be able to quantify and control their brain activity in response to speech stimuli. The successful development of OsciLang will have significant implications for the field of neurofeedback and provide a sustainable solution for enhancing language function in individuals with language impairments."

To date there is no established neurofeedback protocols for treating language or reading impairments. In essence, this tool will (a) diagnose/measure and (b) improve/rehabilitate an individual’s ability to synchronize their brain’s activity with changes in a speech signal. This novel type of neurofeedback, based on phase coherence of the neural oscillatory activity with speech, will allow us to detect and enhance language function. It capitalizes on our recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, where we found reduced auditory tracking in delta band in dyslexic readers compared with controls, advocating impaired auditory processing in dyslexia. Thus, our work and related findings suggest that literacy skills in dyslexics will improve by means of neurofeedback training protocols that enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, especially in noisy environments. OsciLang will help to sustainably enhance brain-speech synchronization strength by allowing participants to shape their neural activity while tracking speech. This will be accomplished by presenting participants with a simple and friendly interface that quantifies basic parameters of their brain activity in real time, measured via EEG. This information can then be used by participants to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Based on our prior findings, OsciLang’ algorithms will be monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, an innovative approach that has yet to be implemented in a neurofeedback system. Oscilang will also lay the foundations for extending this novel approach to provide a general framework and technology for enhancing any individual’s ability to learn to read.",
