        "The FLORA project aims to address the pressing need for sustainable and healthy food systems in order to combat hunger, mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, and support human health and well-being. This project will conduct a comprehensive diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, identifying key threats and opportunities through system dynamics and complex network analyses. By targeting tailored solutions using an interdisciplinary modelling framework, the FLORA project will enable the identification of effective strategies that consider trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food system components. Led by a PI with a strong track record in interdisciplinary research on global agri-food systems, this project will take a systemic approach to overcome current barriers and establish a robust framework supported by empirical advancements. The ultimate goal of the FLORA project is to contribute to the transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption towards sustainable and healthy food systems."

Do not include information not available in the description below.

While hunger has receded, food systems are causing increasingly severe damage to our environment and health. The FLORA project will contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption necessary to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems. The project will create essential evidence to identify and implement the shifts in practices and behaviours needed to effectively achieve this transformation, by (1) making a diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, from the production and consumption perspectives, with innovative measures of sustainability, (2) identifying key threats and opportunities with system dynamics and complex network analyses, and (3) targeting and evaluating tailored solutions with an inter-disciplinary modelling framework. The project will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food systems components. Global in scope, it sets the ambitious goal to overcome barriers in current approaches by taking a systemic approach and establishing a robust, interdisciplinary framework supported by empirical advancements to tackle complex food systems challenges. This innovative project builds on the PIâ€™s excellent track record in leading interdisciplinary research focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.",
