        "The POLEMIC project aims to investigate the impact of emotional appeals made by politicians on citizens' political choices. With the rise of highly emotive language used by politicians such as Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, and Marine Le Pen, there is a growing concern about the persuasive power of these appeals. However, existing emotional attachments that citizens have to parties, leaders, or issues may moderate the success of such appeals. By analyzing historical data from speeches dating back to 1945 in nine countries, POLEMIC will examine the prevalence of emotional appeals over time and explore why politicians make them. The project will test three alternative theories to explain this phenomenon: whether it is a strategic decision to maximize votes, a reflection of the personality of the politician, or simply a trend. Using innovative methods such as automated text analysis and physiological measurements, POLEMIC will provide insights into how politicians' emotional appeals are perceived by citizens and how they influence decision-making. By combining a macro-perspective on political speeches with a micro-perspective on emotional responses, the project will shed light on the role of emotion in citizen decision-making and the rationality behind politicians' use of emotional appeals."

Do not include information not available in the description below.

With highly emotive language people like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen are pounding on the portals to power. Do such emotional appeals affect citizens’ political choices? Yes, they can. But, citizens’ existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders or issues moderate the success of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theory and use novel methods to explain when (types of) emotional appeals are persuasive, and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. Do politicians actually make more emotional appeals than in the past? And if so why are they doing it? We lack historical data of emotional appeals so we cannot answer these questions. POLEMIC will provide unique, historical data (1945-now, 9 countries) of emotional appeals by politicians in their speeches. I develop and test 3 alternative theories from different intellectual traditions that explain why politicians make emotional appeals: is it either (1) a vote-maximizing strategy, (2) a product of the personality of a politician or (3) just fashionable? POLEMIC analyses emotional appeals of politicians and the emotional responses of citizens to these appeals. Emotional appeals are texts, and emotions are experiences by the brain. To measure them POLEMIC will use innovative methods in political science: automated text analysis to extract emotion from appeals; physiological measurement to measure emotions. POLEMIC offers a ground-breaking combination of a macro-perspective (what politicians say) and a micro-perspective (how citizens respond) and forms a bridge between party politics and political psychology. The project’s output will indicate the importance of emotion in the decision-making of citizens, and the level of rationality that is behind politicians’ decision to make emotional appeals.",
