    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project focused on the study of early Buddhist Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts from the region of Greater Gandhāra. Through the examination of two recently discovered caches of manuscripts from Afghanistan and Thailand, this project aims to conduct philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research to understand the production, transmission, and relationships of Buddhist manuscript cultures in the first millennium CE. The creation of a digital archive will allow for the development of an akṣara database to identify unique scribal identifiers and individual scribes across manuscripts and scriptorium networks. By digitally preserving the manuscripts, their editions, translations, and studying their textual, paleographical, and codicological features, this project will contribute to the scholarly understanding of the development of Buddhism. The direct comparison of the content of these texts with parallels in multiple languages will provide valuable insights into the evolution of Buddhist literature in Greater Gandhāra and beyond. The results of this research will be made permanently available to the academic community, enriching the field of Buddhist studies and advancing our knowledge of early Buddhist textual transmission."

In the last several years, fantastic manuscript finds have surfaced opening new windows into the scholarly study of the development of Buddhist literature. I am one of the few scholars to have access to such material. This project represents a multifaceted, holistic approach to the study of an important and voluminous genre of manuscript witnesses from an early era of Buddhist textual transmission composed in Sanskrit in the Gilgit/Bamiyan type scripts from the historic region of Greater Gandhāra covering modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Northern India. This project centers the study of two large, recently discovered caches of highly important early Buddhist Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts and their place in the body of works from Greater Gandhāra. The first cache was excavated from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and the second is a collection of newly identified manuscripts held in a private collection in Thailand. The philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research conducted in this project will examine textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks in the Buddhist manuscript cultures of Greater Gandhāra and beyond in the first millennium of the Common Era. These results will be made permanently available through the development of a digital archive allowing for the creation of an akṣara database of individual syllables representing unique scribal identifiers, which will identify individual scribes across manuscripts and scriptorium networks, digital preservation of the manuscripts, their editions and translations, study of their textual, paleographical, and codicological features, and the direct comparison of the content of these texts with parallels in multiple languages.",
