        "The proposed project, titled HOMEOSTASIS, aims to develop a new theoretical model of working memory (WM) that considers the dynamic interaction between internal storage and external sampling of the visual world that is still within view. The current dominant theory of WM does not account for this balance, as it focuses on situations where remembered information is no longer present. By conceptualizing WM as maintaining a perceptual homeostasis through trading costs of internal storage for external sampling, this project seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the brain processes and represents information. \n\nThe research will involve novel experimental paradigms that incorporate the physically present environment, utilizing electroencephalographic decoding techniques to decode the content of WM. Virtual reality technology will be used to study WM in interaction with varying environments, and machine learning techniques will be employed to identify biometric signatures in eye movements of patients with specific deficits in WM components. \n\nThis innovative approach to studying WM has the potential to not only advance our understanding of how the brain functions in interacting with the world, but also to provide insights into diagnosing WM disorders and enhancing our interactions with computer-manipulated virtual environments. By challenging existing theories and exploring new experimental methods, HOMEOSTASIS aims to shed light on the intricate workings of WM and its implications for cognition and behavior in an increasingly digitized society."

WM is therefore generally referred to as a limited-capacity system. This limitation is not a problem in daily life, however, because the external world typically remains available and can be accessed relatively easily. The current dominant theory of WM does not explain how the brain balances between internal storage and external sampling, as this theory exclusively relates to situations in which the remembered information is no longer physically present. The HOMEOSTASIS project is motivated by the idea that WM should be studied in interaction with the world that is still within view. HOMEOSTASIS will develop a new theoretical model of WM based on an internal mental economy: I propose that WM maintains a perceptual homeostasis by dynamically trading the costs of accurate internal storage against external sampling of the external visual world. Whereas current research on WM has a strong focus on its maximum capacity, this capacity may hardly be used as observers prefer to minimize internal storage due to the effortful nature of WM storage. I will rigorously test the modelâ€™s theoretical basis using novel experimental paradigms in which WM is studied in interaction with the physically present environment. To decode the current content of WM, I will adopt state-of-the-art electroencephalographic decoding techniques. To study WM in interaction with worlds of varying reliability and familiarity, I will employ virtual reality technology. Finally, I will investigate patients with restricted deficits to specific components of the model and use machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements. This new model of WM will open a new window to diagnose WM disorders and for understanding how we interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments in an increasingly computer-dominated world.",
