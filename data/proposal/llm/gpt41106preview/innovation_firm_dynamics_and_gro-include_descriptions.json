        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal requests funding for an investigative research project aimed at exploring the intricate dynamics of innovation within the context of economic growth and social mobility. The study is grounded in the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, which posits that innovative entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic expansion. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how innovation is measured, its interaction with global trade, the impact of policy on entrepreneurial activities, and the societal ramifications of creative destruction.\n\nThe research will address four critical questions: First, it will assess the accuracy of total factor productivity (TFP) growth as an indicator of innovation. Second, the project will examine the causal relationships between trade activities—exports and imports—and innovation, identifying the primary channels through which trade influences innovative processes. Third, the inquiry will analyze the effects of recent legislative changes in France on self-employment, considering the differential impacts on various social and regional demographics. Lastly, the study will explore the implications of creative destruction on inequality and wellbeing, particularly how job and firm turnover affect social mobility and health outcomes.\n\nBy leveraging novel extensions of the Schumpeterian growth paradigm and utilizing new datasets at the firm and individual levels, the research has the potential to illuminate critical aspects of the growth process, including challenges such as the middle-income trap and secular stagnation. Furthermore, it will contribute to the discourse on the rise in top income inequality and firm dynamics. The insights gained from this research will not only enrich academic understanding but also inform the formulation and redesign of growth policies, ensuring they are better aligned with the evolving economic landscape."

The underlying framework is the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, where: (i) growth is generated by innovative entrepreneurs; (ii) entrepreneurial investments respond to incentives that are themselves shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations involves creative destruction. This project will explore new extensions of the Schumpeterian growth paradigm together with new firm-level and individual datasets to analyze the following questions : (a) the measurement of productivity growth and the extent to which measured TFP growth factors is correctly accounting for new innovation; (b) the relashionship between innovation and trade and more specifically the causal links from export and import to innovation, and the main channels through wich export and import affect innovation; (c) the effect of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship: in particular, how recent changes in the French legislation on self-employement have affected individual incentives to become self-employed, and differently so for different social or regional groups of individuals; (d) the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing: in particular, how does creative destruction (mesured by job or firm turnover) impact on social mobility (e.g measured by the probability of making it to top income brackets conditional upon a low initial income or a low parental income) and health. This approach can shed new light on important aspects of the growth process such as: the middle income trap, secular stagnation, the recent rise in top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Moreover, the paradigm can be used to think (or rethink) about growth policy design.",
