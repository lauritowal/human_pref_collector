        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the prevailing assumption that user engagement through social computing features, such as calls to action, is beneficial for websites. Despite the widespread integration of these interactive elements, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding their actual impact on both business value and user behavior. The proposed research aims to critically assess the effects of user engagement, particularly that which is elicited by calls to action, from both a business and societal perspective.\n\nUtilizing an empirical methodology that combines lab-based and large-scale field experiments, the study will explore the consequences of user interaction with content on websites. The lab experiments will make use of a custom-designed website to control and measure user behavior in a controlled environment. Additionally, field experiments will be conducted in partnership with various domain-spanning websites, supported by a collaboration with a leading website-development service provider operating on a freemium model. This real-world setting will enable the examination of authentic user interactions.\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that calls to action significantly influence user conversion rates and the disclosure of information. The proposed research intends to expand on these initial insights by thoroughly delineating the nature of such effects across diverse product domains and identifying the psychological and economic mechanisms at play.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are poised to reshape our comprehension of the economic and societal repercussions of the social computing movement, providing crucial insights for website developers, businesses, and policymakers. The results will inform strategies to optimize user engagement in a way that is both profitable for businesses and beneficial for users, ensuring a more sustainable and ethical approach to social computing."

Accordingly, websites in numerous domains invest heavily in ‘social computing’ features that encourage such engagement. In fact, many attempt to elicit engagement proactively, through the use of calls to action—prompts that ask users to carry out participatory actions such as rating or ‘liking’ content. Given the vast popularity of social computing, it is surprising how little we actually know about how user engagement affects websites and their users. From a business perspective, the direct value of user engagement is far from clear. From a societal perspective, it is unclear whether the increasing expectation for users to engage with firms may lead users to behave in ways that do not serve them. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of user engagement, and specifically, engagement elicited by calls to action, from those two perspectives. I will use an empirical approach, relying on innovative lab and large-scale field experiments. The lab experiments leverage a specially-designed website. For the field experiments, we will collaborate with websites spanning several domains; we have already initiated a relationship with a leading website-development service provider that uses a freemium business model, and have been able to observe the actual behavior of its users. Our preliminary results are promising, supporting the idea that calls to action have strong effects on conversion and information revelation. Moving forward, I plan to fully characterize the nature of these effects in multiple product domains, and to isolate their underlying mechanisms. I am confident that this research program will transform our understanding of the economic and broader societal impact of the social computing phenomenon.",
