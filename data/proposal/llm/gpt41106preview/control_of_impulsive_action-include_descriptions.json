        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a research program dedicated to advancing our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms, an area critical to addressing various clinical and behavioural disorders. Traditional approaches have narrowly concentrated on reactive inhibitory control in relation to well-practiced actions, leaving fundamental aspects of impulsive behavior largely unexplored. Our research endeavors to fill these gaps by proposing a comprehensive study that focuses on the multifaceted nature of impulsive actions and executive control.\n\nThe proposed program is structured around five pivotal questions: the possibility of impulsive actions emerging during the task-preparation phase, the influence of negative emotions on the genesis and regulation of impulsivity, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functional and dysfunctional roles of impulsive actions, and the relationship between state impulsivity and trait impulsivity. To address these inquiries, we will employ a combination of innovative behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), physiological assessments including facial electromyography (EMG), and sophisticated mathematical modeling of decision processes.\n\nThe ambition of this research is to revolutionize the field of impulsive action by replacing outdated models with a robust, nuanced framework capable of elucidating the dynamics of impulsivity and its control across various contexts. By achieving this, we aim not only to enhance the theoretical understanding of impulsive behavior but also to provide practical insights that can inform interventions and treatments for impulse-control disorders. The success of this program has the potential to deliver significant benefits for individuals and society, fostering improved mental health and wellbeing through better self-regulation."

Failures to regulate impulsive actions have been associated with a variety of clinical and behavioural disorders. Therefore, establishing a good understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and how to improve them could be hugely beneficial for both individuals and society at large. Yet many fundamental questions remain unanswered. This stems from a narrow focus on reactive inhibitory control and well-practiced actions. To make significant progress, we need to develop new models that integrate different aspects of impulsive action and executive control. The proposed research program aims to answer five fundamental questions. (1) Can novel impulsive actions arise during task-preparation stages?; (2) What is the role of negative emotions in the origin and control of impulsive actions?; (3) How does learning modulate impulsive behaviour?; (4) When are impulsive actions (dys)functional?; and (5) How is variation in state impulsivity associated with trait impulsivity? To answer these questions, we will use carefully designed behavioural paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (e.g. facial EMG), and mathematical modelling of decision-making to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions. Our ultimate goal is to transform the impulsive action field by replacing the currently dominant ‘inhibitory control’ models of impulsive action with detailed multifaceted models that can explain impulsivity and control across time and space. Developing a new behavioural model of impulsive action will also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of individual differences in impulsivity and the many disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.",
