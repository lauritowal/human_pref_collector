        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the integration of linguistic and genetic data to refine the historical classification of species and populations. The project builds upon the hypothesis of a correlation between language families and genetic markers, as suggested by Sokal, Cavalli Sforza, and others, which parallels Darwin's prediction of a congruence between trees of languages and populations. The proposal highlights the limitations of current language classification methodologies, which are either too narrow or probabilistically unreliable for establishing robust long-range taxonomies. To overcome these limitations, we propose the implementation of a novel comparative method, based on grammatical evidence and informed by recent advancements in formal and typological linguistics. This method promises high standards of testability and replicability, and it is capable of measuring linguistic distances among widely separated populations. Collaboratively, linguists and biologists will select populations of joint significance for comprehensive language and gene sampling. Furthermore, the project will leverage cutting-edge genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and the analysis of uniparentally transmitted genetic markers. By integrating modern biostatistical methods, the project aims to elucidate the complex relationships between linguistic and genetic diversity. The synergy of these disciplines is expected to yield significant insights into the co-evolution of human languages and genetic lineages, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of human history."

Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994) advocated a correspondence between some proposed language families and classical genetic markers, i.e. between biological evolution and transmission of cultural traits (languages), in agreement with Darwin’s (1859) prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. Their conclusions were variously criticised, and are especially undermined by the weakness of available language classification methods, mainly based on lexical (in a broad sense) material: these are either too narrow in scope (classical method) or probabilistically unreliable (Greenberg’s mass comparison) to provide solid long-range taxonomies to be matched against those of geneticists. We will address such issues with a radically new comparative method (Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) based entirely on grammatical evidence and on recent theoretical advances in formal and typological linguistics. The method ensures unprecedented standards of testability/replicability and can measure linguistic distances between even remote populations. Linguists and biologists will for the first time jointly select the populations most significant from either perspective for language/gene sampling. We will also adopt the newest powerful genetic tools of the last decade, both in terms of data (genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, including uniparentally transmitted markers of the Y chromosome and of mitochondrial DNA) and of biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.",
