        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project aimed at re-evaluating China's urban governance model against the backdrop of its unprecedented urbanization, which presents unique theoretical and practical challenges. The study adopts a multi-scalar approach, dissecting the complex dynamics at play from micro-level neighborhood interactions to macro-level regional transformations.\n\nAt the neighborhood scale, the project examines the interplay between state apparatus and societal forces within the quotidian urban fabric, focusing on the social agency of migrants and the self-management practices within homeowners' associations amidst housing commodification. At the city level, the research scrutinizes urban development strategies, governance of migrant and ecological urbanism, and the operationalization of projects via financial tools and the land market. Moving to a regional perspective, it explores the intertwined state-market relationships that redistribute populations and economic activities, shaping the city-region construct.\n\nThe empirical research is anchored in six case studies across diverse Chinese locales, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. Employing ethnography, in-depth interviews, and collaboration with local scholars and policymakers, the project ensures a comprehensive understanding of urban governance across different geographies and scales.\n\nThis investigation is of immediate relevance as China embarks on a new urban agenda endorsed by the United Nations and reconsiders its governance models amidst international trade tensions. The project promises to revolutionize our perception of Chinese urban governance, integrating indigenous viewpoints into the analysis of China's urban metamorphosis.\n\nWith a commitment to knowledge dissemination, the research team will conduct six workshops within China and produce a series of publications. This groundbreaking work aims to enrich theories of entrepreneurial urban governance and provide an empirically rich, contextually grounded account of state-driven entrepreneurialism in Chinese cities."

This ground-breaking project will rethink China’s model of urban governance through grounded and multi-scalar investigations ranging from neighbourhoods and cities to regions. For neighbourhoods, it unravels the interface between state and society in everyday living space, migrant social agencies and the self-governance of homeowners’ associations under urbanisation and housing marketization. For cities, it interrogates the development strategies and governance of migrant and ecological urbanism as well as the implementation of projects through financial instruments and the land market. For regions, it uncovers entangled state–market relations which redistribute population and economic activities across cities and produce the city-region. The research will be conducted through six cases: Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, based upon grounded ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews and close engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers across different types of neighbourhoods and cities of varying sizes in coastal, central and western regions, and recent national strategic projects. The project is timely for China to implement a UN-endorsed new urban agenda and rethink its model in the face of trade tensions. It will change how we think of China and its governance and be the first of its kind to explicitly consider indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation. This innovative and contextually sensitive research will contribute to entrepreneurial urban governance theories and will offer a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China, with six workshops organised within China as integral parts of knowledge production as well as a series of publication outputs.",
