        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe nautical chart, a pivotal tool in the epoch of early modern maritime exploration, remains an enigmatic artifact within historical research. Despite the established discipline of the History of Cartography and the years dedicated to the examination of old charts, the comprehensive technical understanding of these charts is nascent. This grant proposal seeks to delve into the mysteries of the pre-Mercator nautical chart, scrutinizing its origins, technical evolution, and practical usage. The proposed research will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, merging traditional historical analysis with cutting-edge methodologies such as analytical cartometry, numerical modelling, and specialized manuscript examination under specialized lighting conditions.\n\nThe principal objectives are to uncover concealed graphic elements intrinsic to the charts' fabrication and application, delineate their geometric properties, correlate these features with concurrent seafaring practices and voyages of discovery, and digitally reconstruct their creation process based on historical texts. The proposed techniques have proven successful in previous investigations, notably resolving the longstanding enigma surrounding the Mercator projection's inception in 1569. The current inquiry expands this methodological framework to a broader corpus of charts from diverse periods and localities to address more profound and complex queries that have long stumped cartography historians.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research are multifold. Not only will it provide a substantive leap in understanding the technical aspects of historical nautical charts, but it will also forge connections across the broader spectrum of intellectual history. The revelation of how these charts were constructed and employed will illuminate the cognitive and methodological underpinnings of maritime navigation that shaped the worldviews of European societies during critical periods of global expansion. The success of this project promises to make a significant and transformative contribution to the history of cartography and beyond."

This fact is very surprising as it was through those charts that the newly discovered world was first shown to the amazed eyes of the European nations. Although the History of Cartography is a well-established academic discipline and old charts have been examined for many years, their detailed technical study is still in its infancy. What is the origin of the pre-Mercator nautical chart, how charts evolved technically over time and how they were used at sea are all critical questions that remain to be answered. I intend to approach these challenges in a truly interdisciplinary way, by using innovative and powerful tools as a complement to the traditional methods of historical research: analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling and the examination of the manuscripts through special lighting. By applying these tools to a large sample of charts of various periods and origins, I aim to unveil hidden graphic content related to their construction and use, to characterize their main geometric features, to establish meaningful connections with contemporary navigational methods and exploration missions, and to numerically simulate their construction by taking into account the explanations given in the textual sources. The effectiveness of those techniques has already been demonstrated in my previous studies, such as in the solution of an historical enigma which had been alive for more than a century: the construction of the Mercator projection, in 1569. Now, I propose to handle a broader and more complex set of questions, which has eluded the historians of cartography for even a longer period. The clarification of these issues will have a ground-breaking impact, not only in the strict field of the History of Cartography, but also in the context of the intellectual history at large.",
