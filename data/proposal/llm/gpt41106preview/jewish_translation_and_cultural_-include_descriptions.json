        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking project titled JEWTACT, aimed at redefining the concept of modernization within Jewish culture. Rejecting the prevalent view of modernity as a disruptive cultural force, this research proposes a novel perspective wherein modernity emerges through a gradual and selective process of adaptation and innovation. Central to this process is the extensive yet underexplored body of early modern Jewish translations of non-Jewish texts, which serves as the focal point of this study.\n\nJEWTACT seeks to conduct the first comprehensive examination of these translations, which were instrumental in shaping Jewish culture from the sixteenth century onward. Contrary to being passive assimilations, these translations represent active engagements by Jewish translators who navigated their cultural landscape with a blend of caution and creativity. These individuals often modified their sources—through intentional mistranslations, additions, omissions—to align with their specific communal needs and objectives. Thus, a new, distinctly Jewish corpus emerged, reflecting a deep correspondence with the dominant majority culture of the time.\n\nBy scrutinizing this corpus, the project endeavors to reveal the myriad of intercultural encounters that took place at the dawn of modernity, bridging gaps between East and West, tradition and innovation, and between Christian and Jewish communities. JEWTACT positions translation as the essential mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transmission during the early modern period in Europe.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is a transformative understanding of the early modern \"Jewish book\" as a product of porous boundaries and collaborative efforts. Ultimately, the project aims to establish a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange, challenging existing narratives and opening fresh avenues for scholarly discourse."

This massive upheaval is said to have shaken the very foundations of every culture it frequented, subsequently eliminating the world which once was, to make way for a new age. This project offers a new understanding of modernization, not as a radical break with tradition, but as the careful importation of new ideas by often timid, almost inadvertent innovators. The project focuses on the rich corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which developed during the early modern period. Largely neglected by modern scholars, these translations played a pivotal role in fashioning Jewish culture from the sixteenth century into modern times. Jewish translators were never merely passive recipients of their non-Jewish sources; they mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, and harnessed their sources to meet their own unique agendas. Throughout the process of translation then, a new corpus was created, one that was distinctly Jewish in character, but closely corresponded with the surrounding majority culture. JEWTACT offers the first comprehensive study of the entire gamut of these early modern Jewish translations, exposing a hitherto unexplored terrain of surprising intercultural encounters which took place upon the advent of modernity—between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. The project posits translation as the primary and most ubiquitous mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer in early modern Europe. In so doing, I wish to revolutionize our understanding of the so-called early modern “Jewish book,” revealing its intensely porous, collaborative and innovative nature, and to offer a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange.",
