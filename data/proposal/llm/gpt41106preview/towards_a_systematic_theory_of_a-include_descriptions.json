        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe STARTDIALOG project aims to revolutionize the understanding and application of Aristotelian diagrams, such as the square of opposition, across various disciplines including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. Recognizing the historical significance yet contemporary underutilization of these diagrams due to existing challenges in their application, our project proposes to create a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams. This theory will be achieved through an innovative approach, involving the development of a systematic typology and a comprehensive database of Aristotelian diagrams. This typology will mirror the transformative role of Mendeleev's periodic table in chemistry by providing an organized framework to consolidate and expand our knowledge on Aristotelian diagrams. Our aim is to clarify prevalent issues and enhance the methodological understanding of these diagrams, leading to significant advancements in their application.\n\nThe STARTDIALOG project's unique contribution lies in its potential to study Aristotelian diagrams beyond their individual use cases, treating them as independent subjects of interest within logical geometry. This shift in perspective promises a major breakthrough in the theoretical investigation of these diagrams. Moreover, the project's interdisciplinary focus guarantees that its findings will have a wide-reaching impact. Not only will it benefit philosophical logicians and philosophers, but it will also extend to all researchers employing Aristotelian diagrams in their study of logical reasoning. Thus, the STARTDIALOG project stands to make a substantial contribution to the field of logical geometry and beyond, fostering a deeper and more accurate application of Aristotelian diagrams in various scientific domains."

Nowadays, they also have several applications in other disciplines that are concerned with logical reasoning, such as psychology, linguistics and computer science. However, many of the applications of Aristotelian diagrams suffer from substantial problems, often due to a lack of understanding of the intricate logical properties of these diagrams. Consequently, the tremendous heuristic potential of Aristotelian diagrams has remained vastly underappreciated thus far. The overarching goal of the STARTDIALOG project is to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams. We will use a radically new research strategy to accomplish this goal, viz. developing a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams in close interplay with a comprehensive diagram database. This empirically informed typology will systematically organize all our (existing and new) knowledge about Aristotelian diagrams, similarly to the role of Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements in chemistry. This will enable us to clarify and solve many of the issues that currently surround the applications of these diagrams, and thereby lead to a more accurate understanding of their methodological importance. This unified theory will allow us to move beyond the specific details of any given application, and to study Aristotelian diagrams as objects of independent interest. This will constitute a major breakthrough in logical geometry, i.e. the theoretical investigation of Aristotelian diagrams. However, because of the widely interdisciplinary use of these diagrams, the scientific impact of the STARTDIALOG project will reach far beyond the boundaries of logical geometry: its results will be relevant for other philosophical logicians as well, for philosophers in general, and ultimately, for all researchers who make use of Aristotelian diagrams in their research on logical reasoning.",
