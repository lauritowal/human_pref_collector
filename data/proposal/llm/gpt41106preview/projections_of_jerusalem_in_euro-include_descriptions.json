        "**Abstract:**\n\nOur proposal aims to embark on a groundbreaking exploration of the numerous, yet uncharted, multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem within Europe. These elaborate monuments serve as three-dimensional representations of the holy places of Jerusalem, meticulously mirroring their spatial and topographical relationships. They blend architecture, sculptural ensembles, painted décor, and accompanying artifacts to offer a holistic re-enactment of the sacred spaces and narratives.\n\nDespite their apparent significance, these monuments have never been subjected to a comprehensive study, with their exact count speculated to be in the hundreds. Our project is poised to pioneer this new field of research, promising significant academic contributions from the outset by collecting fresh data and offering novel interpretations. We intend to conduct an exhaustive documentation and a rigorous comparative study of these sites, utilizing theoretical frameworks such as conceptions of iconography, mapping, networks, interactivity, and the dynamics of space and place.\n\nOur research endeavors to contribute fundamental insights into the discourse concerning the relationship between original and reproduction, narrative and iconography. Moreover, it will augment the understanding of pilgrimage, the creation of sacred spaces, devotional practices, and the intricate processes of memory and mnemonic devices.\n\nThe methodology will include meticulous fieldwork, textual analysis, and the categorization of these monuments into thematic and historical clusters. This will be complemented by an iterative process of synthesis through discussions, working papers, as well as scholarly symposia and conferences to incorporate wider academic engagement.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of our project will be disseminated progressively, ensuring that each phase of the research is shared with the academic community. The culmination of our work will be the publication of a comprehensive book that encapsulates the entirety of our findings, promising to be a seminal reference in the field."

These monuments represent the loca sancta through architectures in spatial and topographical relationships that reproduce the real ones, sculptural groups that re-enact the respective event in a painted décor, with artifacts completing the ambience. The project proposes to document, comprehensively study and conceptualize these sites. Their exact number is not known since a comprehensive study has never yet been attempted, but they can probably be numbered in many hundreds. This project will open up a totally new research area with considerable impact already at the initial documentation and survey stages, by bringing together both fresh data and interpretations. But the project proposes to go beyond and generate many new insights by a comparative study of the sites and a conceptualization of the phenomenon (with the aid of notions such as icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, space and place). The study will lead to the integration of these three-dimensional complexes in the ongoing discourse of image, and to the theoretical discourse pertaining to the relationships between original and copy, narrative and iconic. It will contribute essential new insights to the study of pilgrimage, the definition and process of the formation of sacred spaces, to devotionalism as a special type of piety and to the study of memory and mnemonic practices. Research will include field and textual documentation, cross referencing and grouping of related monuments, leading to crystallization of several clusters of monuments, representative at Pan-European and historical levels. Research will be accompanied by a conclusion-reaching process through discussions in small groups, exchange of working papers, as well as symposia and conferences with external participation. The results will be published throughout the stages of work, as well as in a book at the end of the research period.",
