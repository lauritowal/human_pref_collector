        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project addresses the imperative yet unresolved issue of the evolutionary origins of friendship and its role in human health and societal well-being. Given the alarming health risks associated with social isolation, including a heightened risk of heart disease surpassing that of heavy smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity, understanding the nature and development of friendship is becoming a crucial objective in public health and political spheres. By exploring the manifestation of friendship from its evolutionary roots to modern expression, this research aims to discern the extent to which the characteristics of friendship are unique to humans or shared among primates.\n\nThe proposed research will undertake a comparative analysis of nonhuman primates, focusing on the macaques, a well-documented group-living species. Through this approach, the study aims to uncover the evolutionary forces and cognitive abilities that underlie the formation and maintenance of social bonds. The project is structured around three principal objectives: firstly, to investigate environmental determinants influencing social bond variations across macaque species; secondly, to evaluate if the capacity to recognize friendships among non-kin is a cognitive trait exclusive to humans; and thirdly, to examine the hypothesis that social isolation stems from competitive forces within primate groups.\n\nBy integrating cross-species data collection with novel social experiments on a distinct macaque population, this research promises to deliver unprecedented insights into the evolutionary trajectory of friendship. The anticipated findings will not only illuminate the biological underpinnings of social connections but also provide a foundational understanding of the adaptive significance of friendship, thereby contributing to a broader comprehension of what it means to be human. The successful execution of this project will mark a significant advancement in the field, with implications for shaping future health and social policies aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of social isolation."

People who are socially isolated have a greater risk of heart disease than heavy smokers, drinkers, and the obese, and halting social isolation’s ongoing rise is a growing priority for public health and political policy. But coming to grips with our need for friends and the consequences we face in their absence requires we not only look at how friendship is manifested in contemporary societies but to its origins in our evolutionary past. Yet, the evolutionary origins of friendship and the degree to which friendship’s components reflect human specializations are unclear. Studying nonhuman primates allows us to identify the causes and consequences of friendship in evolutionary time and the extent of its human uniqueness. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly little about the contexts that drove friendly social bonds to emerge, whether friendship-relevant cognitive abilities reflect primate universals, and the reasons why evolution allows social isolation to persist despite being detrimental. In this project, I will conduct a series of landmark studies to reveal critical insights into the evolutionary origins of friendship. I will generate an unparalleled cross-species dataset on the best-known taxa of group-living primates, the macaques, and will perform innovative social experiments on a unique macaque population. I have three key aims: (1) to test the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species; (2) to establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill; and (3) to test whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion. Friendship may be one of the most important strategies humans have for surviving in large groups. Understanding friendship from an evolutionary perspective is therefore a critical component of understanding what it means to be human. The proposed project represents a major step forward in that endeavour.",
