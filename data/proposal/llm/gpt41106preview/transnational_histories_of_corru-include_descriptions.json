        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the TransCorr project, which aims to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of \"corruption\" as it pertains to South-East-Central Europe during the pivotal years of 1750 to 1850. In this period, both local and foreign commentators frequently depicted the region as plagued by corruption, linking it to cultural backwardness and economic malaise. The TransCorr project will examine how the term \"corruption\" evolved alongside the rise of modernity and Western European ideas, and how it was used by regional leaders to reframe traditional practices in a negative light. By investigating the interplay between Great Power politics and local governance, the project seeks to understand how these interactions reinforced new interpretations of \"corruption,\" often associated with the Ottoman Empire's influence.\n\nThe research will delve into the way this narrative influenced the region's historical trajectory and its enduring public perception. The project's innovative approach involves integrating regional history with broader global narratives of modernization and imperialism, challenging existing historiography and contributing to the scientific literature. Additionally, TransCorr will recontextualize current discussions on patronage and graft, while offering new perspectives on the dynamics of center-periphery relations within the region and across Europe. By uncovering this genealogy of ideas and discourses, the project aims to reshape our understanding of a term that continues to shape political and economic debates to this day. This historical insight is crucial not only for academic inquiry but also for policymakers and stakeholders engaged with the region's present and future."

A wide range of foreign observers portrayed graft, nepotism, and bribery as endemic. Indigenous critics echoed many of these assessments. Regional insiders and outsiders alike mobilized commentaries on “corruption” for their own political, professional, and personal ends, claiming they could run more honest and efficient administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations than those in power. These notables linked “corruption” to the region's supposed cultural backwardness and economic under-development. In doing so, public figures naturalized notions of “corruption,” making it appear both widespread and organic in the region—popularizing tropes that have endured right down to the present. Yet, “corruption” is a historically specific concept. TransCorr seeks to construct a history of the idea of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe in conjunction with the rise of modernity. It demonstrates how in the context of new ideas about modernity emanating from West Europe, regional leaders reframed a host of traditional customs and practices as corrupt. It examines how Great Power attempts to transform these borderlands into formal and informal imperial provinces further entrenched novel understandings of “corruption”, often pejoratively associating them with the Ottoman legacy. By tracing out this history, TransCorr reveals a genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes that continue to inform analyses of and discussions within the region today. The project brings the study of this geographic area into greater dialogue with a global story of modernization and aligns the region’s historiography with new innovations in the scientific literature. It also reframes contemporary debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigures broader understandings of center-periphery relations within the region and across the continent.",
