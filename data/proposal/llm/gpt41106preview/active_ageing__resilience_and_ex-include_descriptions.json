        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project aimed at advancing the concept and measurement of active ageing. Recognizing the dynamism inherent in the ageing process, the proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive scale with four dimensions: ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy. These dimensions will encapsulate the multifaceted nature of active ageing, aligning with the World Health Organization's definition that emphasizes optimizing health, participation, and fulfilling the needs, goals, and capacities of older individuals. \n\nThe first objective is to develop an evaluative scale to assess the diversity of active ageing experiences. This will involve cross-sectional data collection from 1,000 participants aged 75, 80, and 85 years, enabling a detailed modeling of the pathway to active ageing using advanced statistical methods. The project intends to generate new insights into the prerequisites for active ageing by integrating health, physical and psychological functioning, social and built environments, resilience, and personal skills into the model.\n\nThe second objective is to design a sustainable, multicomponent intervention that promotes active ageing. The intervention will be delivered through a blend of counseling, information technology, and volunteer support, tailored to enhance the active participation of older adults in society. A randomized controlled trial involving 200 individuals will evaluate the feasibility and impact of this intervention.\n\nFurthermore, the research will investigate cohort effects by comparing newly acquired data with a pre-existing dataset collected 25 years prior, offering a unique perspective on the evolution of older people's functioning over time.\n\nThis project promises to invigorate ageing research by establishing a novel active ageing scale, fostering the development of new concepts and theories, and providing evidence-based strategies for active ageing promotion. Additionally, it will contribute to the training of young scientists in this critical field. The ultimate aim is to measure and, consequently, improve the active ageing process, thereby enhancing the quality of life for older populations."

To develop a scale assessing the diversity of active ageing with four dimensions that are ability (what people can do), activity (what people do do), ambition (what are the valued activities that people want to do), and autonomy (how satisfied people are with the opportunity to do valued activities); 2. To examine health and physical and psychological functioning as the determinants and social and build environment, resilience and personal skills as modifiers of active ageing; 3. To develop a multicomponent sustainable intervention aiming to promote active ageing (methods: counselling, information technology, help from volunteers); 4. To test the feasibility and effectiveness on the intervention; and 5. To study cohort effects on the phenotypes on the pathway to active ageing. “If You Can Measure It, You Can Change It.” Active ageing assessment needs conceptual progress, which I propose to do. A quantifiable scale will be developed that captures the diversity of active ageing stemming from the WHO definition of active ageing as the process of optimizing opportunities for health and participation in the society for all people in line with their needs, goals and capacities as they age. I will collect cross-sectional data (N=1000, ages 75, 80 and 85 years) and model the pathway to active ageing with state-of-the art statistical methods. By doing this I will create novel knowledge on preconditions for active ageing. The collected cohort data will be compared to a pre-existing cohort data that was collected 25 years ago to obtain knowledge about changes over time in functioning of older people. A randomized controlled trial (N=200) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the envisioned intervention promoting active ageing through participation. The project will regenerate ageing research by launching a novel scale, by training young scientists, by creating new concepts and theory development and by producing evidence for active ageing promotion",
