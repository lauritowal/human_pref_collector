        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project, STONECULT, designed to investigate the origins and nature of early human culture. The project seeks to address a pivotal question in the scientific community: when did the cultural adaptations that have enabled humans to thrive across the globe first emerge within our lineage? Current understanding, based on previous studies, suggests that both modern humans and early hominins share similar social learning mechanisms that contributed to their technological advancements. However, the observed periods of stasis in early hominin technology challenge this notion and imply a potential divergence in the mechanisms at play.\n\nDrawing from the concept of latent solutions, as observed in non-human great apes, STONECULT hypothesizes that early hominin stone tools did not result from high-fidelity imitation but from socially mediated individual discoveries that did not accumulate improvements over generations. This proposal aims to experimentally test the validity of the cumulative culture hypothesis—currently the default assumption—against the latent solutions model, thereby determining if early stone tools align more closely with the technologies of modern apes or modern humans.\n\nBy employing a comprehensive approach that includes both top-down and bottom-up experimental methodologies, STONECULT aspires to provide a transformative analysis of early hominin artifacts. The project's findings are anticipated to have far-reaching implications across multiple disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. Should the latent solutions model be validated, it would suggest that the emergence of cumulative culture occurred significantly later in our evolutionary history than presently believed, thereby reshaping our understanding of the development of human culture. STONECULT represents the first concerted effort to empirically test the latent solutions explanation for early stone tool manufacture, positioning it at the forefront of research into the evolution of human culture."

While discovering the roots of human culture has been described as one of the 125 most pressing scientific questions of our time (Science, 2005), it remains unclear when such forms of culture first arose in our lineage. Previous research has argued that similar social learning mechanisms underlie modern human as well as early hominin technology. But the latter shows periods of stasis – suggesting the underlying mechanisms were different. A better model for early hominins might be living non-human great apes. Instead of copying the behaviour from others with high fidelity (as modern humans do), ape approaches seem to be based on socially mediated individual reinventions (latent solutions; Tennie et al. 2009). Unlike high fidelity copying, latent solutions do not lead to 'cumulative cultural change', in which technological changes accrue over generations. Latent solutions are thus a core candidate to account for early hominin stone tools because, among other things, they provide an explanation for their stasis. Using both a top-down and a bottom-up testing approach, STONECULT will experimentally test whether early stone tools are manifestations of cumulative culture – currently the null hypothesis in the field – or whether they are best accounted for with the latent solutions model. That is, STONECULT will evaluate whether early stone tools were more similar to modern ape or modern human technologies. The outcomes and conclusions of STONECULT will therefore inform several fields at once (e.g. anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology and primatology). This proposal is the first to test the new latent solutions account of early stone tools. If its predictions are confirmed, then cumulative culture will have emerged millions of years later in our lineage than is currently assumed. STONECULT will radically transform our understanding of the evolution of human culture.",
