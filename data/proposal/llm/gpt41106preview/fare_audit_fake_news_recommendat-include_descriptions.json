        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proliferation of online disinformation poses a critical threat to the integrity of democratic societies, influencing public opinion and disrupting social cohesion. The role of search engines in filtering and presenting information, potentially amplifying the reach of disinformation, is of particular concern yet remains underexplored. Our proposed project, FARE_AUDIT, aims to address this gap by developing a groundbreaking tool to audit search engine outcomes, enhancing the transparency and accountability of online information dissemination.\n\nFARE_AUDIT seeks to accomplish three primary objectives: firstly, to analyze how individual browsing history affects the exposure to disinformation via search engine results; secondly, to enable institutions and the public to detect emerging disinformation swiftly; and thirdly, to challenge echo chambers by simulating alternative search outcomes reflective of diverse online behaviors. This innovative tool will employ web-crawlers to operate without compromising user privacy, circumventing the need for actual user data.\n\nImportantly, FARE_AUDIT is designed to adapt to the evolving landscape of online tracking, preparing for the transition from cookie-based methods to fingerprinting technologies. By harnessing the brief period during which both tracking mechanisms coexist, the tool will expand its analytical capabilities.\n\nThe expected outcome of FARE_AUDIT is multifaceted: it will not only raise public awareness regarding the influence of search engines on the spread of disinformation but will also provide essential stakeholders with a mechanism to identify, track, and combat disinformation. This tool will be particularly valuable in political contexts, where the accuracy of information is paramount. Ultimately, FARE_AUDIT represents a significant step forward in the fight against disinformation, promising to bolster the resilience of democratic processes against the insidious effects of misleading online content."

Citizens increasingly rely on (dis)information available online, either somewhat passively, through social media feeds, or actively, by using search engines and specific websites. In both scenarios, algorithms filter and select displayed information according to the users’ past preferences. There is a real risk that algorithms might reinforce the user’s beliefs and create (dis)information bubbles, by offering less divergent views, or even directing them to low-credibility content. For these reasons, serious efforts have been made to identify and remove “fake-news” websites and minimize the spread of disinformation on social media, but we have not witnessed equivalent attempts to understand and curtail the role of search engines. FARE_AUDIT addresses this imbalance and offers an innovative tool to audit search engines that can be broadly used. It will help to 1) better understand how browsing history influences search engine results, particularly the likelihood of being directed to disinformation, 2) create a system that democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens can use to identify new disinformation, in near real-time, and 3) breach information bubbles by simulating how search results would be different if users had a different online profile. By relying on web-crawlers, our tool is privacy-protecting and does not require any real user data. Moreover, the proposed system anticipates the announced shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting and takes advantage of the expected small time overlap between both systems to learn from both and broaden its scope. Overall, we expect this novel tool to have a meaningful social impact by increasing public awareness of the role of search engines on disinformation spread, and by equipping organizations with a tool to detect and monitor disinformation, especially in political contexts.",
