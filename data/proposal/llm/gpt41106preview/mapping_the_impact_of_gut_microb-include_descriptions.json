        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the intriguing hypothesis that the gut microbiota, with its vast genetic diversity and capacity to produce neuroactive substances, significantly influences human behavior and brain function. Despite humans sharing over 99% of their genetic makeup, individual variations in behavior and brain function are profound. Interestingly, the gut microbiome presents a largely untapped reservoir of diversity, with 40-90% distinction between individuals, potentially underpinning these variations.\n\nThe proposed research aims to elucidate the relationship between gut bacteria, specifically those capable of producing the neurotransmitter Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA), and their influence on GABA levels within the human brain and consequent behavioral outcomes. The study employs a biochemically informed approach, leveraging Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to directly measure brain GABA levels and assess their correlation with the presence of GABA-producing gut bacteria.\n\nStructured into two work packages, the project initially investigates the natural variance in gut microbiota and its potential modulation of brain GABA and related task performance in human adults. Subsequently, the second package tests the effects of a custom-made probiotic, composed of known GABA-producing bacteria, on these same neural and behavioral measures over a four-week ingestion period.\n\nThe outcomes of this research could provide groundbreaking insights into the gut-brain axis, revealing the extent to which microbiota can shape neurochemical landscapes and behavioral patterns. By integrating methodologies from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, the project positions itself at the forefront of a novel investigative domain, with the potential to redefine our understanding of individual differences in brain function and behavior. The findings may also pave the way for innovative microbiota-based interventions for modulating brain activity and treating related disorders."

It seems striking therefore, that 1% of this genetic difference accounts for the large extent of individual variations seen in human behaviour and brain function. One promising alternative source of individual differences is the resident bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, which is 40-90% distinct between different individuals. Bacteria in the human gut outnumber human cells, and account for nearly 10 times as much DNA as that from human cells. Some gut bacteria have been shown to produce Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT), molecules that function as neurotransmitters in the human brain. However, it is not known whether their production in the gut has any impact on behavioural and brain function. This project takes a biochemically informed approach to address this gap in knowledge through focussing on GABA, whose function as a neurotransmitter is well characterised, and which can be assayed directly or through proxy measures of brain and behaviour. The first work package of this project in human adults will investigate whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA can modulate brain levels of GABA (measured directly using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), as well as performance in tasks that depend on GABA-ergic activity. The second work package will test the impact of ingesting bacteria known to produce GABA (packaged as a custom-made probiotic) over a period of four weeks, on the same brain and behavioural measures. Together, these studies will answer a fundamental question of whether the population of gut bacteria capable of producing GABA, as well as its modulation by probiotics, has any impact on the level GABA in the brain and its function. This interdisciplinary proposal brings together approaches from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to chart a new research frontier in understanding individual differences in human behaviour and brain function.",
