        "Abstract:\n\nThe current climate of political disengagement among European citizens is characterized by declining electoral participation, burgeoning support for anti-establishment parties, and diminishing trust in representative institutions. This alarming trend has prompted a series of institutional reforms, notably the delegation of political decision-making to select groups of citizens and experts, which seems paradoxical to the principles of representative democracy that is built on elected representatives. This grant proposal seeks to investigate the effects of such non-elected politics on the public's support for representative democracy and to determine whether these reforms are remedial or detrimental. \n\nOur central hypothesis posits that the impact of non-elected politics on representative democracy is neither universally beneficial nor universally harmful. To test this hypothesis, the proposed research will embark on a comprehensive study across Europe, focusing on three key areas: the democratic preferences and attitudes of Europeans towards non-elected political reforms, a detailed inventory of instances where citizens and experts have been empowered since the year 2000, and the consequent influence of these non-elected politics on citizens' attitudes towards representative democracy. \n\nThe methodology will be an innovative blend of online survey experiments and panel surveys, designed to provide a nuanced understanding of this complex issue. The expected outcome is a deeper insight into the viability of non-elected politics as a means to reinvigorate democratic engagement and trust in representative institutions. The findings will have significant societal implications, offering guidance for policymakers on the potential of institutional reforms to address the crisis of democracy in Europe."

Electoral turnout reaches historically low levels. Anti-establishment and populist parties are on the rise. Fewer and fewer Europeans trust their representative institutions. In response, we have observed a multiplication of institutional reforms aimed at revitalizing representative democracy. Two in particular stand out: the delegation of some political decision-making powers to (1) selected citizens and to (2) selected experts. But there is a paradox in attempting to cure the crisis of representative democracy by introducing such reforms. In representative democracy, control over political decision-making is vested in elected representatives. Delegating political decision-making to selected experts/citizens is at odds with this definition. It empowers the non-elected. If these reforms show that politics could work without elected officials, could we really expect that citizens’ support for representative democracy would be boosted and that citizens would re-engage with representative politics? In that sense, would it be a cure for the crisis of representative democracy, or rather a curse? Our central hypothesis is that there is no universal and univocal healing (or harming) effect of non-elected politics on support for representative democracy. In order to verify it, I propose to collect data across Europe on three elements: (1) a detailed study of the preferences of Europeans on how democracy should work and on institutional reforms towards non-elected politics, (2) a comprehensive inventory of all actual cases of empowerment of citizens and experts implemented across Europe since 2000, and (3) an analysis of the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on citizens’ attitudes towards representative democracy. An innovative combination of online survey experiments and of panel surveys will be used to answer this topical research question with far-reaching societal implication.",
