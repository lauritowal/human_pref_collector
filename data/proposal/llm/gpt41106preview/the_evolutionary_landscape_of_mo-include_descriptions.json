        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe NGIPALAJEM project aims to unravel the intricate evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, set against a backdrop of significant climatic and ecological shifts in Africa. Recent discoveries have highlighted our African genesis, pointing to a complex series of events dating back to nearly 0.75 million years ago (Ma). This period is marked by the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), characterized by intensified climate variability and an extended arid phase that reshaped the continent's environment and its inhabitants. Coinciding with the end of the EMPT, there was a notable transformation in East Africa's large mammal community, a period which also heralds the appearance of the first modern humans.\n\nNGIPALAJEM proposes a multifaceted research strategy to establish key empirical benchmarks for exploring fundamental questions about our origins. The project will expand on recent hominin finds in the Turkana basin through rigorous fieldwork, aiming to enrich the limited hominin fossil record from this critical epoch. Additionally, it will enhance the large vertebrate fossil record from the same region and employ comparative eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic analyses to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of ancient ecological communities. This includes examining the potential influence of human predation on the formation of modern African faunas.\n\nMoreover, the discovery of new, small Middle Pleistocene hominins in the Turkana basin suggests a previously unrecognized diversity within our lineage. NGIPALAJEM will leverage innovative morphometric and analytical approaches to probe this diversity within the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The anticipated findings from NGIPALAJEM are poised to deliver transformative insights into the broader and more extended African evolutionary narrative, of which the development of Homo sapiens is an integral part."

New fossils, dates and genomic studies have consolidated our African origin. Yet, they also indicate a deeper past, involving multiple events. These events stretch to nearly three quarters of a million years ago (Ma), and take the problem of modern human origins into an entirely different climatic and ecological context. From 1.4 Ma, climate dynamics changed, initiating a 1 million-year period (EMPT) during which, besides greater climatic variability, there is a prolonged arid phase, profoundly affecting African environments. By the end of the EMPT, the structure of the large mammal community in East Africa had changed significantly. The first modern humans are part of this change. The recognition of this older, drier context for the evolution of our species drives NGIPALAJEM. The proposed research aims to establish major empirical benchmarks to answer big questions. First, building on new hominin discoveries in Turkana, NGIPALAJEM will undertake extensive fieldwork to add more specimens to the scarce hominin fossil record of this period. Second, it will increase the large vertebrate fossil record from Turkana, and carry out inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses to throw light on the wider evolutionary dynamics of ecological communities, and investigate the role human predation may have played in shaping modern African faunas. Third, new fossils, such as the new small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins that will be described as part of the project, show that the range of hominin phenotypic diversity in the MP is greater than expected, and so novel morphometric and analytical techniques will be applied to the African hominin fossil record of the last million years. The outcomes of NGIPALAJEM will bring a new understanding of how the evolution of our species is part of a broader and longer African evolutionary landscape.",
