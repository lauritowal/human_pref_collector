        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative historical research project that aims to reshape our understanding of welfare and social care evolution in modern Europe by highlighting the often-overlooked role of local actors. The study will concentrate on three distinct European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. It will chart the contributions of families and associations from the late 19th century through to the 1990s, underscoring the collaborative nature of welfare systems where public and private entities coalesced, particularly in areas of fluctuating state influence. \n\nThe research will delve into the complex interplay of inclusion and exclusion within local welfare structures characterized by diverse forms of identity and solidarity, including occupation and religion. This approach will lay bare the dynamics of competition and cooperation in social provision, especially pertinent in contested borderland spaces. By employing comparative and transnational methodologies, the project will juxtapose the welfare landscapes of north-western, eastern, and south-eastern Europe, tracing the flow of welfare-related ideas, individuals, and practices across these regions.\n\nCentral to this project is the belief that the localized histories of social welfare practices and ideologies bear crucial insights into the broader European welfare narrative. The team's comparative and transnational inquiry into these borderland regions holds the potential to significantly inform current debates on welfare reform, particularly in light of the contentious and sometimes violent disputes over social rights in Europe today. The project's outcomes are anticipated to provide valuable historical context that can aid in addressing contemporary societal challenges related to welfare and social care."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",
