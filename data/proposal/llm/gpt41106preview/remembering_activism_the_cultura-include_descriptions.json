        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents \"ReAct,\" a pioneering research project aimed at investigating the cultural memory of mass demonstrations and social activism in Europe from the late 19th century to the contemporary era. While existing studies on social movements primarily focus on their emergence and decline, ReAct seeks to fill the scholarly gap by systematically examining how activism is remembered after it fades from immediate public attention. The project aims to provide a comprehensive account of the remembering and forgetting of activism through various media regimes and to assess the influence of this memory on subsequent movements both domestically and internationally.\n\nStructured around critical periods of intense activism in European history (1871-1914; 1960-1970; 2011-2012), the project will be conducted through three intersecting lines of inquiry: mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. These will respectively analyze the cultural frames used to transform activism into shareable knowledge, the cultural transmission of movement memories, and how later movements reference their predecessors. A significant methodological innovation of ReAct involves the use of network visualization to track the dissemination of narratives and intertextual references.\n\nReAct aims to revolutionize cultural memory research by introducing analytic tools designed to capture the cultural transmission of hope, providing an optimistic counterpoint to the trauma-based models currently prevalent in the field. Furthermore, the project promises to expand social movement research by uncovering the traditions of civic memory and its cultural production mechanisms.\n\nThe outcomes of ReAct will extend beyond academia, offering critical literacies to reconceptualize collective memory and identity from the perspective of active citizenship rather than solely ethnic-national narratives. Through this research, ReAct will empower a rethinking of how past activism informs present and future civic engagement."

But how are they remembered when they are no longer news? Social movements are usually studied in terms of their emergence and subsidence. Despite recognition that activists are ‘inspired’ by precedents, the afterlife of activism in story and image has never been systematically explored. ReAct contends that knowledge about this cultural memory is needed for a full understanding civil resistance. ReAct will provide the first in-depth account of the remembering and forgetting of activism in Europe since the late 19th century. It will reveal continuities and changes in how protest has been depicted in different media regimes; demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying the memory of protest to later generations; and show how this memory feeds back into later movements at home and abroad. The project is designed around case studies from periods of heightened activism in Europe: 1871-1914; 1960-1970; 2011-2012. Work packages follow 3 intersecting lines of inquiry: mediation (what cultural frames have been used to turn activism into transferable knowledge?); afterlives (how has the memory of particular movements been culturally transmitted?); memoryscapes (how have later movements referenced earlier ones?). A key innovation is network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references to predecessors. ReAct will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research: by developing analytic tools with which to capture the cultural transmission of hope, it provides an alternative to the trauma-based models that currently dominate the field. It will also open up a new area of social movement research by revealing traditions of civic memory and how it is culturally produced. Outside of the academy, ReAct will provide critical literacies with which to rethink collective memory and identity in terms of active citizenship rather than ethnic-national grievances.",
