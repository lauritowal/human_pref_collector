        "Abstract:\n\nThe widespread adoption of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) has transformed the landscape of family-building within advanced societies, leading to the birth of over five million children conceived through such technologies. As the prevalence of MAR continues to climb, the need to comprehensively understand its impacts on the well-being of children, adults, and families has become a critical public health objective. This research proposal aims to bridge the gaps in existing literature by deploying a multifaceted approach that leverages substantial datasets, innovative research designs, and conceptual advancements to scrutinize the effects of MAR.\n\nThis groundbreaking research program distinguishes itself by utilizing extensive, detailed population registers and surveys, thus enabling the analysis of large sample sizes that overcome the limitations of prior studies. It is designed to assess the influence of MAR across various life domains, examining an array of outcomes including physical and mental health, educational attainment, and union stability. This holistic evaluation permits an exploration of potential trade-offs in the impacts of MAR, an area previously unexplored due to methodological constraints.\n\nA novel aspect of the proposed research is the use of sibling comparisons, contrasting MAR-conceived children with their spontaneously conceived siblings, and juxtaposing adults who succeeded in MAR treatments against those who did not. These comparisons are aimed at discerning the causal effects of MAR, setting this study apart from its predecessors.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to generate pioneering insights that will shape the future trajectory of MAR-related studies. The findings are expected to hold considerable policy relevance, offering evidence-based guidance to healthcare professionals, informing public health resource allocation, and aiding policymakers in decisions regarding MAR treatment subsidies. The overarching goal is to ensure informed, equitable, and health-oriented practices surrounding MAR, thereby safeguarding the long-term welfare of families."

In advanced societies, the number of MAR treatments increases every year, and, over the last four decades, more than five million MAR conceived children were born, and many more families received treatment. Given this trend, it is a public health prerogative to find out whether MAR affects the well-being of families. Prior findings are mixed and often hampered by low statistical power or conceptual limitations. I propose a programme of research that goes beyond the state-of-the-art by being the first to analyze comprehensively the effects of MAR on children, adults, and families through a combination of uniquely rich data, previously unused research designs, and conceptual innovations. First, in contrast to past work using small or convenience samples, I use extremely detailed and large datasets from population registers and surveys. Second, I compare the impact of MAR on different domains of life by analysing its effects on a range of adult and child outcomes (e.g., physical/mental health, education, union stability), thereby allowing me to investigate trade-offs that have not been previously tested. Third, I use innovative research designs to test whether the impact of MAR is causal by comparing children conceived through MAR treatments to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and adults who successfully conceive through MAR to those who are unsuccessful. The project has the potential to produce ground-breaking results that will impact future research in this field. Moreover, the project will have important policy implications, as its findings will be immediately relevant to health professionals advising couples seeking MAR treatments, to public health authorities allocating resources to mitigate the potentially negative effects of MAR on health, and to policy-makers considering whether to (further) subsidize MAR treatments.",
