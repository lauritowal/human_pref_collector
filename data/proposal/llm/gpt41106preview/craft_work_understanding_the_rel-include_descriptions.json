        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the CRAFTWORK project, an innovative pan-European study designed to examine the evolving relationship between identity and work within the digital era's 'new forms of work.' The project sets out to delve into the experiences, cultures, and practices of 'neo-craft' workers, a growing segment in various sectors that remains underexplored. Through a multi-methodological approach, CRAFTWORK will capture the subjective journeys and perceptions of these workers regarding their class positions and cultural views on social status.\n\nA key aspect of the project is its exploration of how 'neo-craft' work is dispersed across the urban-rural spectrum and the influence of social media in shaping these dynamics. The central ambition is to forge a novel interpretative framework that accurately reflects the nuances of the 'new forms of work,' thereby enhancing the understanding of the future of work—a pressing societal challenge.\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project stands out for its pioneering nature on three fronts: empirically, it represents the first extensive exploration of 'neo-craft' work within the EU; methodologically, it merges digital and qualitative research techniques in a groundbreaking way to study this emerging field; and theoretically, it seeks to redefine the conceptual tools used to analyze the interplay between identity and work amid this transitional period.\n\nBy successfully securing funding, the CRAFTWORK project promises to offer groundbreaking insights and significantly advance the discourse in various academic disciplines, while also informing policy and societal debates on the transformation of work and its implications for identity in a post-industrial landscape."

To do so, it focuses on the lived experiences, cultures and practices of ‘neo-craft’ work across different sectors and geographical contexts in the EU. The project investigates the subjectivities and pathways to work of ‘neo-craft’ workers, their perception of class location and their cultural conceptions of social status. At the same time, it questions the distribution of ‘neo-craft’ work across the urban-rural divide, and the role of social media in this context. The overarching goal of the CRAFTWORK project is to produce a new interpretative framework to understand the relationship between identity and work, that allows to account for the specificities of the ‘new forms of work’. Conceived as such, the project will significantly innovate and empower the critical study of the ‘new forms of work’ across different disciplines and research areas, and contribute to address the major societal challenge of the ‘future of work’. The project is ground-breaking for three reasons: a) empirically, it is the first comprehensive inquiry on ‘neo-craft’ work, currently hidden in existing data, in the EU area; b) methodologically, it experiments an innovative combination of digital methods and qualitative research for the study of work; c) theoretically, it aspires to provide a rethinking of the interpretative categories for the study of the relationship between identity and work in the context of a society transitioning out of the industrial era and into a fragmented scenario, whereby old and new forms of work coexist.",
