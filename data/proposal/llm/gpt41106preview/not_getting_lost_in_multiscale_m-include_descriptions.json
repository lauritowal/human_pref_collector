        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe advent of interactive multi-scale maps has revolutionized the way we navigate and understand spatial information. However, the transition from static paper maps to dynamic digital ones has rendered traditional cartographic principles less effective, particularly concerning user orientation during zooming interactions. The LostInZoom project aims to address this challenge by developing a new paradigm for multi-scale map design, focused on enhancing user cognition through the utilization of visual landmarks as navigational anchors.\n\nOur research will unfold in three integral phases. The initial phase involves rigorous experimentation to comprehend how users perceive and interpret multi-scale maps, with the goal of identifying key visual anchors that facilitate self-location during zooming. The second phase will focus on the innovation of cartographic generalization techniques. These techniques will be tailored to accentuate identified landmarks, thus creating multi-scale maps that inherently guide users through scale transitions. The final phase will concentrate on the creation of novel zooming interactions that leverage these landmarks, thereby streamlining the exploration process and reducing cognitive disorientation.\n\nBy establishing a framework for intuitive map zooming based on anchor theory, the LostInZoom project aspires to significantly improve the usability of multi-scale maps, particularly in high-stakes contexts such as crisis management. This research not only holds the potential to redefine map interaction design but also to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of spatial navigation in our increasingly digital world."

Past research told us how to design paper topographic maps at a given scale to make them readable and understandable by human users. But these rules/guidelines do not apply anymore, and map designers lack guidelines to make maps that are smooth to explore through scales, and it is common for a multi-scale map user to feel lost for a few seconds after a zooming interaction. The LostInZoom project (Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management) seeks to establish a new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps, based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during the zoom. To achieve this novel zooming paradigm, we need new grounding knowledge on how people perceive and understand interactive multi-scale maps, in order to design maps and interaction that make multi-scale explorations smoother. The LostInZoom project will be based on three main pillars. In the first one, we will explore the cognition of multi-scale interactive maps with an experimentation approach, in order to identify the anchors or landmarks that help a map reader locate himself when zooming. In the second pillar, we will design new cartographic generalisation techniques to derive multi-scale maps that magnify the landmarks that are important for multi-scale exploration. Finally, the third pillar will be dedicated to the design of new zooming interactions that focus on these landmarks to smooth even more the zooming exploration.",
