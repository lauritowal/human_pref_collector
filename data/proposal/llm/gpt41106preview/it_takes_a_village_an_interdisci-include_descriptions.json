        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the innovative research project InterCom, which aims to deepen our understanding of intergenerational communication by investigating how the human brain navigates interactions across different age groups. Despite the prevalence of such interactions in daily life, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms that facilitate or hinder communication between generations. This project seeks to address questions such as the influence of age-related changes in brain rhythms on conversation dynamics, the processing of speech across ages, and the potential neurobehavioral bases for miscommunications among children, adults, and older adults.\n\nInterCom is distinctive in its methodological approach, employing a novel 'community neuroscience' framework that integrates real-world observation with rigorous laboratory experimentation. This bidirectional strategy will involve collecting a rich array of brain, physiological, and linguistic data from diverse participants during storytelling events held in partnership with community organizations. These real-world data will then shape and refine laboratory-based research endeavors, creating a synergistic loop between naturalistic and controlled experimental settings.\n\nThe project's comprehensive design will not only bridge laboratory findings with everyday communicative experiences but will also foster collaborations across scientific and local community sectors. By exploring the under-researched domain of intergenerational brain-to-brain synchrony and communication patterns, InterCom is set to break new ground in the field of neuroscience. The insights gained from this research have the potential to inform strategies that improve understanding and connection across generations, thereby enhancing social cohesion and wellbeing in our diverse societies."

InterCom combines laboratory research with real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal analyses with interpersonal measures (e.g. ‘brain-to-brain synchrony’), to better understand multi-generational communication, both within and beyond family contexts. Do age-related differences in brain rhythms inhibit conversational flow? How do listeners process speech produced by children or older adults? Can intergenerational miscommunications be partly attributed to the fact that children and older adults are less likely to predict what others are about to say? How can we overcome implicit neurobehavioral culprits of misalignment? Curiously, while laboratory studies have shown that there are significant differences in how children, adults, and older adults process (non)verbal information, these and related questions remain largely unanswered. InterCom will test a novel ‘community neuroscience’ approach, one that flows from the real world, to the lab, and back. We will collect brain, body, and language data from socio-culturally diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events that are co-designed with community partners. The data collected during these events will then inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies and vice versa. As such, InterCom leverages the benefits while offsetting the downsides of both naturalistic observations and experimental control, and will innovate on and combine laboratory and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and data analysis in a truly reciprocal manner. Together, InterCom will tread previously uncharted territory in both intergenerational and real-world neuroscience research to generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations.",
