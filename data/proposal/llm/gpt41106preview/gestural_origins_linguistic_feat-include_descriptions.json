        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe evolution of human language is a profound enigma, central to understanding what distinguishes us as a species. This project delves into this mystery by examining the communicative behaviors of our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes, and comparing them to human language features. Building upon groundbreaking findings that great ape gestures carry systematic and meaningful communication akin to human language, this research aims to further explore the complexities of ape communication and its implications for the evolution of human language.\n\nThe grant proposal outlines an ambitious study with three primary objectives, focusing on the cultural variation of ape gestures, the potential syntactic structure within their communication, and the comparison of ape gestures to human language. The research will employ pan-African data collected from 17 ape and 9 human groups to investigate whether apes exhibit cultural differences in their gestural communication, influenced by species type, environment, and social interactions. A novel aspect of this study is scrutinizing whether apes possess the ability to combine signals in meaningful ways that alter the conveyed message, akin to the syntactic structure in human languages. This will involve a detailed analysis of the speed, size, and timing of gestures and their role in constructing meaning.\n\nMoreover, the project seeks to bridge the gap between human and ape communication by examining how both adults and children use and understand gestures, allowing for a direct comparison with apes. Utilizing both innovative and established methodologies, the research promises to expand our understanding across a significantly broader sample than previous studies. Ultimately, the investigation will contribute to the fundamental question of how our unique human faculty of language emerged from our shared evolutionary lineage with the great apes. Through the lens of social learning and syntactic structure, this research has the potential to illuminate the evolutionary steps that led to the rich tapestry of human languages and dialects."

Other species’ communication contains rich information exchange; but humans do more than broadcast information. Language is used to communicate goals to partners, it goes beyond information: it has meaning. Only great ape gestures show similarly systematic meaningful communication; they are essential to understanding how human language evolved. Beyond meaning, two core features of human language are social learning and syntactic structure. These are universals, present across cultures. We all learn words and how to use them from others, leading to languages and dialects. We all use syntax; expressing different meanings by recombining words. In fact, these two features are common in animal communication: sperm whales learn songs from others; finches re-order notes into different songs. But, in a significant evolutionary puzzle, both appear absent in the communication of our closest relatives. The discovery of meanings in ape gesture resulted from studying ape communication under the challenging natural conditions that allow its full expression. A single study of a single group: it was the tip of the iceberg. Employing pan-African data across 17 ape and 9 human groups. I will tackle three major objectives. (1) Is there cultural variation in ape gesture? We will look at how species, physical environment, and social interaction affect how apes acquire and use gestures. (2) When apes combine signals, does it change their meaning? Moving beyond sequential structure we will look at how apes combine signals to construct meaning, and how the speed, size, and timing of gestures impacts meaning. (3) Human-ape gesture. We will investigate adults’ and children’s use and comprehension of gestures to compare them directly to other apes. Using new and established techniques across a dramatically wider sample I will address the fundamental question of how human language evolved.",
