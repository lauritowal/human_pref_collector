        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents an innovative approach designed to revolutionize humanities research on place, space, and geography through the integration of Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS). The principal investigator (PI), leveraging extensive expertise in these fields, aims to pioneer methodologies for the spatial analysis of unstructured textual data within a GIS framework. The project will merge GIS technology with corpus linguistics to analyze diverse texts such as books, newspapers, and official documents, that have traditionally been beyond the reach of spatial analysis.\n\nThe project is structured into four strands, with the initial phase dedicated to the development of these novel methodologies. Concurrently, the first case study will utilize these techniques to investigate the portrayal of the English Lake District across different time periods, focusing specifically on the era of Romanticism. The second case study will expand the scope to examine the relationship between socio-economic shifts, political measures, and trends in mortality rates during the 19th and early 20th centuries in England & Wales. This will involve a comprehensive analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data sources.\n\nTo ensure the broader application of these methods within the humanities, the project includes a capacity-building component. This will consist of short courses, expert meetings, and a culminating conference designed to disseminate knowledge and enhance skills in the field.\n\nThe central research question investigates the potential of GIS to enrich humanities research through the spatial analysis of textual sources. The interdisciplinary approach of this project, blending HGIS, Digital Humanities, and corpus linguistics, promises to transform not only literary studies and historical research but also has the potential for wider applications across ancient to modern corpora. By defining a new frontier in humanities research, this project anticipates making a significant and lasting impact both within the discipline and in other scholarly domains."

Building on the PIâ€™s considerable experience in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), its key aim is to develop and apply methodologies that allow unstructured texts, including books, newspapers and official reports, to be analysed in a GIS environment. The first part of the project will develop these methodologies using technical skills from GIS and corpus linguistics. To truly make a difference to humanities scholarship more broadly, we will apply these techniques to conduct two different but related studies. The first, running in parallel with the methodological development, will analyse qualitative sources to explore writing about the English Lake District before, during and after the Romantic era. The second will broaden the range of sources and the topic by using an extensive range of quantitative and qualitative material to conduct a detailed study of how socio-economic changes and political interventions led to (and sometimes failed to lead to) mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales. A fourth strand of the project will use short courses, expert meetings and a conference to broaden the skills-base in the field. Our themes are diverse however our central research question is clear: how can we exploit textual sources within a GIS to broaden our understanding of the humanities. In answering this we will use a highly inter-disciplinary approach that brings together HGIS, Digital Humanities and corpus linguistics, and applies them to literary studies and history. The techniques developed will be capable of being applied to any corpus from ancient manuscripts to modern newspapers and e-resources. This is thus a field defining project that will make a major impact within the humanities and beyond.",
