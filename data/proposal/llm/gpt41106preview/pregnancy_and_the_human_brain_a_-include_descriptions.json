        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe transformation of the female brain during pregnancy is a profound event, with substantial endocrine shifts facilitating extensive maternal adaptations. While animal studies have hinted at lasting neural and behavioral modifications due to reproduction, the specific impacts on the human brain remain poorly understood. Building upon groundbreaking initial findings demonstrating significant, enduring alterations in human brain structure post-pregnancy, this research project seeks to expand our understanding by systematically charting the evolution of brain anatomy and function throughout pregnancy and into the postpartum phase. This study will also strive to identify the driving forces behind these neuroplastic changes by examining a broad spectrum of hormonal and lifestyle factors, as well as dissecting the neural basis for both potentially advantageous and detrimental cognitive and emotional shifts, with an emphasis on areas of functioning implicated by preliminary evidence. The hypothesis is centered on the notion that pregnancy-induced brain modifications serve dual roles: they contribute to known peripartum challenges, including mental health disorders and cognitive decline, as well as adaptive enhancements in certain cognitive faculties that are essential for, but not limited to, maternal care. Employing a forward-looking prospective cohort design, the study will follow women before conception through to the postpartum period, utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques alongside an array of psychopedagogic and biomedical assessments. The anticipated outcomes of this research are poised to establish a solid groundwork in this nascent area of human neuroscience and offer unprecedented insights into the complex neurobiological transformation accompanying the journey to motherhood."

Animal studies have demonstrated reproduction-related neural and behavioral changes that are evident across the lifespan. However, remarkably little is known on the effects of this monumental transition on the human brain. I have previously shown—for the first time—that pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in human brain structure, revealing the existence of a dramatic pregnancy-related neuroplasticity in humans. Building on these results and new pilot data, I propose a cutting-edge research project that aims to A) comprehensively map the changes manifesting in a woman’s brain by tracking core aspects of brain anatomy and function across pregnancy and the postpartum period, B) pinpoint key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity by means of an extensive profile of endocrine and lifestyle changes, and C) reveal the neural substrates for potential adaptive and maladaptive processes, focusing on specific functional domains highlighted by promising pilot results. I postulate that pregnancy-related changes in a woman’s brain not only underlie well-known adverse peripartum processes such as the development of mental health disorders and memory issues, but also comprise adaptive processes conferring long-lasting changes in specific domains of functioning that play a key role in—but are not restricted to—maternal caregiving. I will investigate this novel topic by means of an innovative prospective cohort study tracking women from before conception across pregnancy and into the postpartum period, which combines cutting-edge neuroimaging approaches with various psychopedagogic and biomedical measures. The proposed project has the potential to lay a firm foundation for this emerging field of human neuroscience and generate groundbreaking insights into a woman’s remarkable neurobiological journey to motherhood.",
