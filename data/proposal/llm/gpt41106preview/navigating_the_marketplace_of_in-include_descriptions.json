        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proliferation of country performance indicators (CPIs) in global governance has ostensibly ushered in a data-driven revolution, where policymakers are equipped with metrics to judiciously deploy resources towards global challenges. However, this profusion has precipitated a conundrum: instead of streamlining decision-making, the multitude of overlapping CPIs has amplified complexity and uncertainty. Compounding this issue is the persistence of flawed but prominent CPIs within the policy arena. This burgeoning complexity raises the critical question: How do stakeholders navigate an environment saturated with competing CPIs purporting to measure identical phenomena? \n\nAddressing this gap, the proposed Navigator project seeks to unravel the dynamics of the \"marketplace of indicators\" across four pivotal policy domains: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Drawing on the liberal marketplace of ideas theory, Navigator will implement a pioneering, systematic approach to scrutinize the longitudinal evolution of CPI usage and production. The study aims to assess: whether and how users incorporate critiques of favored CPIs into their decision-making processes; the strategies employed to select among a plethora of competing indicators; and the nature of competition among CPI producers vying for influence.\n\nThrough this investigation, Navigator endeavors to advance the frontiers of CPI research by shifting the analytical focus from the impact of individual CPIs to the broader dynamics of user and producer adaptation amidst a crowded and critically contested indicator landscape. The insights garnered from this research promise to inform the design of more effective and nuanced indicators, enhance the understanding of CPIs' roles in policy-making, and ultimately contribute to more transparent and accountable governance practices."

States are now measured and ranked on a dizzying array of cross-cutting metrics. Prima facie, the era of indicators promises a revolution: armed with ever improving data, policymakers can better allocate scarce resources to address global challenges. Yet, the era of indicators generates a problem and a paradox: while each individual CPI strives to simplify complexity, an abundance of CPIs on the same issue multiplies complexity and thus generates ambiguity. Moreover, while it would be reassuring if we could assume only the soundest CPIs would thrive, many high-profile CPIs remain in widespread use despite well-known shortcomings.Crucially, the paradox begets a major puzzle that prior research has yet to consider: How do private and public bodies navigate policy fields populated with multiple indicators, each portending to measure the same phenomenon? Although prior research provides firm grounds to hope that CPI users and producers improve their practices over time, no studies have investigated whether they do. Rendering this gap tractable, Navigator investigates the “marketplace of indicators” in four major policy fields: education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Navigator’s novel framework—inspired by the classic liberal theory of the marketplace of ideas—enables the systemic, longitudinal analysis of how users’ and producers adapt their practices over time: Whether users learn in light of criticism of their favoured CPIs, how they discern when faced with a diversity of CPIs; and how producers compete for users within crowded policy fields. In this way, Navigator would push the frontier of CPI research by conducting a systematic problem shift: from investigating a single CPI’s influence or limitations, to examining how users and producers adapt in the face of growing CPI competition and CPI critique.",
