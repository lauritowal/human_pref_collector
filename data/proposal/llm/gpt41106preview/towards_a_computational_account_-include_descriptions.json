        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of how humans navigate the complexities of everyday tasks through an integrated approach combining behavioral experiments and computational modeling. Despite extensive research into individual cognitive faculties, the holistic orchestration of perception, attention, cognition, planning, and action in routine activities remains unclear. We posit that the sequence of behaviors in daily tasks, replete with perceptual ambiguities and action variabilities, can be encapsulated within a framework of optimal sequential decision-making under uncertainty. \n\nOur multidisciplinary strategy harnesses expertise from diverse fields, including psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. The project is designed to progressively tackle tasks of escalating complexity, from simple psychophysical tasks to real-world activities like sandwich making. Our aim is to develop innovative methods to deduce individuals' perceptual uncertainties, task-related beliefs, and the subjective costs and benefits that influence their actions.\n\nBuilding on our prior successes in experimental visuomotor behavior and theoretical modeling, this project intends to deconstruct these complex cognitive processes. By examining behavior on an individual level and a trial-by-trial basis, we will uncover the intricate links between perception, cognition, and action in the flow of day-to-day behaviors. The insights gained from this research may not only deepen our scientific understanding of human behavior but also have practical implications for improving human-machine interfaces, assistive technologies, and artificial intelligence systems that interact with humans in dynamic environments."

Such an every-day situation requires a sequence of behaviors involving the sophisticated interplay of perception, attention, cognition, planning, and action, all unfolding in an ambiguous and uncertain world. Yet, although past research in the behavioral sciences has revealed many properties of these constituent faculties, the understanding of how humans coordinate these cognitive abilities when carrying out every-day tasks is still rudimentary. The goal of this project is to carry out behavioral experiments and develop computational models to identify and characterize perception, cognition, and action in the wild. Our hypothesis is, that sequential actions involving perceptual uncertainty, action variability, internal and external costs and benefits can be understood and modeled in the unified framework of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty. To achieve this goal, we integrate ideas and methods from psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. The proposal is structured in such a way that subsequent work packages consider tasks with increasing naturalness, from classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomtor control, to navigation and sandwich making. We will develop methods that allow recovering subjectsâ€™ perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, their subjective costs and benefits including effort, and action variability. Based on our previous experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical work in modeling such behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis, we seek to elucidate, how perception, cognition, and action are inseparably intertwined in extended, sequential behavior.",
