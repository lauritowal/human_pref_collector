        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes an innovative multi-sited ethnographic study to examine the interplay between human agents and big data/AI systems within the evolving landscape of global health governance. As nations increasingly regard health data as a critical asset, akin to 'future oil', concerns about 'algorithmic ethics' and the implications of AI on social biases, discrimination, and personal autonomy have surged. Past research has primarily scrutinized AI through legal, technocratic, and philosophical lenses, neglecting the socio-cultural dimensions and organizational contexts that shape AI-human interactions. This oversight is critical given the dependence on human oversight in ethical AI frameworks, despite scant empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of human intervention or resistance to AI decision-making.\n\nOur research aims to address this gap by: 1) Empirically investigating the crucial junctures where data analysts either align with or deviate from AI recommendations, which have profound consequences for national health policies and individual lives. 2) Conducting comparative studies across six diverse national settings, each with its own governmental and organizational structures, to facilitate the development of a contextual theory on factors influencing ethical AI practices. 3) Employing pioneering anthropological methods of future-scenarioing to enhance the discipline's ability to conduct forward-looking research. 4) Collaborating with AI developers and health policymakers to not only study but also actively contribute to the development of equitable AI systems.\n\nOverall, this research seeks to illuminate the underexplored human element in AI interactions and its critical role in shaping ethical AI governance, thereby informing both anthropological discourse and practical frameworks for national health systems worldwide."

With health data being considered countries’ ‘future oil’, public and scholarly concerns about ‘algorithmic ethics’ rise. Research has long shown that datasets in AI (re)produce social biases, discriminate and limit personal autonomy. This literature, however, has merely focused on AI design and institutional frameworks, examining the subject through legal, technocratic and philosophical perspectives, whilst overlooking the socio-cultural context in which big data and AI systems are embedded, most particularly organizations in which human agents collaborate with AI. This is problematic, as frameworks for ‘ethical AI’ currently consider human oversight crucial, assuming that humans will correct or resist AI when needed; while empirical evidence for this assumption is extremely thin. Very little is known about when and why people intervene or resist AI. Research done consists of single, mostly Western studies, making it impossible to generalize findings. The innovative force of our research is fourfold: 1) To empirically analyze decisive moments in which data-analysts follow or deviate AI: moments deeply impacting national health policies and individual human lives. 2) To do research in six national settings with various governmental frameworks and in different organizational contexts, enabling us to contrast findings, eventually leading to a theory on the contextual, organizational factors underlying ethical AI. 3) To use innovative anthropological methods of future-scenarioing, which will enrich the anthropological discipline by developing and finetuning future-focused research. 4) The research connects anthropological insights with the expertise of AI-developers, and partners with relevant health decisionmakers and policy-institutions, allowing to both analyze and contribute to fair AI.",
