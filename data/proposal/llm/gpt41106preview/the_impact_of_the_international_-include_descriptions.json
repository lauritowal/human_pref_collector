        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the pressing issue of eviction, a crisis that profoundly affects individual welfare and poses significant societal challenges. The aftermath of the 2007-2011 financial crisis starkly highlighted this issue, with over 700,000 Europeans facing the loss of their homes. At the crux of eviction cases lies the tension between national and international law, particularly when national courts adjudicate cases based on domestic legislation which may not fully align with the broader protections envisioned by international and European human rights law, such as the right to housing.\n\nThe proposed research seeks to illuminate the extent to which international housing rights influence national legal frameworks and judicial decisions. Given the vast quantity of case law generated in the wake of the financial crisis, traditional manual analysis is not feasible. Thus, the researcher will employ an innovative data-driven method, unprecedented in legal studies, to dissect this intersection of laws. By constructing a citation network analysis, the project will treat the right to housing as an interconnected web of international rights and perform an empirical examination of its impact on national court judgments.\n\nMachine learning techniques will be utilized to discern patterns and predictors in court rulings, offering insights into how these may reflect the principles of the right to housing. This methodology is not only novel but also responds to a longstanding call for empirical legal research that harnesses the power of big data analytics.\n\nThe outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the interplay between different levels of legal systems and to provide a blueprint for future legal studies in various domains. The findings could also inform policymakers and legal practitioners, contributing to more robust protections against unjust evictions and the advancement of housing rights on both national and international platforms."

During and after the financial crisis of 2007-2011, over 700,000 people in Europe either lost their homes or were at risk of losing them. National courts use national laws to rule on whether an eviction is just. However, the right to housing, as laid down in international and European law, often demands more protection of the power- and propertyless than national laws prescribe. As a result, national courts are at the centre of the complex interaction between national and international law. In times of growing national resistance towards international law, the questions whether, how, and why international law impacts on national law are among the most topical that legal scholars face. Evictions provide a timely opportunity to determine why international rights, such as the right to housing, may or may not have an impact on national law. The financial crisis has led to an enormous amount of case law (legal big data). The combination of the developed, but understudied, international right to housing and these vast amounts of national data offers a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between international law and national law. It is impossible to analyse all judgments manually. Therefore, I will use a data-driven approach that is unique in the legal discipline. Using citation network analysis, I conceptualise the right to housing as a network of international rights and conduct the first empirical analysis of the impact of this right in case law from national supreme courts and lower level courts. With the use of machine learning, I will identify predictors for courts’ decisions, and explain how these predictors may mirror the right to housing. This approach has long been called for but, so far, rarely been executed. If successful, it could be used in future research projects in other areas of the law.",
