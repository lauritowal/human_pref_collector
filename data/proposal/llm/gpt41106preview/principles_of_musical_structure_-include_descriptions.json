        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research program aimed at deepening our understanding of human cognitive abilities, focusing on how we represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures through the lens of music perception. The project builds upon the Principal Investigator’s (PI) prior work and integrates three interrelated strands of inquiry.\n\nStrand A, the theoretical component, aims to explore and articulate the formal principles that underpin musical syntax and structure in both Western and non-Western traditions. Recognizing the limitations of existing context-free grammar-based models that are largely restricted to harmonic syntax, this strand will develop a more comprehensive theory of musical syntax that incorporates voice-leading and surpasses the expressive capabilities of current approaches.\n\nStrand B, the computational aspect, will address the scarcity of machine-readable music corpora by compiling a substantial digital collection of syntactic analyses. Additionally, the unified theory of syntax proposed in Strand A will be operationalized through the use of generalized parsing techniques and graph grammars. This computational model will be rigorously trained and tested using the newly assembled analytical corpus.\n\nStrand C, the experimental segment, will empirically validate the theoretical framework put forth in Strand A. The research will particularly investigate the mental representation of musical structures, focusing on the cognitive processes involved in understanding nonlocal dependencies, as well as issues related to learnability, revision, and tension within music perception.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this multidisciplinary project promise to make a substantial contribution to our knowledge of music cognition. Moreover, the findings will have broader implications for the cognitive sciences, offering new insights into complex auditory processing and abstract structural understanding in the human brain."

The proposed project aims at advancing the understanding of human cognition and, specifically, the capacity to represent and process complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures by exploring the rich potential of music perception. Building on the PI’s previous work, this interdisciplinary research programme will be divided into three core strands: (A) The theoretical strand will be devoted to the investigation of formal principles that govern musical syntax and structure building in Western and non-Western music. Many current approaches share the expressive power of (tree-based) context-free grammars and are mostly confined to harmonic syntax only. Therefore, they face difficulty in expressing certain crucial syntactic phenomena in music. To address this lacuna, the theoretical strand will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity and reconciles harmonic structure with the constraints of voice leading within a single coherent framework. (B) Addressing the lack of machine-readable corpora in music research, a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses will be compiled and published in the context of the project’s computational strand. Further, the unified syntax theory will be implemented based on a generalized parsing approach and graph grammars, and trained and evaluated using the analytical corpus. (C) The formal framework developed in (A) entails specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure that will be empirically tested in the experimental strand of the project. Particular focus will be on aspects of nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. The outcomes of the project will make a significant contribution to both the field of music cognition and to the cognitive sciences in general.",
