        "Abstract:\n\nThe BECACO project represents an innovative approach to provenance research, challenging traditional methodologies by adopting a broad, multidisciplinary framework. This research initiative seeks to transcend the conventional focus on individual objects, collectors, or institutions, proposing instead to investigate the large-scale movements and socio-political contexts that have influenced the translocation of cultural materials. By introducing the concept of Art World Patterns, the project expands upon Becker's notion of Art Worlds to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play in the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections.\n\nEmploying a diverse array of data-driven methodologies, including quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining, the BECACO project will analyze an extensive body of provenance data. The goal is to assess the potential and constraints of these methods within the scope of large-scale provenance studies, particularly in the field of ethnographic and archaeological materials. The outcomes of this research are expected to yield innovative models for provenance research that can be implemented in ethnographic and archaeological museums worldwide.\n\nCentral to the project is a case study focusing on Indigenous Latin American artifacts housed in 12 museums across 9 countries. This cross-institutional and international examination aims to establish a comprehensive, diachronic understanding of European collection practices regarding Indigenous Latin American items from 1850 to 2000. Through the project's findings, the BECACO team intends to reveal the constructed narratives and academic discourses that have historically shaped Europe's perception and representation of Indigenous Latin American art, aesthetics, and scholarly inquiry. The project's groundbreaking methodology and its implications for the study of provenance will undoubtedly contribute to a redefined appreciation of cultural heritage in museum contexts."

Moving away from the current focus in provenance research on single objects, collectors, or institutions, the aim of the project is to reconceptualize provenance as the large-scale study of the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material. To do so, it introduces the concept of Art World Patterns, an expansion and reframing of the idea of Art Worlds (Becker 2008[1982]). These patterns will be identified through an innovative combination of various data-driven methodologies. By applying quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data, the project will explore the promises and limitations of different data-driven approaches in the context of large-scale ethnographic/archaeological provenance research. Through this process, the project will devise new models for provenance research in ethnographic and archaeological museums. These conceptual and methodological advances will be mobilized through the study of Indigenous Latin American material from 12 museums in 9 countries. The project will create a ground-breaking diachronic, international, and cross-institutional understanding of the collecting of Indigenous Latin American material in Europe. In doing so, the BECACO team will reconstruct how – through the formation of collections – the Indigenous Latin American Art World as it existed in Europe between 1850-2000 constructed a discourse of art, aesthetics, and academic research that shaped how Indigenous Latin America is represented and understood in Europe until today.",
