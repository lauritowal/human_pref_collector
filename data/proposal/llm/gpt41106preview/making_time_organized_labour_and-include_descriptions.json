        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to delve into the significant role of trade unions in shaping national leave policies that facilitate work-life balance, an area of growing importance as recognized by the European Commission. The project is anchored in the recognition that while care-related leave rights are crucial for sustainable employment, there exists a substantial variation among countries in implementing these social policies. Given that women, who predominantly shoulder caregiving responsibilities, now form a substantial portion of union membership, this research aims to explore how organized labour influences the development of statutory leave provisions.\n\nEmploying an innovative mixed-method approach, the study will conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative component will review the interplay between unions and leave policies in affluent democracies from 1965 onwards. In contrast, the qualitative aspect focuses on the policy advocacy efforts of organized labour within three countries: Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. This investigation will differentiate between various social provisions, account for the diversity within trade unions and the workforce they represent, unravel potential mechanisms of union influence, and contrast these dynamics across different institutional settings.\n\nA major goal of this interdisciplinary project is to bridge the gap between comparative policy analysis and social movement research, thereby enriching comparative labour studies and fostering new theoretical frameworks regarding union-policy relationships. Moreover, the project promises to construct valuable data infrastructures, providing longitudinal and comparative data on care leave policies, which is currently lacking.\n\nUltimately, the research aims to evaluate the potential of organized labour as a strategic partner in the development of social policies that underpin sustainable work practices, thus contributing to a more equitable future work environment."

Social policies that make time for family and self-care are important tools for building sustainable work, but countries vary considerably in the extent to which such tools are available. Trade union organizations may play an important role for developing statutory care-related leave rights and protections, particularly as women still provide a bulk of family caregiving and now constitute a majority or near-majority of union members in many countries. This project will use a novel mixed-method design to investigate organized labour’s relationships to national leave policies that grant time-off from work to address care needs, including leave to care for a child, aging parent, or ill spouse or to address self-care needs through sick leave or disability benefits. Quantitative analyses will examine union-policy relationships across rich democracies starting in 1965, and qualitative analyses will examine organized labour’s policy advocacy in Ireland, France and the Netherlands. Analyses of predictors will distinguish between different types of social provisions, consider differences in trade unions and the types of workers they represent, investigate the mechanisms of potential union influence over policy, and compare union-policy relationships across different institutional contexts. A central ambition is to integrate the interdisciplinary fields of comparative policy analysis and social movement research to advance comparative labour studies and develop new theories of union-policy relationships. The project will additionally develop data infrastructures, offering much-needed longitudinal, comparative data on different types of care leave provisions. Overall, the project will assess the extent to which organized labour can be a partner for developing social policies that promote sustainable work for the future.",
