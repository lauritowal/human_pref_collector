        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to address the challenges and expand the understanding of big data policing, a cutting-edge approach to crime prevention. Big data policing leverages extensive historical datasets to anticipate potential crime hotspots, thereby optimizing police resource allocation and aiming to reduce crime incidence. This strategy integrates diverse variables from police records, socio-economic indicators, environmental factors, technological inputs, and other crime predictors into predictive models. Despite its potential, big data policing in Europe is characterized by fragmented knowledge, insufficient interdisciplinary collaboration, and a dearth of rigorous scientific evaluations.\n\nOur project's central goal is to synthesize the statistical, criminological, legal, and ethical facets of big data policing into a cohesive, evidence-based framework. By conducting a series of randomized controlled trials, we will test the efficacy of our integrated model. To ensure a comprehensive and multifaceted approach, the project will facilitate several PhD research tracks, each dedicated to examining a distinct aspect of big data policing. This initiative will foster a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the field.\n\nOur approach diverges from existing commercial practices by prioritizing academic rigor, transparency, and adherence to legal and ethical standards. Through this project, we aim to develop a transparent and validated model that not only enhances predictive accuracy but also respects the legal frameworks and ethical considerations inherent to the application of big data in law enforcement. The outcomes of this research will have significant implications for the future of policing strategies in Europe and potentially worldwide, setting a new standard for the responsible use of big data in public safety operations."

Big data policing models can consist of variables based on crime data available in police databases (e.g. previous crime events), socio-economic data (e.g. poverty index, residential mobility), opportunity characteristics (e.g. the presence of shops, distance to nearest highway), data from new technologies (e.g. intelligent cameras) and other known predictors of crime (e.g. police patrol intensity). However, there are several research gaps that need to be addressed. First, knowledge about and expertise in big data policing in Europe is currently fragmented. Second, there is a lack of interdisciplinarity with regard to big data policing studies, and yet the involvement of several disciplines is required when studying the issue. Third, there is a lack of scientific evaluations of big data policing models. The overarching objective of this ERC project is to unite and integrate the statistical-methodological, criminological, legal and ethical dimensions of big data policing in an evidence-based model that will be tested by different randomized controlled trials and built on the principles of an international (i.e. European) and interdisciplinary approach. The latter aim should be enabled by incorporating and conducting different PhD tracks focusing on these specific dimensions, which should allow better knowledge, insights and understanding of big data policing to be developed. This approach is innovative and radically different from the existing commercial and economic initiatives, which lack transparency on their predictive reliability and validity, effectiveness and legal and ethical safeguards.",
