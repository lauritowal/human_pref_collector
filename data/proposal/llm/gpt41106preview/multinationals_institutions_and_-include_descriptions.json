        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to fund a comprehensive research project aimed at investigating the intricate dynamics governing the location strategies of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and their consequential territorial impacts. Despite MNEs' significant contribution to global GDP, with a combined value added of US$16 trillion in 2010, academic consensus on the long-term determinants of MNE location decisions and their effects on host economies remains elusive. This gap in understanding is primarily due to three identified deficiencies in existing research: the neglect of critical spatial and institutional factors influencing MNE investment choices; the cursory examination of MNEs' broader economic impacts; and the failure to link location motives with subsequent effects.\n\nOur research will address these shortcomings by incorporating a nuanced analysis of territorial elements, MNE heterogeneity, and the role of local institutional conditions in shaping investment decisions. Additionally, we will delve into the varied and complex effects of MNE operations on host economies, considering how institutional frameworks act as filters for these outcomes. Furthermore, we will explore the interconnectedness of MNEs' location rationales and their impacts, thereby bridging currently siloed research streams.\n\nThe outcomes of this study promise to illuminate the factors sculpting the economic geography of MNEs and the implications thereof, offering valuable insights for policymakers seeking to foster innovation, job creation, and economic recovery in the post-crisis era. The proposed research is poised to advance academic discourse while providing practical frameworks for enhancing the positive effects of MNEs within diverse economic landscapes."

In 2010, MNEs generated value added for approximately US$16 trillion accounting for more than a quarter of world GDP (UNCTAD, 2012). The progessive expansion of firms from emerging economies into multinational enterprises is unprecedented. Outflows of FDIs from developing economies reached the record level of $426 billion in 2012, corresponding to 31% of global outflows, up from 16% in 2007 (UNCTAD, 2013). However, there is no consensus in the academic literature on both the factors able to shape the long-term location decisions of MNEs and, more generally, on the ultimate impact of MNEs on their host economies. This lack of consensus reflects three fundamental gaps in the existing literature. First the omission of some fundamental determinants of MNEs investment decisions in ‘traditional’ national-level analyses. Territorial/spatial factors, MNEs heterogeneity and local institutional conditions have been often overlooked in MNEs location analyses. Second the limited attention to the broader set of impacts of MNEs in their host economies and the role of institutional factors as selective ‘filters’ for these impacts. Third the intimate inter-connection between location motives and impacts has remained unexplored in the grey areas between separate streams of literature. This research project will investigate the location strategies of MNEs and their territorial impacts addressing these three fundamental gaps in the existing literature, shedding new light on the factors shaping the economic geography of MNEs and their impacts and providing policy-makers at all levels with new tools to promote innovation, employment and economic recovery after the current economic crisis.",
