        "**Abstract:**\n\nNUCLEARWATERS is an innovative research initiative aimed at re-conceptualizing the history of nuclear energy through the lens of water, proposing that nuclear technology is fundamentally a form of hydraulic engineering. This project transcends traditional interpretations focused on nuclear physics and radiochemistry, presenting a novel perspective that aligns nuclear advancements with historical hydraulic civilizations, from ancient times to contemporary societies. The research investigates the influence of historic water manipulation technologies and associated risk perceptions, and how these have been integrated into the nuclear era, sometimes setting the stage for catastrophic outcomes.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that a water-centric view of nuclear history can illuminate underlying patterns and causes behind numerous nuclear incidents and accidents globally. NUCLEARWATERS is organized into six work packages, each scrutinizing the pivotal role—and inherent conflicts—of water within the nuclear narrative from various thematic and geographic vantage points. These comprehensive studies will offer insight into the international community of nuclear-hydraulic engineers, explore the nuclear-infused waters of the Soviet Union, delve into the nuclearized Rhine Valley, examine Japan's atomic coastal regions, and assess the ecologically sensitive and politically charged Baltic Sea area.\n\nThe overarching goal of NUCLEARWATERS is to profoundly reshape our understanding of nuclear energy history. The expected outcomes promise to advance the field of the history of technology, fostering a deeper integration with environmental history, and to stimulate informed public discourse on nuclear energy's role in Europe and the world. This project not only rewrites history but also contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of nuclear energy's past and its trajectory into the future."

Rather than interpreting nuclear energy history as a history of nuclear physics and radiochemistry, it analyses it as a history of water. The project develops the argument that nuclear energy is in essence a hydraulic form of technology, and that it as such builds on centuries and even millennia of earlier hydraulic engineering efforts worldwide – and, culturally speaking, on earlier “hydraulic civilizations”, from ancient Egypt to the modern Netherlands. I investigate how historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions from a deeper past were carried on into the nuclear age. These risk conceptions brought with them a complex set of social and professional practices that displayed considerable inertia and were difficult to change – sometimes paving the way for disaster. Against this background I hypothesize that a water-centred nuclear energy history enables us to resolve a number of the key riddles in nuclear energy history and to grasp the deeper historical logic behind various nuclear disasters and accidents worldwide. The project is structured along six work packages that problematize the centrality – and dilemma – of water in nuclear energy history from different thematic and geographical angles. These include in-depth studies of the transnational nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, of the Soviet Union’s nuclear waters, of the Rhine Valley as a transnational and heavily nuclearized river basin, of Japan’s atomic coastscapes and of the ecologically and politically fragile Baltic Sea region. The ultimate ambition is to significantly revise nuclear energy history as we know it – with implications not only for the history of technology as an academic field (and its relationship with environmental history), but also for the public debate about nuclear energy’s future in Europe and beyond.",
