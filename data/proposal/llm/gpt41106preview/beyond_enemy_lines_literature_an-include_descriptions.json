        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a pioneering multidisciplinary study exploring the cultural interplay between Anglo/American and German literature and film during the Allied Occupation of Germany. The research aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany, unveiling a new interpretative framework for understanding postwar culture. It will delve into the intertwined histories of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature, which have been traditionally viewed as distinct, and the transformation of these relations during the transition into the Cold War era. Through a combination of literary and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing, the project aspires to inaugurate a significant new field of scholarly inquiry, shedding light on the complex cultural exchange and its enduring impacts on transatlantic relations."

It will be the first study to survey the cultural landscape of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany in any detail. By doing so it will offer a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, in particular in three areas: the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany; the history of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature (arguing the two were more intertwined than has previously been suggested); and the history of the relationship between postwar and Cold War. Combining Anglo-American and German literature and film history with critical analysis, cultural history and life-writing, this is a necessarily ambitious, multidisciplinary study which will open up a major new field of research.",
