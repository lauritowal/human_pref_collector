        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks support for an innovative research project aimed at decoding the conceptual underpinnings of India's political life—a domain that remains underexplored despite the country's status as the world's largest democracy and an emerging global power. Recognizing the limitations of Euro-American theoretical frameworks in capturing the essence of India's political dynamics, this project proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the demotic, or common, political ideas that animate the political engagements of ordinary Indian citizens. To achieve this, the project will leverage a multidisciplinary approach, engaging experts in anthropology, history, linguistics, and political science.\n\nThe research will take a cue from the Begriffsgeschichte tradition, which has been instrumental in understanding German political concepts, to conduct an ethnographic and historical examination of India's vernacular political lexicon. Three primary objectives guide this endeavor: firstly, to establish a robust empirical and analytical foundation for a vernacular lexicography of Indian politics; secondly, to create a publicly accessible online Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and thirdly, to engage with scholars in European political thought to discuss the broader implications of these findings on global political theory.\n\nUnder the direction of the Principal Investigator (PI), who has a distinguished track record in studying demotic categories and values within Indian politics, this project promises to deliver significant contributions. It will illuminate overlooked facets of subcontinental politics, expand the methodological horizons of the Begriffsgeschichte framework beyond its European origins, and advance the development of a more inclusive global political theory that resonates with the complex realities of diverse political landscapes across the world."

Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.",
