        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious research agenda to investigate the underpinnings of learning during the earliest stages of human life. Recognizing infants as remarkably adept learners capable of mastering language and complex social interactions in mere months, the proposed study seeks to identify the neural mechanisms that enable such rapid and sophisticated cognitive development. The research postulates that, in addition to powerful statistical learning algorithms, two pivotal elements play crucial roles: the unique human cerebral architecture that guides statistical computations, and the human capacity to engage with complex symbolic systems.\n\nThe proposal delineates six work packages (WPs), designed to leverage the complementary insights provided by non-invasive brain-imaging techniques, including EEG, MRI, and optical topography. These WPs aim to chart the evolution of infant statistical computations and symbolic competence from six months of gestation through the first year of life. WP1 examines the onset of statistical inferences in preterm infants, while WP2 compares the impact of in-utero versus ex-utero environments on early statistical computations and their influence on brain activity. WP3 investigates the neural foundation of infants' word learning and categorization, paying special attention to the left perisylvian regions and their connectivity. WP4 scrutinizes infant symbolic competency through progressive experiments assessing generalization, bidirectionality, algebraic rule application, and logical operations within the first six months of life.\n\nSupplementary WPs focus on methodological enhancements: WP5 integrates MRI to secure precise functional localizations and developmental markers associated with the functional findings, and WP6 focuses on the development of innovative tools for the combination and analysis of multimodal brain imagery. Ultimately, this research aspires to elucidate the distinct neural functional architecture that is vital for human learning from the earliest onset of cortical circuitry."

I propose here that two other elements are crucial. The first is the particular human cerebral architecture that constrains statistical computations. The second is the humanâ€™s ability to access a rich symbolic system. I have planned 6 work packages using the complementary information offered by non-invasive brain-imaging techniques (EEG, MRI and optical topography) to understand the neural bases of infant statistical computations and symbolic competence from 6 months of gestation up until the end of the first year of life. WP1 studies from which preterm age, statistical inferences can be demonstrated using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 investigates the consequences of a different pre-term environment (in-utero versus ex-utero) on the early statistical computations in the visual and auditory domains and their consequences on the ongoing brain activity along the first year of life. WP3 explores the neural bases of how infants infer word meaning and word category, and in particular the role of the left perisylvian areas and of their particular connectivity. WP4 questions infant symbolic competency. I propose several criteria (generalization, bidirectionality, use of algebraic rules and of logical operations) tested in successive experiments to clarify infant symbolic abilities during the first semester of life. WP5-6 are transversal to WP1-4: WP5 uses MRI to obtain accurate functional localization and maturational markers correlated with functional results. In WP6, we develop new tools to combine and analyse multimodal brain images. With this proposal, I hope to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture that are critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits.",
