        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the urgent need to reimagine city logistics (CL) in light of emerging social, economic, and technological shifts that are enhancing the mobility of goods and transforming urban landscapes. Traditional CL frameworks are ill-equipped to handle these changes, as they do not recognize the mobility of goods as a public necessity. Our project, GoodMobility, seeks to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm that prioritizes public value over conventional techno-business-centric approaches.\n\nGoodMobility aims to pioneer 'Logistics as a Service' (LaaS), a concept that envisions a logistics web underpinned by both infrastructure (hardware) and operating procedures (software). Our first objective is to establish a measurement system for public value to guide CL planning and management. This will involve an iterative process utilizing multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization techniques.\n\nThe second objective focuses on the development of LaaS infrastructure design principles, models, and tools. We will create innovative network optimization methods that promise significant efficiency improvements and positively influence stakeholder activities towards maximizing public value.\n\nOur third objective is to construct a theoretical framework for LaaS operating procedures, incorporating logistics markets to enhance efficiency, reliability, and the safeguarding of public value in the logistics demand and supply equation. Advanced learning-based optimization methods will be devised to effectively manage these logistics markets.\n\nThe success of GoodMobility will establish a groundbreaking CL theory with profound scientific and practical benefits. It will introduce transformative ideas and methodologies, fostering new research directions in transport and logistics with extensive societal, economic, and environmental benefits."

Goods are gaining more mobility with drastic implications for cities. The current city logistics (CL) paradigm, which does not consider the mobility of goods a public need, limits our capacity to understand and respond to the challenges and opportunities brought by this profound change. Taking a different perspective, GoodMobility proposes to replace the techno-business-centric smart thinking with network-centric wise logistics that takes the public value as the primary goal and envisions setting up a logistics web with the required infrastructure (hardware) and operating procedures (software) to establish logistics as a service (LaaS). The first objective is to develop public value as a measurement system to assess and guide CL planning and management, which will be achieved with an iterative process, combining multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. The second objective is to develop the principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design. Novel network optimization methods will be developed for designing the hardware of LaaS to provide orders of magnitude efficiency gains and influence the stakeholder activities to maximize public value. The third objective is to develop a theoretical framework and models for the operating procedures of LaaS, introducing the logistics markets to ensure efficiency and reliability and secure public value in matching logistics demand and supply. Learning-based optimization methods will be developed to manage logistics markets. If successful, GoodMobility will lay the foundations of a new theory of CL with significant scientific and practical implications. The novel ideas, concepts, and methodologies will open up new research perspectives in transport and logistics with far-reaching social, economic, and environmental consequences.",
