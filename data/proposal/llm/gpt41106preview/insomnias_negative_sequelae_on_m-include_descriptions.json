        "Abstract:\n\nDepression represents a significant global health concern, with a substantial portion of the population experiencing related symptoms and a distressingly low detection and treatment success rate. To address this, the proposed project focuses on insomnia, a highly prevalent and modifiable risk factor, especially in the elderly. The project builds upon the hypothesis that specific subtypes of insomnia contribute disproportionately to the development of depression, a notion supported by recent innovative research suggesting that these subtypes can be discerned through multivariate analysis and brain imaging.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to identify the 13% of individuals with insomnia who are at extreme risk of depression, to explore the differential mechanisms that distinguish these high-risk individuals from other insomniacs, and to engage them in tailored intervention protocols that emphasize sleep improvement as a preventive measure against depression. The interdisciplinary approach of the project leverages cutting-edge techniques to classify insomnia subtypes, investigate the underlying brain structure and function, psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and environmental factors, and to apply internet-supported, home-based interventions.\n\nBy focusing on early identification, mechanism elucidation, and intervention optimization, this project aims to bridge the gap between mechanistic understanding and practical prevention. The anticipated outcomes include a targeted risk assessment, a comprehensive profile of the mechanisms involved in the transition from insomnia to depression, and the refinement of interventions to bolster sleep quality and stave off depression. This strategy promises to significantly enhance the effectiveness of depression prevention efforts, offering a model for immediate risk-based preventive healthcare delivery and policy development."

Its prevalence is 1-3%, an additional 8-16% have clinically significant symptoms, and prognosis is poor. Unfortunately, less than 20% of the cases are detected and treatment effectiveness is moderate. The Global Consortium for Depression Prevention stresses that our best chance to combat the global burden of depression is provide preventive intervention to identified people at risk. This project targets the strongest modifiable risk factor: insomnia. With prevalence estimates up to 40%, insomnia is among the most frequent disorders in the elderly population. Meta-analysis shows that no less than 13% of people with insomnia develop depression. This extreme risk and the very high prevalence of insomnia in the ageing population, shows the urgency and promise of: (1) early identification of these 13%, (2) finding mechanisms by quantification of how they differ from insomniacs that do not develop depression with respect to brain structure and function, psychological traits, behavioural habits and environmental exposures; and (3) enrolling them in intervention protocols aimed at sleep improvement and prevention of depression. The project extends recent findings emerging from the applicant’s pioneering, unconventional and innovative approach to insomnia; the proposal that distinct subtypes exist and can be discriminated data-driven by means of multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging. Ignorance of this heterogeneity has obstructed progress in mechanistic understanding and rational treatment. In an unprecedented interdisciplinary way the project (1) identifies the insomnia subtype that develops depression; (2) profiles mechanisms involved; and (3) optimizes effectiveness of internet-supported home-applicable interventions to improve sleep and prevent depression. This approach will identify risks and mechanisms, and facilitate immediate implementation of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.",
