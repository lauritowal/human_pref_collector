        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex dynamics of citizenship acquisition and its impact on migrant integration. The proposed research will address critical questions surrounding the role of legal status transitions in the lives of migrants, exploring how these transitions are shaped by individual motivations, contextual factors, and policy environments. The project aims to elucidate the relationship between the path to citizenship and its subsequent 'integration premium' for migrants and their descendants.\n\nCentral to this research is the hypothesis that the benefits of citizenship vary according to the trajectory into legal status and are influenced by the socioeconomic and institutional contexts of both origin and destination countries. This project will employ an innovative analytical framework that models legal status transitions as life course events, taking into account the origin, family context, and societal structures, and institutions that shape these transitions. The research will examine the effects of citizenship on various outcomes such as employment and income levels, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and the educational attainment of migrants' descendants.\n\nMethodologically, the project will introduce novel approaches to analyzing step-to-citizenship trajectories and the impact of policy changes on status transitions. This research will leverage a unique combination of longitudinal register-based and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries, providing a rich comparative context to assess the influence of institutional variation on naturalization processes.\n\nThe findings are expected to inform targeted citizenship policies that maximize settlement success, thereby contributing to the broader understanding of migrant integration and the role of policy in facilitating successful transitions to citizenship. This research holds the potential to shape more effective and equitable immigration strategies, benefiting both migrants and host societies."

A fast-track to citizenship can maximise the potential for settlement success, though too short a pathway can disincentivise integration. Not all migrants have an equal interest in naturalising and some are discouraged by restrictive policies. Yet little is known about why, how and for whom legal status transition matters and, especially, how policy variation impacts on this relation. Which migrants are most discouraged by stricter requirements for naturalisation? For whom carries citizenship the largest pay-off? Does it still matter if a migrant acquires citizenship after a long waiting period? This project combines for the first time the ideas that a) migrants have different motivations to naturalise; b) legal status transitions are conditioned by the institutional and socioeconomic contexts in origin and destination countries and c) the potential ‘integration premium’ associated with naturalisation is conditioned by the trajectory into citizenship. The innovative project contributions are: 1. modelling migrants’ legal status transitions as life course events, which are shaped by migrants’ origin, their family context and societal structures and institutions; 2. analysing the relevance of citizenship for work and income, living conditions, health status and out-migration among immigrants and for educational attainment among their descendants; 3. developing novel methodologies to analyse step-to-citizenship trajectories and the impact of policy changes on status transitions and related outcomes among migrant groups and cohorts; 4. testing models on the basis of a unique combination of longitudinal register-based and survey-based micro-data in 8 European and North American countries, which provide the comparative context to analyse the impact of institutional variation; 5. yielding information for targeted citizenship policies to maximise settlement success for immigrants and their children.",
