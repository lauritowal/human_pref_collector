        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: Care Relocation in Transnational European Contexts**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative anthropological investigation into a burgeoning and contentious trend in European elder care: the relocation of ageing individuals to care homes in Central Eastern Europe where services are significantly more affordable. This phenomenon, often referred to as 'grandmother deportation' or 'geriatric colonialism,' exemplifies the growing marketization of care and the complex interplay between welfare states as care recipients move across national borders within Europe, carrying their entitlements with them.\n\nThe study aims to explore the implications of care relocation on the individuals and regions involved by focusing on care homes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary that attract elderly patients from wealthier nations such as Austria and Germany. These facilities, which offer care at approximately one-third the cost of comparable institutions in the patients' home countries, are situated in areas steeped in German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, thereby adding layers of historical complexity to the current scenario.\n\nThe proposed research, entitled ReloCare, is poised to break new ground by integrating diverse aspects within a single study framework. It will employ in-depth ethnographic approaches to examine the daily life within these care homes, with particular attention to the experiences of the residents. Additionally, the project will delve into the interconnections between care entrepreneurs, state insurance systems, and the historical narratives of regional migration, offering a comprehensive understanding of these emergent transnational entanglements of welfare.\n\nBy considering care relocation as both a consequence of the privatization of care and a facet of future making, ReloCare aspires to shed light on the broader implications of aging and the necessity of care in a Europe that is becoming increasingly interconnected. This research holds the potential to inform future care policies and to address the critical challenges faced by elderly individuals in the evolving landscape of European welfare states."

This project looks at the reverse phenomenon: care relocation, in which the ageing body is relocated to places where care is more affordable. This hotly contested trend, described as ‘grandmother deportation’ or ‘geriatric colonialism’, can be seen as an extreme example of the marketization of care, and entangling welfare states as entitlements are carried across national borders within Europe. This multi-sited anthropological study will take as case studies care homes in Central Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) that recruit patients from Austria and Germany, and offer care at roughly one-third of the cost of similar institutions in the home countries. What does care relocation do to the people and places involved? Most of these care homes are located in regions characterized by a long German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, adding historical complexity to the story. Some serve only German-speaking patients, others serve local, wealthier elderly people as well. They are run by former migrant care workers and by international companies, bringing labour migration and real estate investment into the picture. ReloCare breaks new ground by encompassing all of these aspects in one study. Alongside in-depth ethnographic studies of daily life in these care homes, the researchers will investigate the nexus of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and the histories of places and regional migration, providing an understanding of these new transnational entanglements of welfare states. In perceiving care relocation as both part of future making and a response to the privatization of care landscapes in the region, it asks what it means to become old and in need of care in an increasingly intertwined Europe.",
