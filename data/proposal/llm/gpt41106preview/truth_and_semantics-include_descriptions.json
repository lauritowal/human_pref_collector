        "Abstract:\n\nThe intricate relationship between truth and language is a cornerstone of both philosophical logic and natural language semantics. This project seeks to bridge the gap between these disciplines by providing a comprehensive analysis of how truth-conditional semantics can incorporate the complexities of semantic paradoxes. Traditional semanticists have often overlooked the challenges posed by paradoxical sentences, such as the Liar paradox, which are routinely addressed by philosophical logicians. These paradoxes raise critical questions about the truth-value of statements involving nested assumptions and beliefs. The proposed research aims to rectify this oversight by developing a unified framework that accounts for both truth-conditional semantics and the nuances of self-applicable truth in natural language.\n\nThe project is divided into two synergistic parts: Truth in Semantics and Truth and the Foundations of Semantics. The first part focuses on constructing semantic models for extensive segments of natural language, accommodating not only the concept of truth but also modalities, propositional attitudes, and conditional expressions. The second part takes a metasemantic approach, investigating the foundational role of truth within natural language semantics. This exploration endeavors to reconcile the theoretical solutions to semantic paradoxes with the practical requirements of truth-conditional semantics, aiming to establish a coherent system that accurately reflects the richness of natural language.\n\nThis pioneering study will be the first to systematically tackle the interplay between truth and natural language semantics from a dual perspective. It promises to yield significant insights into the underlying semantic structures that govern communication, offering a novel and robust framework for understanding the nature of truth in language."

Does Anne believe that Bob's assumption is false?\" Don't try too hard answering the question - any straightforward attempt will lead to paradox. But what are we to make of sentences such as \"Anne believes that Bob's assumption is false.\" Is the sentence true or false? On the face of it, it would seem that answering this question is a pressing problem for natural language semantics that assigns truth conditions to sentences of natural language. However, semanticists have largely ignored problems of this kind, leaving the field to philosophical logicians working on paradoxes, in particular, the paradoxes of truth such as the Liar paradox. But research on the paradoxes of truth has often focused on exploring the space of possible coherent \"solutions\" to the paradoxes thereby ignoring desiderata of natural language semantics. The project provides a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics, and the research on the so-called semantic paradoxes in form of theories of self-applicable truth. A unified approach to truth and semantics will need to answer two principal challenges, which divides the research project into two interrelated parts. The first part, Truth in Semantics, aims at developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, that is, fragments in which, besides the notion of truth, we allow for, e.g., modal expressions, propositional attitudes but also natural language conditionals. The second part, Truth and the Foundations of Semantics, assumes a metasemantic perspective and explores the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics. The project constitutes the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from such a combined perspective.",
