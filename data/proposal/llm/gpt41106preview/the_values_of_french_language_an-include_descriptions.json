        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal requests funding for an innovative interdisciplinary project examining the historical interplay between language and identity in Europe, with a focus on the period between 1100 and 1450. The project seeks to investigate the evolution of linguistic borders and the role of languages in shaping European identities, challenging the normative models that have traditionally dominated the narrative of national languages since the 19th century. By exploring the use of French as a supralocal and transnational language during the Middle Ages, the project aims to provide a fresh perspective on its function beyond cultural prestige and as a vehicle for European interconnectedness.\n\nThe central case study of this inquiry is the wide-reaching textual tradition of L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César, a key to medieval conceptions of European history and identity. The project will mobilize an international consortium of scholars with diverse expertise in areas such as codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, creating a cross-national academic dialogue. This collaboration will involve empirical research across various European countries and North America, integrating different intellectual and scholarly traditions.\n\nBy revisiting the historical narratives of linguistic identity, the project not only revisits earlier critiques of the construction of national languages and literary canons, but it also extends its analysis to consider the broader historical context. The ultimate objective is to provide a nuanced understanding of the impact of French as a lingua franca on the development of a European identity during the medieval era. The anticipated outcome is a more comprehensive and international understanding of the dynamics between language use and identity formation, contributing to the ongoing discourse on the roots and evolution of European unity."

What is the relation historically between language and identity in Europe? How are cognate languages demarcated from each other? Normative models of national languages helped shape Europe. Yet they did not become hegemonic until the 19th century. Indeed, they were imposed (not always successfully) on a linguistic map of Europe more fluid and complex than most histories of national languages allow. In the Middle Ages multilingualism was common, as was the use of non-local languages, notably Latin, but also French. This project undertakes a revaluation of the nature and value of the use of French in Europe during a crucial period, 1100-1450, less in terms of its cultural prestige (the traditional focus of scholarship) than of its role as a supralocal, transnational language, particularly in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The project fosters collaboration between, and cuts across, different intellectual and national scholarly traditions, drawing on expertise in codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology; it involves scholars from a range of European countries and North America, entailing empirical research around a complex and widely disseminated textual tradition vital to medieval understandings of European history and identity, L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César. This case study will ground and stimulate broader speculative reflection on the two core questions concerning linguistic identity. While the project builds on prior critiques of the construction of, and investment in, national languages and literary traditions, it has a broad historical scope, and will offer an innovative, genuinely international perspective, in terms of both its object of study and method. Indeed, its final aim, through and beyond its consideration of French as a lingua franca, is to interrogate that language’s role in the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages.",
