        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project is set to explore an under-investigated facet of transgender health: the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy on psychosocial functioning and social relationships. Despite the rising number of individuals in Europe identifying as transgender, and the widespread use of hormone therapy as a form of medical intervention, there is a significant gap in our understanding of how such treatments affect the interpersonal aspects of this population's lives. Addressing this gap is critical, considering the profound influence social relationships have on health and the high prevalence of social challenges and elevated suicide risks among transgender individuals.\n\nThe project pioneers a biopsychosocial approach by integrating insights from social neuroendocrinology, which focuses on the biological effects of hormones, with social psychological and epidemiological perspectives on the roles of psychological and sociocultural factors in health. This innovative model will serve as the foundation for a program of research comprising four work packages that employ a diverse array of research methods. The program is structured around three principal objectives: (A) delineating the causal pathways from hormone therapy to psychosocial outcomes, (B) amplifying the voices of transgender individuals regarding their experiences with hormone therapy and its effects on personal and relational domains, and (C) informing policy and clinical practice to enhance psychosocial and relational well-being within the framework of informed consent models for gender identity services.\n\nBy bridging multiple disciplines, this research initiative aims to be at the vanguard of gender-affirming healthcare, providing empirical evidence to improve the quality of life and social integration of transgender individuals through informed and sensitively-administered hormone therapies."

A crucial oversight in this area is that very little research has examined how gender-affirming hormone therapy, the most common form of medical intervention for transgender people, shapes psychosocial functioning and ultimately social relationship experiences. Given the paramount importance of social relationships to health and well-being, evidence for psychosocial effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy is vital to ensuring health equity for transgender people, who suffer from alarmingly high rates of social disruption and suicide risk. I draw together independent strands of research on biological effects of hormones from social neuroendocrinology and health influences of psychological and sociocultural factors from social psychology and epidemiology to propose a novel biopsychosocial model linking gender-affirming hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning in transgender people. Drawing upon this model, I propose a programme of research involving four complementary work packages, triangulating across a variety of novel and cutting-edge research methods. This work will be guided by three key aims: A) to isolate causal pathways from a biopsychosocial model linking gender-affirming hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning, B) to empower transgender people to give voice to their own personal and relational experiences in the context of gender-affirming hormone therapy, and, C) to guide policy and practice for gender identity services in line with the informed consent model, directing focus to the improvement of psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes. This interdisciplinary programme of research will sit at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare and treatment for transgender people.",
