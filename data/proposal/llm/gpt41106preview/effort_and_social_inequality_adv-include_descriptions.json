        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project focused on dissecting the role of effort in perpetuating social inequality. Acknowledging the wealth of data on cognitive abilities provided by large-scale assessments such as PISA, this study addresses the significant gap concerning socio-economic disparities in cognitive effort. By delving into the social antecedents of effort, the project endeavors to advance our understanding of intergenerational mobility and enhance equality of opportunity.\n\nThe research is structured around three core questions: Firstly, it aims to quantify the variation in effort levels among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Secondly, it investigates whether these disparities in effort can be attributed to the influence of parents' effort levels and children's motivations, including their responses to incentives. Thirdly, the project seeks to evaluate the efficacy of various effort measurement techniques across scientific disciplines, identifying their respective strengths and limitations.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will employ innovative methods, such as real-effort tasks and psychophysiological tools like pupillometry, which have been underutilized in the context of inequality research. Data will be collected from a substantial cohort of school-aged children and their parents in Spain and Germany. Additionally, subjective effort dispositions will be analyzed through national and international survey data.\n\nBy integrating a range of methodological approaches, the research promises to yield the first robust insights into socio-economic differences in effort, paving the way for subsequent studies on related dimensions such as gender and ethnicity. Cross-validation analyses will further ensure the accuracy of prevalent effort measures. The anticipated outcomes are set to have profound implications for educational stakeholders, contribute to normative discussions on social inequality, and inform evidence-based policy-making."

While large-scale test programs like PISA have produced impressive amounts of data on the determinants of cognitive abilities, there is scant evidence on socio-economic differences in cognitive effort. Better understanding the social origins of effort pushes the frontier of knowledge on intergenerational mobility and allows improving equality of opportunity. Specifically, the aim of the project is to answer three research questions: 1. To what extent do childrenâ€™s effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background? (descriptive component) 2. Can existing disparities in effort by social background be explained by (a) the intergenerational transmission of effort from parents to children, and (b) varying motivations and differential susceptibility to incentives? (analytical component) 3. What are the best techniques to measure cognitive effort and what are the strengths and weaknesses of measures routinely used in different scientific disciplines? (methodological component) The project will develop and exploit cutting-edge methods of effort measurement such as real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry. Their immense potential has remained untapped in inequality research thus far. Experimental data will be collected for a large sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. Subjective effort dispositions will be further analyzed using (inter)national surveys. The triangulation of carefully chosen methodologies will provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and stimulate new research (e.g. on gender or ethnic differentials in effort). Cross-validation analysis will detect possible biases of commonly used effort measures. The research findings will provide valuable insights for educational practitioners and decisive evidence for normative debates about social inequality and policy design.",
