        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the understanding of the complex role of motivation in human cognition and its neural underpinnings. Motivation, a pivotal psychological construct, is known to energize behavior and influence various cognitive operations, including conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. These cognitive processes are often impaired in neurological and psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with dysfunctions in the dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems. These systems are also implicated in the cognitive enhancements imparted by extrinsic rewards in healthy individuals. Despite its significance, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of how reward specifically modifies cognitive functions and the corresponding neural mechanisms.\n\nThe proposed research aims to establish a unified conceptual and neural framework to elucidate the influence of rewards on cognition. To do so, it will integrate additional factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control and response modes, and the processing of irrelevant information. The proposal emphasizes the necessity of employing advanced neuroimaging techniques to non-invasively investigate neural activity within the DA and NA systems, ensuring precise and reliable data collection.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research will significantly enhance theoretical knowledge in psychology and neuroscience, particularly in relation to the role of motivation. Furthermore, the insights garnered from this study will have broad implications for the understanding and treatment of various clinical conditions where motivation and related cognitive functions are compromised. With its potential to bridge gaps between basic research and clinical applications, this work promises to contribute substantially to both scientific knowledge and societal well-being."

Beyond globally energizing behavior, recent studies have begun to describe effects of extrinsic reward on various specific cognitive operations like conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. Intriguingly, these functions appear to be disturbed in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease. On the neural level, these disorders have been related to disturbances in the dopaminergic (DA) and/or the noradrenergic (NA) system, which are the very same systems that are also thought to be vital for the cognitive benefits of reward observed in the healthy mind. Despite this central, probably interrelated, role in the healthy and the diseased mind, our understanding of how exactly reward impacts specific cognitive operations is still rudimentary, both on the level of psychological theory as well as concerning the underlying neural mechanisms. The aim of this proposal is to develop a novel unifying conceptual and neural framework of how reward influences human cognition. To achieve this goal, it is essential to extend our conceptual understanding of the nature of such reward effects by integrating additional interrelated factors, such as stimulus saliency, different cognitive-control and response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. In order to match this conceptual progress at the neuromechanistic level, it is critical to employ optimized neuroimaging methods that allow for a reliable, yet non-invasive investigation of neural activity in the source and target regions of the DA and NA system. Given the critical role of motivation in the healthy and the diseased mind, the results will provide new valuable insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research.",
