        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses critical challenges within the teaching profession, including its declining appeal, fragmentation, and ongoing teacher shortages, through a novel comparative research endeavor in Europe. The proposed project is groundbreaking in its systematic approach to examining the institutional factors influencing teacher careers and the profession at large. It aims to achieve four key objectives: (1) to dissect teacher policies over the past three decades across Belgium, France, and England; (2) to assess the evolving status of the teaching profession and the resultant effects on workforce diversification; (3) to scrutinize the allocation processes of teachers under varying professional conditions; and (4) to construct and forecast patterns of teacher attrition and migration through a differentiated multilevel framework.\n\nEmploying a post-comparative mixed-method design, the research is structured into four interconnected work packages focusing on policies, supply, labour markets, and mobility related to the teaching profession. Methodologies include policy analysis of teacher recruitment and career progression; exploration of national and international datasets for insights into teacher supply and attractiveness; qualitative examinations of three distinct national labour markets; multilevel analyses utilizing original datasets on teacher mobility; and semi-structured interviews with individuals who have either not entered or prematurely exited the teaching profession.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are twofold: to generate novel theoretical knowledge regarding teacher labour markets, and to contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of institutional change within educational systems. This project is particularly relevant in the context of diminishing nation-state influence, growing societal interdependencies, and the increasing fragmentation of individual life spheres."

The functioning of the profession suffers from low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This proposal constitutes the first systematic comparative project in Europe aimed at understanding the role of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the teaching profession as a whole. It has four objectives: [1] to explain the nature of teacher policy over the last thirty years in different educational systems (Belgium, France and England); [2] to understand the changing status of the teaching profession and its impact on the diversification of the teaching workforce; [3] to analyse the processes by which teachers are allocated into increasingly diverse working and professional conditions; and [4] to model and predict teacher attrition and migration within a common but differentiated multilevel framework. This project will adopt a post-comparative mixed-method design organized around four work packages on teacher policy, supply, labour markets and mobility. It will combine five methods: policy analysis of teachers’ recruitment and careers; secondary data analyses of relevant national and international datasets on teacher supply and the profession’s attractiveness; a qualitative, in-depth study of three national labour-market spaces; multilevel multi-group analyses of original datasets on teacher mobility, and semi-structured interviews with non-entrants and early leavers. This project will produce new theoretical knowledge about labour markets for teachers and contribute to the reconceptualization of the nature of institutional change affecting educational systems in a society characterized by the progressive decline of nation states, increased interdependence between societal fields and the fragmentation of individual life spheres.",
