        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the multifaceted causes behind the rise of populism in advanced democracies, focusing on the potential role of economic shocks and the differential responses they elicit. The research will explore how personal experiences, the information environment, and the interplay with economic events shape political behavior and the embrace of populist ideologies. Utilizing novel and expansive datasets, the study consists of three distinct yet interconnected parts.\n\nThe first segment analyzes the impact of personal employment history, influenced by globalization and technological changes, on voting patterns, specifically in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Leveraging an unparalleled database of over 40 million resumes from U.S. job-seekers, matched with local economic and voting data, this portion of the study seeks to illuminate the relationship between individual economic experiences and the support for Donald Trump.\n\nSecondly, the project examines the long-term effects of negative social experiences, such as corporal punishment during formative years, on labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and support for the populist agenda in the UK. By digitizing and analyzing archival records of corporal punishment practices and regulations from the 1970s-80s and correlating them with contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, and political leanings, the study will provide insights into the social roots of populism.\n\nThe third part investigates the factors that drive individuals to resist extremist regimes, despite substantial personal risks, using the historical context of resistance to the Nazi regime in WWII Germany. This component utilizes a unique dataset of treason cases, complemented by information on bombings and exposure to foreign propaganda, to understand the determinants of opposition to extremism under high-stakes conditions.\n\nCollectively, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the genesis of populist movements and the resilience of democratic institutions in the face of economic and social crises."

Is populism caused by negative economic shocks? If so, what are the mechanisms? What explains heterogeneity in responses to such shocks? In this project, I will test empirically if personal experiences, information environment, and their interaction with aggregate economic shocks shape peopleâ€™s political decisions. The project consists of three parts. First, I will study how personal employment histories, potentially affected by globalization and technological shocks, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting for Trump. I will use a unique database of more than 40 million resumes for the period 2010-2016, the largest available repository of resumes of job-seekers in the US, which was not previously used in academic research, and match it with zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, I will study how negative social experiences during the formative years affect subsequent labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and the support of populist agenda. I will examine how corporal punishment in schools in UK affected subsequent educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting for UKIP and Brexit. I will digitize archival records on regulations and practice of corporal punishment in different educational authorities in the UK during 1970-80s, combining it with contemporary outcomes. Third, I will examine what makes people actively resist extremist regimes even when it is associated with high personal costs. I will study a historical example of resistance to Nazi regime in Germany during the WWII, which provides unique methodological opportunity to study determinants of resistance to extremism in a high stake environment. I will use a self-collected dataset on treason cases to measure resistance, combining it with data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda.",
