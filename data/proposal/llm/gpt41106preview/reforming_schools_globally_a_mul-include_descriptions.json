    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the face of global economic challenges, educational systems worldwide are undergoing significant transformations to enhance their effectiveness. Central to this transformation is the adoption of school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, which are rapidly becoming a global model for educational reform. Despite the widespread implementation of SAWA and endorsements from leading educational organizations like the OECD, there remains a critical lack of understanding about their dissemination and efficacy. The proposed research project, REFORMED, seeks to fill this gap by investigating why SAWA policies are gaining international traction, the degree to which they promote policy convergence in education, and the varying conditions under which they are effective.\n\nThe research will delve into the mechanisms of policy adoption, re-formulation by diverse educational actors, and the institutional and contextual factors that influence SAWA outcomes at the school level. Given the inconclusive evidence regarding SAWA's impact on learning outcomes and equity, REFORMED's comprehensive approach is particularly timely. This project will employ a cutting-edge, multi-scalar methodology, integrating both quantitative and qualitative research techniques to provide a nuanced analysis of global education policy stages, from conceptualization to real-world application and consequences.\n\nREFORMED's findings are poised to offer valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and international organizations, contributing to the refinement of educational reforms and promoting policies that are both effective and equitable. This research will not only elucidate the global dynamics of SAWA policies but also inform the future direction of educational systems in a rapidly changing world economy."

In this scenario, managerial policy ideas such as school autonomy and accountability, which aim to modernize public education and strengthen its performance, are spreading broadly. To date, a wide range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development have adopted school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, whilst the most active international organizations in the education sector, like the OECD, are strongly promoting them globally. Constituting SAWA as a global model of education reform generates two main questions. First, why and how are SAWA policies disseminating globally, and to what extent does this reform model generate international policy convergence in education? Secondly, how and under what particular contextual and institutional circumstances do SAWA policies work and for whom? The fact that existing scholarly research has achieved inconclusive and mixed findings concerning the SAWA effects on learning outcomes and equity makes this second question especially relevant. To address these gaps in existing literature, REFORMED develops a comprehensive research approach that scrutinizes the different, but mutually constitutive stages of global education policy, from the inception in global agendas stage to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. Specifically, the project analyzes how and why SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors operating at different scales (from international bureaucrats to teachers), and inquires into the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that explain the different effects of SAWA at the school level. A robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods will contribute to advancing such an innovative approach.",
