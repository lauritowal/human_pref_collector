        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe urgent need to enhance ocean sustainability through marine spatial planning (MSP) that explicitly integrates climate change considerations is at the forefront of marine conservation efforts. The PLAnT initiative aims to pioneer this approach by focusing on Antarctica, a region where MSP is notably absent yet critically needed. As the Antarctic environment undergoes rapid transformations with global implications, such as sea-level rise and changes in marine ecosystems, the development of a climate-smart MSP framework is imperative. The proposed project will address the significant gap in current MSP practices that fail to account for climate variability, leading to maladaptive and inefficient outcomes.\n\nPLAnT's innovative approach will involve a comprehensive assessment of social-ecological vulnerabilities, the creation of future scenarios, the advocacy for area-based climate action, and the implementation of dynamic solutions. A thorough governance analysis will be conducted to understand and navigate the unique challenges faced in the integration of climate-smart strategies into MSP, acknowledging the political, social, and economic idiosyncrasies that influence effectiveness. The project endeavors to promote a paradigm shift in sustainable and equitable planning under the pressures of climate change.\n\nWhile acknowledging that research on complex social-ecological systems may yield context-specific solutions, the PLAnT project is designed to have a broader impact. The insights and methodologies developed will not only be applicable to Antarctica but will also serve as a model to inspire nations globally in their pursuit of sustainable ocean management. This initiative represents a critical step forward in aligning MSP with the pressing climate objectives outlined in the international sustainability agenda, marking a transformative contribution to global marine conservation efforts."

However, few existing marine spatial planning (MSP) initiatives consider climate change explicitly. This is a critical oversight in a rapidly changing world. At the same time, no formal MSP initiatives are envisioned for Antarctica; it is the only ocean basin globally without MSP under development. Antarctica is changing rapidly with potential repercussions around the planet, particularly for sea-level rise, climate regulation, and marine ecosystems functioning. Developing integrated, sustainable MSP for Antarctica is now more fundamental than ever. Excluding climate effects from MSP will lead to plans that are maladaptive and inefficient in sustaining marine ecosystems and their use under change. By contrast, if designed with climate objectives, MSP can provide substantial benefits while requiring few trade-offs. Efforts must be thus put together to effectively move towards climate-smart MSP in Antarctica and globally. Yet, contextual idiosyncrasies (political, social, economic) limit the effectiveness of such efforts. Understanding what challenges hinder the development of climate-smart MSP, in Antarctica and globally, and pointing ways to overcome such challenges is key. PLAnT will take up, for the very first time, such critical task. It will assess social-ecological vulnerabilities; build future scenarios; support area-based climate action and dynamic solutions; conduct governance analyses; and foster a paradigm shift on how to plan for sustainability and equity under change. Research on complex social-ecological systems rarely leads to one-size solutions, and there is a risk that solutions identified in PLAnT are context specific. Still, PLAnT will inspire nations worldwide to finding pathways and solutions to support ocean sustainability. At a time when the latter is firmly established in the international agenda, taking a leap forward on this topic is ground-breaking.",
