        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe quest to decipher the enigmatic nature of consciousness remains a formidable scientific endeavor. Consciousness is peculiar in its construction of a coherent experience that is seemingly delayed in its occurrence, raising questions about its role in driving actions and thoughts. The Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project seeks to illuminate this paradox, exploring the functional significance of consciousness in adaptive behavior, its neuronal underpinnings, and its embodiment within neuromorphic robotics. CDAC hypothesizes that the evolutionary shift from surviving in a rudimentary environment to navigating a world populated with intentional agents necessitates sophisticated control systems. These must integrate parallel, distributed processing for real-time responsiveness with a higher-order, sequential control that engenders coherence, encapsulating the essence of consciousness.\n\nThe project proposes a groundbreaking framework that surpasses current scientific models, implementing system-level models of conscious architecture. It involves a rigorous computational examination of the neuronal substrate, empirical validation through experiments with humanoid robots and clinical studies involving stroke patients, and the development of cutting-edge tools to match its ambitious goals. By systematically dissecting the function and origins of consciousness, CDAC positions itself to revolutionize our comprehension of the mind and brain. The project's outcomes have far-reaching implications, promising to foster novel neurorehabilitation methods and spearhead a new epoch of robots endowed with advanced social skills. CDAC is a bold stride towards answering one of the most profound questions in science, with the potential to transform our interaction with technology and deepen our understanding of human cognition."

Did evolution render solutions to the challenge of survival that includes epiphenomenal processes? The Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project aims at resolving this paradox by using a multi-disciplinary approach to show the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behaviour, to identify its underlying neuronal principles and to construct a neuromorphic robot based real-time conscious architecture. CDAC proposes that the shift from surviving in a physical world to one that is dominated by intentional agents requires radically different control architectures combining parallel and distributed control loops to assure real-time operation together with a second level of control that assures coherence through sequential coherent representation of self and the task domain, i.e. consciousness. This conscious scene is driving dedicated credit assignment and planning beyond the immediately given information. CDAC advances a comprehensive framework progressing beyond the state of the art and will be realized using system level models of a conscious architecture, detailed computational studies of its underlying neuronal substrate focusing, empirical validation with a humanoid robot and stroke patients and the advancement of beyond state of the art tools appropriate to the complexity of its objectives. The CDAC project directly addresses one of the main outstanding questions in science: the function and genesis of consciousness and will advance our understanding of mind and brain, provide radically new neurorehabilitation technologies and contribute to realizing a new generation of robots with advanced social competence.",
