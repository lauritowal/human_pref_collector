        "Abstract:\n\nGlobally, nutrient deficiencies afflict two billion individuals, an issue not fully addressed by current food security policies that prioritize caloric sufficiency over dietary quality. This proposal introduces an innovative research project aimed at elucidating the vital but underappreciated role of forests in enhancing dietary diversity and quality among the rural poor. The research will challenge the predominant agricultural-centric narrative by exploring the socio-ecological interplay at the forest-agriculture interface, thereby fostering a paradigm shift towards a more holistic understanding of food security.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold. Firstly, it will conduct a broad-scale analysis to identify correlations between forest alterations and dietary changes, pinpointing hotspots where both forest cover loss and diet quality deterioration intersect. This will be achieved by integrating household food consumption data with forest metrics derived from comprehensive longitudinal datasets. Secondly, the project will construct a detailed framework outlining the connections between forest ecosystems and nutritional outcomes, thereby uncovering the underlying mechanisms of these relationships. Lastly, the research will delve into the local dynamics by conducting in-depth fieldwork within selected sites in two low-income countries, seeking to establish direct causal links between forest resources and dietary quality.\n\nThis pioneering approach leverages a multi-country, multi-scale, and data-intensive methodology to provide the first generalizable empirical evidence on how forest landscapes contribute to nutrition. The results are expected to be transformative, offering a new lens through which to view and address food security challenges. By integrating forest conservation and management into the strategies for combating nutrient deficiencies, the project seeks not only to influence policy and academic discourse but also to catalyze a more sustainable and nutrition-sensitive pathway to food security for the most vulnerable populations."

Dietary diversification is key to solving this problem, yet food security policy, especially in low-income countries, still focuses on increasing agricultural production and access to sufficient calories as the main solution. But calories are not all equal. Indeed, this approach has created a blind spot with respect to the role of forests, which are often overlooked but may be important for dietary diversification for the rural poor by providing wild foods, high-value products which can be sold and thereby enable food purchases, and fodder for livestock which then provide meat, milk and eggs as well as manure to improve agricultural production. This project will identify how forest loss and fragmentation affect people’s dietary quality. I will apply a cutting-edge multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach. First, I will take a broad-scale perspective to explore where forest loss, forest fragmentation, and dietary changes are taking place and identify hotspots of forest change and deteriorating diets. To do so, I will spatially link publicly available household data on food consumption, with metrics on the proportion and spatial arrangement of forest from longitudinal datasets. Second, I will unravel the mechanisms linking forests and diets to develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages. Third, I will zoom in on selected sites in two countries and use in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes locally. The project will break new ground by providing the first generalizable empirical evidence of how and why forests influence dietary quality in low-income countries, thereby laying the ground for a shift in how we think about pathways to food security – that is, to move from conceptualizing food security as driven by agriculture alone to seeing it as dependent on socio-ecological interactions at the forest-agriculture nexus.",
