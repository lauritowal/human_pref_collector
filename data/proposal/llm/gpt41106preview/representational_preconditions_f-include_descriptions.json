        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the underpinnings and operational frameworks of the cognitive mechanisms responsible for understanding other minds, a foundational aspect of human social cognition. The project's innovative trajectory departs from traditional 'theory-of-mind' research, which has predominantly characterized the capacity to attribute mental states to others as a conscious and developmentally mature skill, primarily utilized to rationalize behaviors. Contrary to this, our proposal posits that the processes of monitoring and representing mental states are, in fact, largely automatic and integral to real-time social engagements.\n\nThe proposed research will rigorously test a groundbreaking theoretical perspective suggesting that these mechanisms are not only effortless but also evident at remarkably early stages of human development. This assertion is supported by emergent studies, including our own preliminary findings, which indicate that even infants as young as seven months can inherently compute the beliefs of others, doing so even without explicit task demands.\n\nOur research agenda aims to dissect the functional sub-components and precipitating conditions that enable young infants to exhibit advanced belief computation capabilities, and to trace the progression of these abilities throughout development. Additionally, we will examine the theoretical implications of our hypothesis that this specialized system is optimally adapted for cooperative and communicative interactions, challenging existing paradigms within the field.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are poised to transform our understanding of early cognitive development and the evolution of social cognition. Illuminating the innate capacities for mental state representation will not only redefine theoretical frameworks but also have practical implications for educational strategies, developmental disorder interventions, and artificial intelligence systems designed to mimic human social processing."

We aim to explore and shed new theoretical light on the basic cognitive and brain mechanisms of the human social mind. One of these mechanisms that has received much attention by earlier approaches to ‘theory-of-mind’ research concerns the ability to infer and represent the mental states of others. Standard theories and research in the last twenty five years have suggested that representing other’s beliefs is an effortful and late developing capacity (Wellman et al., 2001) whose main function is to explain others’ behavior. Here we advance and propose to explore a new theoretical perspective according to which the mechanisms of mental state monitoring and representation involve primarily automatic and effortless processes grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Our approach is part of an on-going paradigm change in the field of theory-of-mind research motivated by the recent evidence showing that infants in their second year understand mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). Our own research has gone a significant step further by demonstrating that these mechanisms are present as early as 7 month of age, and by showing that both young infants and adults seem to automatically compute others’ beliefs even in situations where they are not required to do so (Kovács et al, in press Science). The present project explores the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants’ powerful belief computation abilities and to chart their developmental unfolding. Furthermore, we shall explore the implications of the new theoretical proposal that this dedicated system presupposes as its proper domain the on-going collaborative and communicative interactions.",
