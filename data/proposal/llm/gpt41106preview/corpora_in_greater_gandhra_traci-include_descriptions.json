    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking research project on the early development of Buddhist literature, focusing on newly discovered manuscript collections from Greater Gandhāra—a region that historically encompasses parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India. Utilizing a holistic approach, the project aims to analyze two significant caches of early Buddhist Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts. The first set of manuscripts was uncovered at the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan, while the second resided within a private collection in Thailand.\n\nAs one of the select scholars with access to these precious materials, the project leader will spearhead a comprehensive investigation into the textual and material aspects of these manuscripts, exploring their production, transmission, and interrelationships within the broader manuscript cultures of the first millennium CE. The research methodology will integrate philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical analyses to shed new light on the complex networks of Buddhist literary tradition.\n\nA significant outcome of this research will be the establishment of a digital archive, which will include the development of an innovative akṣara database. This tool will catalog individual syllables to reveal unique scribal identifiers, enabling the identification of specific scribes across various manuscripts and scriptoriums. Additionally, the archive will ensure the digital preservation of the manuscripts, alongside their scholarly editions and translations. It will also facilitate the study of their textual, paleographical, and codicological features and permit the direct comparison of their content with parallel texts in multiple languages.\n\nUltimately, this project promises to make a substantial contribution to the understanding of early Buddhist literary culture, providing an invaluable resource for scholars and advancing the field of Buddhist studies."

In the last several years, fantastic manuscript finds have surfaced opening new windows into the scholarly study of the development of Buddhist literature. I am one of the few scholars to have access to such material. This project represents a multifaceted, holistic approach to the study of an important and voluminous genre of manuscript witnesses from an early era of Buddhist textual transmission composed in Sanskrit in the Gilgit/Bamiyan type scripts from the historic region of Greater Gandhāra covering modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Northern India. This project centers the study of two large, recently discovered caches of highly important early Buddhist Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts and their place in the body of works from Greater Gandhāra. The first cache was excavated from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and the second is a collection of newly identified manuscripts held in a private collection in Thailand. The philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research conducted in this project will examine textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks in the Buddhist manuscript cultures of Greater Gandhāra and beyond in the first millennium of the Common Era. These results will be made permanently available through the development of a digital archive allowing for the creation of an akṣara database of individual syllables representing unique scribal identifiers, which will identify individual scribes across manuscripts and scriptorium networks, digital preservation of the manuscripts, their editions and translations, study of their textual, paleographical, and codicological features, and the direct comparison of the content of these texts with parallels in multiple languages.",
