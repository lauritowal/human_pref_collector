        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal investigates a critical, yet understudied phase in human development known as the \"missing middle\" – the period between early infancy and adulthood. Grounded in the \"fetal origins hypothesis,\" which suggests that early life conditions exert a profound influence on long-term human capital outcomes, this research seeks to enhance our understanding of how early shocks and interventions shape health and human capital during childhood. The project leverages a unique opportunity provided by high-quality administrative data from Spain, spanning 35 years, to examine the causal effects of various public policies and environmental factors on child development.\n\nUtilizing advanced econometric techniques and substantial sample sizes, the study will focus on five distinct early childhood shocks, examining their impact on children's health and cognitive development up to age 15. These shocks include changes in household material resources via a mother's allowance, parental time through subsidized paternity leave, medical interventions such as elective delivery, access to family planning services, and economic fluctuations affecting different sectors. The effects of these shocks will be measured using health records, academic performance, and standardized test scores.\n\nIn addition to quantifying the effects, the research will explore potential mechanisms connecting these early life conditions to developmental outcomes, including family dynamics, parental time allocation, labor market participation, and expenditure patterns. The findings from this study will not only fill a significant gap in economic literature but also carry direct policy implications, offering evidence-based insights into the most cost-effective strategies for enhancing young children's future prospects. This research represents a pivotal step toward informing targeted interventions aimed at fostering optimal human capital development from a young age."

However, we still know little about the years in between early infancy and adulthood, referred to as the “missing middle”. How do early shocks affect health and human capital formation during childhood? How do the effects of different types of interventions, or shocks at different ages, compare? What are the most cost-effective ways of improving young children’s future outcomes? I aim to fill this gap in the literature by taking advantage of a range of natural experiments in a country, Spain, for which high quality administrative data are available for the past 35 years. State of the art econometric techniques, combined with large sample sizes, will allow me to evaluate credibly and precisely the causal effects of a number of different public policies and shocks on child development. I will consider five different “shocks” in early childhood (at different ages), affecting: i) Household material resources (an unconditional mother’s allowance); ii) Parental time (subsidized paternity leave); iii) Medical treatments around birth (elective delivery); iv) The availability of family planning services (access to abortion); and v) Aggregate demand shocks to different sectors of the economy. I will evaluate their impact on health and cognitive development at ages 0-15, as measured in hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores, among other data sources. I will also study the potential channels linking treatments to child outcomes, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, expenditure patterns, etc. My results will help us understand how shocks in early life can have long-term effects on human capital, with direct policy implications.",
