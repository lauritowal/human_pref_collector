        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to bridge a critical knowledge gap in understanding the linkage between cellular-level neurochemical changes induced by acute stress and their translation to alterations in large-scale neural systems that govern higher-order cognitive processes. Building on the premise that acute stress precipitates dynamic shifts in network balance, the proposed research seeks to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of resource allocation within the brain's extensive networks during stress episodes and subsequent recovery phases.\n\nThe first objective is to utilize cutting-edge network connectivity models to map these shifts, employing wearable biosensors and mobile technology to pinpoint neural markers predictive of stress resilience in real-world scenarios. The second objective focuses on validating these markers within a patient demographic with heightened stress sensitivity, thus ensuring clinical relevance. \n\nSubsequently, the research will dissect the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in facilitating rapid network transitions. This will provide an understanding of the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying cognitive disruption during stress. The fourth aspect of the study hypothesizes that cognitive functions dependent on specific networks are vulnerable to interference when resources are reallocated to different networks in response to stress.\n\nThe final innovative component of this project aims to design and implement a functional MRI neurofeedback intervention. This intervention will be based on network models and will train individuals with stress sensitivity to adaptively manage neural resources in the face of acute stressors.\n\nThe successful execution of this research promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into the brain's adaptation to stress, establish ecologically valid biomarkers for stress resilience, and pioneer an intervention technique with the potential to enhance stress resilience across various psychiatric conditions."

Repeated exposure to stressors is furthermore a critical transdiagnostic factor in etiology, relapse, and chronification in almost all psychiatric disorders. We know from animal work at the cellular level how stressors trigger a neurochemical cascade that alters properties of widespread neuronal populations. A critical gap in our knowledge, however, is how such cellular effects translate to the level of large-scale neural systems which implement higher-order cognition. Here, I propose a novel framework for understanding such alterations as shifts in network balance: I hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at the level of large-scale networks. First, I will leverage recent advances in network connectivity modeling to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of such shifts during acute stress and recovery. Using wearable biosensors and mobile applications, I aim to identify which neural markers predict resilience to stress in real life. Second, I will cross-validate these markers in a patient group characterized by high stress sensitivity. Third, to investigate how rapid network shifts are generated, I will examine the distinct roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems. Fourth, I will test the hypothesis that cognitive functions supported by one network can be disrupted by shifting balance towards another. Finally, I will develop a network-based implementation of functional MRI neurofeedback to train stress-sensitive participants to adaptively reallocate neural resources during acute stress. When successful, this project will yield 1) unprecedented insight into how our brain adapts to acute stress; 2) novel ecologically validated transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience versus sensitivity; and 3) a potentially groundbreaking method for training stress resilience.",
