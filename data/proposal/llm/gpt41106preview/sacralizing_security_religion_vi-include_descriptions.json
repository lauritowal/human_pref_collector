        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis proposal requests funding for SACRASEC, a pioneering research project designed to investigate the complex interplay of religion and vigilantism within the governance structures of mega-cities in the Global South. In regions where state capacity is insufficient, religious vigilante groups have become de facto authoritative entities, influencing security and order without the explicit aim of overthrowing existing state power. Unlike religious fundamentalists or terrorists, these groups seek neither a global stage for their acts of violence nor a total regime change. Rather, they operate alongside official agencies, filling governance voids and often gaining the acceptance of local populations.\n\nThe proposed study aims to answer two critical questions: Why do residents of these mega-cities confer legitimacy upon religious vigilante organizations? And what role does religion play in the sanctioning of their practices? To address these queries, SACRASEC will conduct ethnographic comparisons across three mega-cities: Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakartaâ€”each presenting a mix of religious traditions, including Christian, Afro-Brazilian, Islamic, and Indigenous beliefs. \n\nBy examining the production of authority among religious vigilantes, our research will provide nuanced insights into the particularities of religious traditions and their influence on alternative forms of governance. The comparative nature of the study will allow for broad conclusions about the general role of religion in non-state governance while respecting the unique context of each city.\n\nThe outcomes of SACRASEC will significantly advance the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, providing vital knowledge on power dynamics in mega-cities of the Global South. This understanding is crucial for informing policy decisions aimed at enhancing human security in these urban environments."

In such contexts, religious organizations and non-state security actors (vigilantes) have merged into alternative governance organizations. The emergence of religious vigilantes suggests a different connection between religion and violence than emphasized in current research on religious fundamentalism and terrorism. While religious vigilantes use violence systematically, they generally do not aim to overthrow the state, nor do they seek a global audience to witness their violence. They operate side-by-side with state actors to maintain order. Major questions are: why do mega-city residents grant these religious vigilantes authority? And what is the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices? SACRASEC will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes in mega-cities of the Global South through an ethnographic comparison of three mega-cities. The case studies focus on Christian and Afro-Brazilian religion in Rio de Janeiro; Christian, Islamic and Indigenous religion in Lagos; and Islamic and Indigenous religion in Jakarta. This comparative focus makes it possible to draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, while also enabling an analysis of the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. This research extends the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology. It will provide critically needed knowledge on the power structures in mega-cities of the Global South, and in so doing will contribute important insights to policies aimed at improving human security.",
