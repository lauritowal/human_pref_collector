        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe WEALTHTRAJECT project represents a pioneering initiative aimed at exploring the complexities of wealth accumulation across different social strata with a longitudinal approach. With wealth disparity escalating in numerous prosperous nations, the project posits that a paradigm shift is necessaryâ€”from the conventional static analysis of wealth differences to a dynamic exploration of individuals' wealth trajectories over time. This shift highlights the diverse paths of wealth accumulation, acknowledging variations in trajectory patterns.\n\nThe project's groundbreaking objectives are multifaceted: Firstly, it seeks to map the variability in wealth trajectories throughout an individual's life course. Secondly, it aims to uncover the intragenerational factors contributing to these diverse wealth trajectories. Thirdly, it endeavors to discern the intergenerational influences of family background on wealth accumulation patterns. Lastly, WEALTHTRAJECT aspires to gather innovative life history data concerning wealth trajectories.\n\nChallenging the traditional notion of a monolithic, hump-shaped model of life cycle wealth accumulation, WEALTHTRAJECT adopts a novel methodology that emphasizes individualized patterns of wealth changes. By synergizing longitudinal survey and registry data with newly acquired life history wealth data, the project promises to chart wealth trajectories over extensive periods, an endeavor not previously undertaken.\n\nEmploying sophisticated quantitative techniques, WEALTHTRAJECT will exploit these rich datasets to their full potential, setting the stage for a redefined understanding of wealth inequality. This enhanced comprehension is critical for the development of targeted social policies that more effectively address the growing disparities in wealth. WEALTHTRAJECT not only promises significant contributions to the academic discourse on economic inequality but also provides a data-driven foundation for informed policymaking."

Wealth inequality is on the rise in many affluent societies. It is time to move beyond prevailing static snapshots of average wealth inequality between people to understand this trend. Instead, a dynamic perspective on wealth changes experienced by people over their lifetimes is needed. This dynamic perspective reveals how diverse the trajectories of wealth accumulation are, i.e., the degree of trajectory variability. WEALTHTRAJECT integrates disconnected strands of literature to study how variability in trajectories emerges over time through the interplay of saving and spending of income, receipt of transfers from parents and other family members, and (de-)investment in (un-)profitable assets. WEALTHTRAJECT addresses four main innovative objectives: (i) to document variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives; (ii) to identify intragenerational drivers of variability in wealth trajectories; (iii) to establish the intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories; (iv) to collect novel life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories. To address these objectives, WEALTHTRAJECT innovates by adopting a novel approach emphasising the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses in people's lives. The project challenges the prevalent idea of a uniform hump-shaped life cycle accumulation pattern in wealth. WEALTHTRAJECT breaks new ground by combining longitudinal data from surveys and registers and original life history data on wealth that, for the first time, allow the mapping of wealth trajectories over extended periods of people's lives. Advanced quantitative methods are applied to leverage the untapped potential of these data. WEALTHTRAJECT lays the foundations for a new understanding of wealth inequality to inform relevant social policies.",
