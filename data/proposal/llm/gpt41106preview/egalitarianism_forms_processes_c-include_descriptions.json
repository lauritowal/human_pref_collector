        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: Heterogeneity of Egalitarian Structures, Processes, and Values: A Comparative Global Study**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a dual-faceted research initiative aimed at exploring the rich tapestry of egalitarian structures and processes, shedding light on how cultural values influence their effectiveness and limitations. The project is anchored in two methodological approaches: a comprehensive, library-based global comparative study, and a series of field ethnographic studies in various locations experiencing moments of egalitarian and inegalitarian tension, both within Europe and beyond. These two approaches are designed to be synergistic, with findings from each sphere informing the other, fostering a dynamic research process that adapts and evolves with each new insight.\n\nCentral to this investigation is the recognition of egalitarianism not as a monolithic ideal but as a spectrum of practices and beliefs shaped by diverse socio-cultural dimensions. By decentering traditional Euro-American perspectives, the project emphasizes the importance of understanding egalitarian practices as culturally-specific phenomena, with the potential to reveal the intricate ways in which these practices manifest, clash, and coexist in different societal contexts.\n\nThe proposed research will critically engage with the dualistic tensions often perceived in egalitarian discourse, positing these tensions as cultural constructs that may vary significantly across cultures. A novel comparative methodology will be developed to accommodate the heterogeneity inherent in egalitarian phenomena, ensuring sensitivity to the multitude of conceptions and historical, socio-political, and ecological conditions that give rise to egalitarianism.\n\nMoreover, this project will interrogate core issues such as the role of the state, religious influences, economic distribution strategies, and the impact of scale on egalitarian outcomes. By juxtaposing diverse egalitarian models, the research aims to contribute substantial insights into the constraints, potentials, and nuanced realities of egalitarian aspirations globally. This grant will thus support a pioneering step towards a more nuanced and culturally-contextualized understanding of equality, with implications for policy, theory, and practice."

This heterogeneity is approached through a) a library-based global comparative study and through b) field ethnographic studies, also comparatively oriented, in sites of egalitarian/inegalitarian crisis within Europe and elsewhere. The library and field studies are to be closely integrated, each influencing the development and directions of the other. The decentering inherent in the orientation heterogeneity involves an emphasis on the forms and practices of egalitarianism as cultural phenomena emergent within and having their complexities of effect through the socio-cultural dimensions of their realities. The key proposition of the project is that it is egalitarian practices and processes as cultural values that is of considerable importance for understanding their force, contradictions, limitations. Thus in this approach dualism that is widely conceived as being politically and philosophically problematic in egalitarianism as a whole is approached as a cultural phenomenon potentially specific to Euro-American forms. The emphasis on the heterogeneity of egalitarianism combined with the development of a comparative method appropriate to the heterogeneity of egalitarian processes, constitutes the distinction and the several contributions of the project to a fuller understanding of egalitarian processes, their constraints, limitations and potential. The method to be developed is to be open both to the varieties in the conceptions and imagination of egalitarian processes and the various historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances under which egalitarian practices emerge. Through the comparison perennial questions – the role of the state, religion, forms of economic distribution, the matter of scale – concerning forms and structures with egalitarian effect will be exposed to further consideration.",
