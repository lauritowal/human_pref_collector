        "Abstract:\n\nThe POLEMIC project seeks to explore the dynamic interplay between political emotional appeals and their influence on citizen decision-making. With the rising prominence of figures such as Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, and Marine Le Pen, who harness emotive language to galvanize support, this research aims to examine whether politicians are indeed employing more emotional rhetoric than in the past, and if so, to what end. Central to this investigation is the role of citizens' pre-existing emotional ties to political entities and how these affiliations may bolster or diminish the effectiveness of such appeals.\n\nAddressing a gap in historical data, POLEMIC will provide a comprehensive dataset of emotional appeals from political speeches spanning 1945 to the present across nine countries. This project will rigorously test three competing theories to elucidate the motivations behind politicians' emotional rhetoric: strategic vote-seeking, personality-driven behavior, or trend-based imitation.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, POLEMIC will implement cutting-edge methodologies, including automated text analysis for extracting emotional content from political speeches and physiological measurements to quantify emotional reactions. By integrating a macro perspective on politicians' communicative strategies with a micro-analysis of individual emotional responses, POLEMIC will forge a novel link between the fields of party politics and political psychology.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of POLEMIC are set to provide transformative insights into the strategic use of emotion in politics and the extent to which citizens' choices are swayed by such appeals versus rational deliberation. This research will not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of political communication but also inform the broader discourse on the rationality underpinning both the conveyance and reception of emotional appeals in the political arena."

With highly emotive language people like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen are pounding on the portals to power. Do such emotional appeals affect citizens’ political choices? Yes, they can. But, citizens’ existing emotional attachments to parties, leaders or issues moderate the success of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theory and use novel methods to explain when (types of) emotional appeals are persuasive, and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. Do politicians actually make more emotional appeals than in the past? And if so why are they doing it? We lack historical data of emotional appeals so we cannot answer these questions. POLEMIC will provide unique, historical data (1945-now, 9 countries) of emotional appeals by politicians in their speeches. I develop and test 3 alternative theories from different intellectual traditions that explain why politicians make emotional appeals: is it either (1) a vote-maximizing strategy, (2) a product of the personality of a politician or (3) just fashionable? POLEMIC analyses emotional appeals of politicians and the emotional responses of citizens to these appeals. Emotional appeals are texts, and emotions are experiences by the brain. To measure them POLEMIC will use innovative methods in political science: automated text analysis to extract emotion from appeals; physiological measurement to measure emotions. POLEMIC offers a ground-breaking combination of a macro-perspective (what politicians say) and a micro-perspective (how citizens respond) and forms a bridge between party politics and political psychology. The project’s output will indicate the importance of emotion in the decision-making of citizens, and the level of rationality that is behind politicians’ decision to make emotional appeals.",
