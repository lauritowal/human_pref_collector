        "Abstract:\n\nUnderstanding the evolutionary history of human adaptability to diverse environments is crucial to comprehending our species' past and future. This project aims to explore the evolutionary trajectory of hominin adaptability and dispersal patterns, particularly focusing on the role of environmental changes in shaping the distribution of Plio-Pleistocene hominins in higher latitudes of South Africa (SA) since ~3.7 million years ago (Ma). We hypothesize that the adaptive and migratory behaviors of early hominins were influenced by climatic oscillations, geographic barriers, and hydrographic changes throughout the Plio-Pleistocene period.\n\nTo address these questions, our interdisciplinary approach includes four components: (1) investigating geomorphological and palaeoecological shifts in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, (2) constructing dynamic palaeo-precipitation and vegetation models from diverse archives, (3) performing comprehensive anatomical and morphometric analyses of hominin fossils, and (4) integrating these datasets to evaluate hominin species diversity, gene flow, and dispersal patterns within a palaeobiogeographical framework.\n\nThree key hypotheses drive our research: First, that East African (EA) hominin ranges expanded and contracted in response to climatic fluctuations, occasionally causing southernmost populations to become isolated. Second, that the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and drainage reconfigurations in the Kalahari basin alternately severed and opened dispersal routes, leading to episodic hybridization between EA and SA hominins. Lastly, that post-1.5 Ma tectonic and hydrographic shifts, particularly the emergence of the Zambezi River as a significant barrier, fostered endemism and niche differentiation among SA hominins.\n\nThis study promises to provide vital insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped human adaptability and migration, offering a significant contribution to our understanding of human prehistory."

This trait facilitated their dispersal out-of-Africa to higher latitudes, i.e. to temperate and seasonal habitats, during the Pleistocene. However, there are Plio-Pleistocene hominins at higher latitudes in South Africa (SA) from ~3.7Ma onwards. Did human behavioural/physiological flexibility evolve early in our evolutionary history? Alternatively, did Pliocene hominins occupy such temperate zones due to different palaeoclimatic conditions in deep time and/or due to stochastic events? To untangle these questions this project will: (1) determine the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes in the Kalahari/proto-Limpopo basin, (2) create dynamic palaeo-precipitation/-vegetation models from various archives, (3) carry out detailed anatomical, functional and morphometric analyses of the hominin fossil record and (4) combine the datasets to appraise species diversity (functional adaptations), geneflow (hybridization) and dispersal scenarios (palaeobiogeography). 3 key working hypotheses underlie the proposal: 1. >2.6Ma East African (EA) hominin ranges expanded/contracted in accord with wet and dry phases; periodically, the southernmost populations became reproductively isolated. Early SA hominins represent descendants of Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, respectively. 2. ~2.6-1.5Ma With the onset of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the re-organisation of the drainage pattern within the Kalahari basin, dispersal corridors repeatedly closed (vicariance) and opened, resulting in intermittent levels of gene flow (i.e. hybridization) between EA and SA hominins. 3. <~1.5Ma Tectonic and hydrographic changes led to the Zambezi River becoming a powerful barrier during the Pleistocene. SA hominins younger than 1.5Ma are likely the result of endemism; competitive exclusion amongst these hominins resulted in exploitation of distinct ecological niche",
