        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe landscape of labor markets worldwide is undergoing a significant transformation, influenced by the forces of globalization and technological innovation. Such changes have given rise to a range of alternative work arrangements, such as outsourcing and flexible scheduling, which are reshaping the nature of employment and the distribution of economic resources. The LABFLEX project aims to delve into the intricate dynamics of labor market flexibility to understand its underlying causes and the resulting socio-economic implications, particularly in relation to wage inequality and gender wage disparities.\n\nAt the heart of this investigation are critical questions concerning the factors that drive variability in job contracts: Are these changes driven by worker preferences or by technological advancements that optimize the organization of work tasks? How does labor market flexibility influence wage structures and the gender wage gap? Furthermore, LABFLEX will explore whether flexible job contracts are compensating workers for potential risks and unfavorable conditions, or whether they represent a shift in the distribution of profits between employees and employers. The influence of labor market institutions and the effectiveness of policies in shaping these outcomes are also central themes of the study.\n\nTo address these inquiries, LABFLEX proposes a novel approach that integrates comprehensive register data with extensive experimental evidence regarding workers' preferences for diverse employment and remuneration arrangements, alongside a detailed corpus of job vacancy descriptions. This unique combination of data sources will offer an unprecedented view of both the supply and demand aspects of the labor market, enabling a thorough examination of job contract flexibility. Through the application of both experimental and advanced structural methods, the project seeks to generate groundbreaking insights into the factors that contribute to labor market flexibility and its far-reaching effects on society."

At the core of these major developments is the degree of flexibility in the labor market. Alternative work arrangements, e.g., outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs have become a common feature of labor markets across the globe. While most economists would argue that labor market flexibility facilitates reaping the benefits of globalization and technology growth, these developments can have far reaching consequences for the division of resources in society. Indeed, the recent decades have witnessed a sharp rise in wage inequality. LABFLEX is motivated by these developments and seeks to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. LABFLEX raises a series of questions: Do differences in job contracts reflect shifts in worker preferences, or do they mirror advances in technology that facilitate gains from organizing job tasks differently? What are the impacts of flexibility in job contracts on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers being compensated for the adverse work conditions or the higher income risks, or do changes in job contracts reflect changes in the sharing of rents between workers and firms? How do labor market institutions affect flexibility? And what is the role of labor market policies? To answer these questions, LABFLEX will for the first-time link register data to large-scale experimental evidence on workersâ€™ stated preferences for a wide array of work and pay arrangements, and an exhaustive full-text corpus of vacancies with information on job attributes. This will allow drawing a very detailed picture of both the supply and the demand side of the labor market, facilitating a study of flexibility in job contracts. Combining these data with experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility.",
