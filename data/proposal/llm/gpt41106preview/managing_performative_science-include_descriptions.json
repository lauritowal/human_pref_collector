        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe evolving dynamics between science and society have given rise to a phenomenon where scientific models do not merely serve to predict or explain, but actively shape the social realities they describe. This process, known as \"performativity,\" poses significant challenges and opportunities for policy-making and individual behavior. The proposed project, titled \"Management and Assessment of Performativity in Science\" (MAPS), aims to address the crucial gap in philosophical understanding of performativity's implications on scientific accuracy and ethical integrity. \n\nSpecifically, MAPS will examine the consequences when scientific models, such as those in economics, epidemiology, and machine learning, alter the very outcomes they forecast, as observed in scenarios like the public's response to COVID-19 predictions. This phenomenon questions the validity of predictions and the methodological approaches scientists should adopt in light of performative feedback. Additionally, MAPS will confront the ethical quandaries presented by the influential role of science in dictating human action and policy direction. The ethical assessment will focus on whether the performative aspect of science constitutes a form of manipulation that could potentially erode the tenets of democratic decision-making.\n\nThe project's threefold objectives are: (1) to conceptualize performativity by examining scientific practices, (2) to scrutinize the balance between science's epistemic functions and its performative influence, appraising the ethical risks involved, and (3) to provide philosophical and practical guidance on evaluating and steering performative science. Integrating empirical observations with rigorous philosophical analysis, MAPS aspires to pioneer the discourse on performativity management, situating it as a pivotal concern in the philosophy of science. This initiative will not only enrich philosophical scholarship but also offer a navigational tool for practitioners engaged in the interplay between scientific inquiry and societal impact."

Especially in the social realm, they can also influence their targets – a capacity that is called “performativity”. By influencing policy making and individual behavior, models from economics, epidemiology, or machine learning increasingly perform the social world in significant ways. This development should be of utmost importance to philosophers, for two reasons: First, performativity can impair scientific prediction and explanation. If, for instance, a model of the spread of COVID-19 predicts many deaths, people might reduce their social contacts in response, which may in turn lead to the predicted events not coming about! How should we evaluate such a prediction, and how should scientists deal with these effects? Second, the development raises difficult ethical questions about the legitimacy of science guiding human affairs, and the values that are implicit in this process. Should we welcome science’s increasingly practical role in shaping policy-making and individual behavior? Or should we regard such influence as manipulative, potentially undermining democratic decision making? These are difficult philosophical questions, but they also have significant practical import. Yet the philosophy of science hasn’t so far provided guidance on how performative science might be evaluated and managed. MAPS will close this lacuna. The core aims of the project are: (1) to develop a novel understanding of what performativity is and can do, by closely following scientific practice; (2) to understand the intricate relationship between science’s epistemic and performative roles, and to assess the ethical risks of performativity; and (3) to provide orientation to philosophers and practitioners for how to assess and manage performative science. By integrating insights from scientific practice with philosophical assessment, the project will establish performativity management as a central theme of philosophical inquiry.",
