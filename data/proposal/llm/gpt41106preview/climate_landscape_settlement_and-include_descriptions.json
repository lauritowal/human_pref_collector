        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the Climate and Long-term Settlement Shifts (CLaSS) project, a pioneering archaeological research initiative aiming to investigate the intricate dynamics between climate fluctuations and the evolution of human societies in the Fertile Crescent over a span of 6000 years (8000BP to 2000BP). Acknowledging the pivotal role of environmental factors in pre-industrial societies, particularly in relation to food production and security, this project seeks to understand the impact of climatic changes on the rise and fall of cities, states, and empires in this cradle of civilization.\n\nExisting research in this domain has been either narrowly focused on local contexts or too broad, covering vast geographical scopes without sufficient detail. The CLaSS project proposes a novel, hybrid methodological approach that leverages archaeological data science to amalgamate extensive empirical datasets at an unprecedented scale. By integrating archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical evidence across the entire Fertile Crescent with high-resolution climate simulations generated from General Circulation Models, the project aims to construct comprehensive datasets that are the largest of their kind to date, encompassing an area of 600,000km².\n\nThe rich datasets will facilitate a comparative analysis of population densities, settlement patterns, subsistence strategies, and landscape management, providing insights into the factors that have contributed to the resilience or decline of societies amidst variable climatic and environmental conditions. The project's innovative use of 'big data' in archaeology will offer a unique deep-time perspective, enabling a profound understanding of the sustainability and adaptive capacities of ancient societies in response to both abrupt and long-term climatic shifts. The outcomes of the CLaSS project are expected to significantly advance the field of archaeology and contribute valuable knowledge to contemporary discussions on environmental sustainability and climate adaptation."

Climate fluctuations are generally considered to be a significant factor in these changes because in pre-industrial societies they directly relate to food production and security. In the short term, ‘collapse’ events brought about by extreme weather changes such as droughts have been blamed for declines in population, social complexity and political systems. More broadly, the relationships between environment, settlement and surplus drive most models for the development of urbanism and hierarchical political systems. Studies seeking to correlate social and climatic changes in the past tend either to focus on highly localised analyses of specific sites and surveys or to take a more synthetic overview at much larger, even continental, scales. The CLaSS project will take a ground breaking hybrid approach using archaeological data science (or ‘big data’) to construct detailed, empirical datasets at unprecedented scales. Archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data (plant and tree remains) will be collated for the entire Fertile Crescent and combined with climate simulations derived from General Circulation Models using cutting edge techniques. The resulting datasets will represent the largest of their kind ever compiled, covering the period between 8000BP and 2000BP and an area of 600,000km2. Collecting data at this scale will enable us to compare population densities and distribution, subsistence practices and landscape management strategies to investigate the question: What factors have allowed for the differential persistence of societies in the face of changing climatic and environmental conditions? This ambitious project will provide insights into the sustainability and resilience of societies through both abrupt and longer term climate changes, leveraging the deep time perspective only available to archaeology.",
