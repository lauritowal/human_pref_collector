    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the significant shift in predictive methodologies within the social sciences, fueled by the rise of Big Data and Machine Learning. Traditional management of future uncertainties through probabilistic approaches is increasingly being supplanted by algorithmic prediction models that offer individualized forecasts. While such precision in forecasting has apparent benefits, it also disrupts the foundational concept of shared uncertainty that has underpinned societal institutions since modernity. The absence of this shared uncertainty poses unexplored risks and challenges to the fabric of society.\n\nThe proposed research seeks to systematically investigate the effects of this paradigm shift from probabilistic to algorithmic predictions. A series of theory-driven empirical studies will examine the transition within three critical social domains, each representing a fundamental aspect of the algorithmic prediction challenge. The study of personalized insurance will explore the individualization of prediction and its potential impact on the principle of mutualization central to actuarial practices. The investigation into precision medicine will consider the tension between algorithmic specificity and established statistical generalization methods. Lastly, predictive policing will provide a canvas to assess issues of bias and the blurring lines between prevention and repression.\n\nThis project aims to develop a nuanced understanding of the technical, social, and theoretical implications of algorithmic predictions. By examining the transformation in these domains, the research will offer insights into how digital forecasting is reshaping society's approach to managing the future. The outcomes will contribute to a comprehensive framework for assessing the consequences of predictive technologies in a digital society and provide guidance for policy-making, ethical considerations, and future sociotechnical research endeavors."

Recent advances in digital forecasting claim to provide a predictive score for individual persons or singular events, thereby introducing a new way to manage the uncertainty of the future. But knowing the future in advance is not only advantageous. In fact, for our society, uncertainty about the future is also a resource. Since modernity, with the support of probability calculus various social institutions in different domains have developed means of coping with ignorance of the future by starting with the one thing that we all share – uncertainty. What happens to the stabilized forms of management of the future when their first resource – shared uncertainty – is missing? There is still no systematic research on this groundbreaking transformation. This project proposes a set of theory-driven empirical studies of the transition from probabilistic forms of uncertainty management to the new algorithmic forms of prediction. We will investigate three important social areas highlighting three fundamental dimensions with which digital forecast must deal. 1) First we will focus on personalized insurance. Here the key dimension is individualization of prediction, where the challenge is that such prediction could undermine the mutualization principle organized around actuarial practices. 2) Our second research area is precision medicine, highlighting the dimension of generalization where the challenge is the combination of algorithmic procedures with established statistical methods. 3) In the third field, predictive policing underscores the problem of bias while it challenges the distinction between prevention and repression. Exploring these transformation and its consequences, the project aims at developing a comprehensive approach to study the social, technical and theoretical aspects of prediction in digital society",
