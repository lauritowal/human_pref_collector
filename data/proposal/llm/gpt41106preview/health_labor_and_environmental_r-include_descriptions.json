        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a visionary project aimed at enhancing environmental policy-making in Europe, tackling the pressing issues of global climate change and regional air pollution. Recognizing the intricate balance between environmental regulation and economic impact, the project proposes an innovative suite of tools to assess the trade-off between the cost of curbing fossil fuel combustion and the associated benefits to human health. By integrating empirical models with unprecedented spatial detail, this research will advance economic impact analysis significantly.\n\nThe project's interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap between pollution emissions and their spatial dispersion, utilizing chemical transport models to track air pollutants. Moreover, it seeks to quantify the subclinical and long-term health effects of air pollution, thereby refining economic damage estimates. The research is divided into two parts: the first examines the economic outcomes of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme's impact on local air quality; the second assesses the influence of air pollution on labor supply, health outcomes, and migration patterns within a unified empirical framework.\n\nWith a focus on providing empirical evidence to inform environmental policy in the context of climate and air quality management, this project stands to make a significant contribution to global environmental governance. Addressing challenges that affect some of Europeâ€™s wealthiest regions, the project is poised to present cost-effective solutions for further reducing air pollution, while also considering the broader implications for human wellbeing and economic stability. The anticipated outcome is a set of actionable insights for policy-makers, ensuring that environmental initiatives are grounded in rigorous, data-driven analysis."

Notwithstanding such improvements, environmental regulation continues to be a top priority for policy makers in Europe and other post-industrial societies. Global climate change is an important reason for this. Increasing demand for environmental quality is another one, explaining why some of the richest agglomerations in Europe have been adopting very costly measures to further reduce air pollution. Both global climate change and regional air pollution originate to a large extent from the combustion of fossil fuels, an activity that, in Europe, is costly to curb but also causes substantial damage to human health. This project contributes new tools for assessing this trade-off by (i) developing empirical models that greatly enhance spatial detail in state-of-the-art economic impact analysis, (ii) pioneering an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions at the source to chemical transport models for air pollutants, and (iii) incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts of air pollution into economic damage estimates. Part I of the project studies the economic implications of changes in local air quality that were an unintended consequence of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide. Part II analyzes the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration in a unified empirical framework. The key objective of this project is to provide empirical evidence that can inform environmental policy-making in the broad contexts of climate policy and air quality management. Given the ambitious concepts proposed, the global significance of the environmental problems addressed, and the focus on policy, this project has the potential to make a large impact.",
