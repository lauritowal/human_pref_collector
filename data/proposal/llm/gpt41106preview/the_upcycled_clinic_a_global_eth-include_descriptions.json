    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the inefficiencies and waste generated in the healthcare sector, especially within hospitals, have become increasingly evident. The Upcycled Clinic project offers a unique ethnographic exploration into the potential for creative repurposing of materials in clinical settings, diverging from the prevalent focus on technological solutions and the circular economy. This research initiative aims to uncover and understand the often-overlooked practices of improvisation and resourcefulness in hospitals, seeking to illuminate the conditions that foster or hinder such creative engagement with materials.\n\nComposed of five sub-projects, the study will span several geographies, including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S, and the U.K, to provide a global perspective on the subject. Ethnographers will engage with a diverse group of hospital staff members, including those in ancillary roles like cleaning and laundry, to gain a comprehensive view of the material practices within the clinical environment. Additionally, the project will analyze open datasets that document pandemic-related improvisations, further enriching the research's empirical foundation.\n\nThe Upcycled Clinic is poised to make significant scholarly contributions by shifting the focus of hospital ethnographies to materiality, presenting the first global analysis of clinical improvisation, and pioneering new methodological approaches in the social sciences that minimize data waste. By integrating sensory methods and advocating for the reuse and sharing of research materials, the study seeks to redefine the paradigms of ethnographic inquiry.\n\nUltimately, the insights gleaned from this research will not only enrich the academic discourse on materiality and innovation in the workplace but also offer practical strategies for enhancing resilience in healthcare. By identifying and promoting conditions that enable the creative use of existing resources, the Upcycled Clinic project aims to guide healthcare institutions towards more sustainable and locally-tailored solutions to issues of waste and resource scarcity."

Hospitals in particular have become nodes of disposability. Solutions to this problem has to date attracted mostly the attention of medical technology companies promoting circular economies, a model still reliant on production and technological innovation. The Upcycled Clinic takes a different direction. This ethnographic project focuses on creative practices such as repurposing in the clinic, involving making the most of existing materials. Five sub-projects have been carefully selected with illuminating examples around the world including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S and U.K. A team of ethnographers will conduct fieldwork and interviews with a range of actors, many often overlooked, such as cleaners and laundry staff, and look at open datasets of pandemic improvisations. The overarching objective is, through comparison, to better understand conditions which cultivate and curtail creative material engagement in the clinic. This inventive and timely contribution to the social study of medicine will advance the field in at least three directions. First, by attending more closely to materials, it moves hospital ethnographies beyond current focus on the patient encounter. Second, it will offer the first globally orientated study of improvisation in the clinic. Third, it breaks new methodological ground in the social sciences by developing novel ways of reusing and sharing research material in ethnography that adopts sensory methods and rethinks data waste. These contributions from the rich case of the clinic will add empirical insights to theories of materiality and help address long standing questions regarding resilience and innovation in the workplace. Practically, the study will articulate conditions under which healthcare can leverage creativity and pay better attention to local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.",
