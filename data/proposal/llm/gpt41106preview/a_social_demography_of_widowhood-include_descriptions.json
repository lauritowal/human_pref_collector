        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project aims to comprehensively examine the increasing phenomenon of widowhood in aging societies, a critical issue that has been largely overlooked in social demography. The significance of widowhood is underscored by the simultaneous increase in its occurrence and the reduction of survival benefits in many countries, leaving bereaved spouses vulnerable to significant mental health and economic challenges. This pioneering study seeks to advance the understanding of widowhood by implementing an innovative conceptual and methodological framework that considers both the risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood events.\n\nThe risk component of the study evaluates the probability and duration of widowhood, while the vulnerability aspect assesses the mental health and economic impacts of widowhood, with a particular emphasis on the process of expected widowhood which is common but underexplored. This approach challenges the current literature that primarily focuses on the immediate aftermath of bereavement, especially in cases of unexpected deaths, and fails to consider the broader, long-term effects of anticipated widowhood.\n\nThe project is structured around four groundbreaking pillars: (1) the assessment of risk and vulnerability, (2) the analysis of social inequalities influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age, (3) the exploration of country differences, and (4) the investigation of changes over time. By harmonizing high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data from up to 60 countries with diverse demographic trends and welfare systems ranging from 1985 to 2050, the project will deploy advanced statistical methods to yield systematic and comprehensive estimates.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will fill the existing knowledge gap in the social demography of widowhood, offer valuable insights into the challenges faced by the growing widow population and their families, and contribute to the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems."

Although the frequency of this high risk event is increasing across ageing societies, many countries have cut survival benefits exposing more bereaved spouses to dire short- and long-term consequences. Despite its growing relevance, widowhood research remains underdeveloped compared to other disruptive events, such as divorce. This ground-breaking research moves beyond the state-of-the-art in at least four ways to establish a social demography of widowhood. (1) The foundation of my project lies in an innovative conceptual and methodological approach to the risk and vulnerability to widowhood. While risk aims at the probability and duration of widowhood, vulnerability focuses on its mental health and economic consequences. Current assessments of widowhood effects are limited to change in wellbeing directly after bereavement with a special focus on unexpected deaths. However, the most prevalent scenario entails a process of terminal health decline in the years before death. The consequences of the often neglected longer process of expected widowhood may be larger than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood. Three ground-breaking pillars build on risk and vulnerability to examine (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity and nativity, social support networks, gender and age, as well as (3) country differences and (4) change over time. High-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources will be harmonized and applied to an advanced set of statistical methods for up to 60 ageing countries varying in demographic trends and welfare systems from 1985 with projections to 2050. A social demography of widowhood will supplement fragmented evidence with systematic and comprehensive estimates on risk and vulnerability, provide insights into the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems.",
