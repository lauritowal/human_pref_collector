        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to develop OsciLang, an innovative wearable brain-computer-interface neurofeedback system designed to assist in the detection and remediation of language disorders, including dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). Leveraging recent discoveries in the field of neural oscillations during speech processing, this system targets the enhancement of brain-speech synchronization, which is crucial for effective language function. Our preliminary research has identified a key deficit in auditory tracking within the delta frequency band in individuals with dyslexia, indicating a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention.\n\nOsciLang is envisioned as a user-friendly, cost-effective tool that will offer two-fold benefits: diagnosis and measurement of an individual's ability to align their neural activity with speech patterns, and the provision of neurofeedback to improve this synchronization. The system will employ real-time EEG data to allow users to monitor and adapt their brain activity, fostering improved literacy skills, particularly in challenging auditory environments.\n\nThe core innovation of OsciLang lies in its algorithm, which focuses on phase coherence at theta and delta bands—a strategy not yet seen in existing neurofeedback technologies. By enabling individuals to modulate specific neural oscillatory patterns, OsciLang promises to make significant strides in the field of language therapy and literacy acquisition. The project is poised to set the stage for a broader application of this technology, potentially revolutionizing the way we approach learning and reading enhancement across various populations. Through the implementation of OsciLang, we aim to validate a generalizable framework for neurofeedback applications that can be extended to diverse learning contexts."

To date there is no established neurofeedback protocols for treating language or reading impairments. In essence, this tool will (a) diagnose/measure and (b) improve/rehabilitate an individual’s ability to synchronize their brain’s activity with changes in a speech signal. This novel type of neurofeedback, based on phase coherence of the neural oscillatory activity with speech, will allow us to detect and enhance language function. It capitalizes on our recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, where we found reduced auditory tracking in delta band in dyslexic readers compared with controls, advocating impaired auditory processing in dyslexia. Thus, our work and related findings suggest that literacy skills in dyslexics will improve by means of neurofeedback training protocols that enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, especially in noisy environments. OsciLang will help to sustainably enhance brain-speech synchronization strength by allowing participants to shape their neural activity while tracking speech. This will be accomplished by presenting participants with a simple and friendly interface that quantifies basic parameters of their brain activity in real time, measured via EEG. This information can then be used by participants to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Based on our prior findings, OsciLang’ algorithms will be monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, an innovative approach that has yet to be implemented in a neurofeedback system. Oscilang will also lay the foundations for extending this novel approach to provide a general framework and technology for enhancing any individual’s ability to learn to read.",
