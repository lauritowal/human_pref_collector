        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of an innovative, portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device to detect early signs of social predisposition impairments in newborns, which are often associated with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). Building on preliminary findings from an ERC-funded study, we propose to create a wireless, user-friendly EEG system that can rapidly and automatically assess face processing abilities in infants. The study leveraged a novel oscillatory visual presentation of face-like stimuli, which elicited a reliable EEG-based index of face processing observable within two minutes of a newborn's attention. However, the current EEG technology is limited to laboratory settings due to its lack of portability and the need for specialized equipment.\n\nThe proposed device will revolutionize the field by allowing EEG recordings to be performed outside of laboratory environments, including in-home settings. It will integrate dry electrodes for ease of use and an automatic algorithm to extract the EEG index in real time. This groundbreaking tool aims to establish an early, objective biomarker for ASD risk in newborns, potentially enabling widespread screening and timely interventions. Additionally, the versatility of the visual stimulation paradigm holds promise for further research into the neural underpinnings of various perceptual and cognitive functions in infants. The successful development of this EEG-based device could lead to significant advancements in the early detection of ASD and contribute to our understanding of infant cognitive development."

An early detector of social predispositions and their impairment in newborns might provide a valuable biomarker for ASD, an indicator of utmost relevance since infants with ASD greatly benefit from early behavioral intervention. This proposal builds on a study performed within my ERC grant in which, by designing an innovative oscillatory visual presentation of face-like patterns and perceptually equivalent controls, we identified an EEG-based index of face processing, present in each newborn tested and obtainable with less than 2 minutes of newborn’s visual attention. However, recording newborn’s EEG is currently possible only in laboratory settings, as no fully portable EEG system adapted for newborns exists in the market. The goal of this proposal is to design a portable, wireless EEG-based device that allows easy, rapid and automatic testing of face processing in newborns in any context, including their homes. This device is ground-breaking because it will combine the efficacy of our innovative experimental paradigm tailored to newborn’s restricted visual attention with a portable, low-power, wireless EEG device based on dry electrodes and an automatic algorithm that will extract on-line the EEG-based index of face processing. Its realization will enable the development of an early, objective and easy-to-test EEG-based biomarker on newborns at risk, potentially opening the way to large-scale screening protocols. Given the flexibility of the paradigm with respect to the content of the visual stimulation, this method might be used for research purposes to explore the neural bases of other perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns.",
