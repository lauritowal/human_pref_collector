        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the LOSS project, an interdisciplinary investigation into the relationship between economic hardship and the rise in support for socially conservative political agendas that target marginalized groups. Recent trends in various European countries have shown a troubling correlation between financial crises and the increased popularity of far-right parties. The primary objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms by which economic distress may foster narratives of loss, thereby fueling backing for policies that jeopardize the rights of ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities, migrants, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and women. These patterns pose significant risks to the social fabric of national and local communities across Europe.\n\nTo address this complex issue, the LOSS project will construct an innovative theoretical framework, synthesizing perspectives from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics. This framework will be instrumental in understanding how perceived economic loss shapes support for conservative political movements. Employing a multi-method empirical strategy, the project will integrate both qualitative and quantitative research methods to provide a robust analysis of the proposed narratives of loss.\n\nFurthermore, the project will conduct comparative analyses across five European nations—France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—each chosen for its varying degree of economic hardship compensation. By examining these diverse national and local contexts, the LOSS project aims to assess the impact of policy environments on the interplay between economic challenges and political attitudes, offering key insights for policymakers, scholars, and civil society actors engaged in fostering inclusive, cohesive communities in the face of economic adversity."

Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",
