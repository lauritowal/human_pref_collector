        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the evolution of musical performance from a textual to a performative paradigm, reflecting the larger societal transition to a mediatized culture centered on images and sounds. The research will examine the historical context of traditional musical interpretation, the emergence of experimental performance practices, and the applicability of the scientific experimentation model to music performance. Central to this inquiry is the hands-on artistic practice, which will be employed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the research team to produce tangible artistic outcomes, thereby advancing both theoretical and practical knowledge within the field.\n\nThe objectives of this project are threefold: to assess the historical specificity of traditional conceptions of musical interpretation; to forge new research trajectories through the active engagement in experimental performances; and to evaluate the potential of scientific experimentation models in enhancing our understanding of musical performance as a dynamic event. By utilizing music as a methodological tool, this research aims to offer significant contributions to the innovation of performance theory and practice, positioning itself at the forefront of Artistic Research—a field that is rapidly gaining prominence.\n\nThe project promises to provide palpable examples of alternative performance approaches, challenging and potentially reshaping the conventional notions of musical 'interpretation'. It will integrate theoretical exploration with practical musical application, presenting a discernible shift in the performance paradigm that can be critically examined and experienced aurally. Situated within the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, the project will not only benefit from the institution's existing focus on Artistic Experimentation but also enrich the ongoing discourse with its findings, thereby advancing the field's understanding of the performative nature of music in the contemporary mediatized context."

The aim of this research proposal is to investigate: (a) the extent to which the traditional conception of musical interpretation is bound to a given historical period; (b) how new investigative paths can be created through experimental performance practices; and (c) the extent to which the scientific model of the practice of experimentation is transferable to music performance. Crucial to these objectives is the material engagement in artistic practice, including the generation of concrete artistic outputs by the PI and other team members. The practice of music – understood as a fundamental methodological tool for the generation and exposition of new knowledge, will contribute decisively to innovations in both theory and practice, opening up opportunities for both scholarship and future performance practices. While exploring alternative approaches to music performance, this project will deliver concrete examples of such possibilities, situating itself at the frontline of the burgeoning field of Artistic Research. Combining theoretical investigation with the concrete practice of music, this project presents a case for change in the field of musical performance. Alongside critical reflection on the state-of-the-art, it proposes a graspable and ‘audible’ alternative to traditional understandings of ‘interpretation’ in musical performance. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, it will benefit from, and contribute to, the wider discourse on Artistic Experimentation, the Centre's current research focus.",
