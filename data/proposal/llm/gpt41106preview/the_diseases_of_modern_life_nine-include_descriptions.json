        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes an interdisciplinary historical study to explore the perceived epidemic of stress and information overload in the Victorian era as a mirror to contemporary anxieties in the Information Age. Entitled \"Echoes of Modernity: Stress and Information Overload from Victorian Era to the Digital Age,\" the study aims to delve into the nineteenth-century discourse on mental and physical health problems attributed to the rapid changes and demands of modern life. Drawing inspiration from Benjamin Ward Richardson's \"Diseases of Modern Life\" (1876), the research will investigate various 'diseases' identified during that period, ranging from professional burnout to substance abuse and environmental pollution.\n\nBy examining literature, science, and medicine of the time, the project seeks to trace the flow of ideas related to health and societal pressures across these fields. It will revisit the integrative approach of Victorian thinkers who connected physiological, psychological, and social well-being. Specific focal points include financial and occupational-related illnesses, middle-class addiction patterns, health-inspired travel, educational stressors, as well as the development of phobias and nervous disorders. Furthermore, the research will analyze how utopian and dystopian visions in literature reflected and influenced perceptions of health and disease.\n\nThis study's multi-dimensional approach promises to pioneer new pathways in research by dissolving traditional barriers between psychiatric, environmental, and literary history. Ultimately, it aims to provide fresh insights into how historical contexts of stress and health concerns can inform our understanding of similar challenges in the current era, offering valuable perspectives on how to contextualize and address the problems of modernity in the twenty-first century. The project aspires to contribute significantly to the fields of history, literature, and health studies, while also engaging a broader public dialogue about the impact of modern life on mental and physical health."

The Victorians diagnosed similar problems in the nineteenth century. The medic James Crichton Browne spoke in 1860 of the ‘velocity of thought and action’ now required, and of the stresses imposed on the brain forced to process in a month more information ‘than was required of our grandfathers in the course of a lifetime’. This project will explore the phenomena of stress and overload, and other disorders associated in the nineteenth century with the problems of modernity, as expressed in the literature, science and medicine of the period, tracking the circulation of ideas across these diverse areas. Taking its framework from Diseases of Modern Life (1876) by the medical reformer, Benjamin Ward Richardson, it will explore ‘diseases from worry and mental strain’, as experienced in the professions, ‘lifestyle’ diseases such as the abuse of alcohol and narcotics, and also diseases from environmental pollution. This study will return to the holistic, integrative vision of the Victorians, as expressed in the science and in the great novels of the period, exploring the connections drawn between physiological, psychological and social health, or disease. Particular areas of focus will be: diseases of finance and speculation; diseases associated with particular professions; alcohol and drug addiction amidst the middle classes; travel for health; education and over-pressure in the classroom; the development of phobias and nervous disorders; and the imaginative construction of utopias and dystopias, in relation to health and disease. In its depth and range the project will take scholarship into radically new ground, breaking through the compartmentalization of psychiatric, environmental or literary history, and offering new ways of contextualising the problems of modernity facing us in the twenty-first century.",
