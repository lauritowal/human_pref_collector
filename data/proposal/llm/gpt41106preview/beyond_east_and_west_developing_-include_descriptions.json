        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious project aimed at bridging musical traditions from East and West, creating a new vein of contemporary concert music and opera that draws from Turkey's rich musical heritage. Recognizing the challenges posed by differences in tuning, texture, and performance practices, the project proposes a series of innovative research workshops to be conducted in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK. These workshops will focus on equipping traditional Turkish musicians and singers with the skills to perform new compositions, while also training Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques. \n\nThe project's objectives extend to developing methodologies for assessing the adaptive processes of musicians and the reception of such music by diverse audiences. Additionally, it will pioneer the creation of an ensemble interface with newly designed instruments to facilitate the fusion of Eastern and Western sounds. Groundbreaking research on timbre will provide further insights into sound production, complementing the project's overarching goal.\n\nA significant output of this research will be the publication of an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds and an e-book titled \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI)\" through Cambridge University Press. This publication will not only serve as a practical guide but also feature audio and visual examples accessible through a complementing online resource.\n\nThe project's transdisciplinary approach and its focus on the imaginative 'free play' as envisioned by Kant, hold the potential to serve as a metaphorical framework for addressing broader cultural challenges. By transcending cultural barriers through music, this project offers a compelling, innovative model for fostering cross-cultural understanding in our increasingly interconnected world."

But differences in tuning, texture, and between oral and notated orientations to performance have presented seemingly intractable obstacles. This project systematises practical processes essential for the creation of a new, East-West strand of contemporary music and opera. It initiates cutting-edge research workshops in Istanbul, Holland and the UK to: 1. Train top-level traditional instrumentalists and singers in Turkey effectively to perform a new repertoire; 2. Train top professional Western singers in non-Western techniques and nuances of vocal production; 3. Develop approaches for modelling such music's impacts on Turkish and Western musicians’ adaptive processes in rehearsal and performance, and diverse audiences’ perceptions of such music; 4. Create an ensemble interface (including newly designed instruments) to increase capacity for merging sounds beyond levels now achievable; 5. Produce groundbreaking studies on timbre to provide new insights into how sound is produced; 6. Establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems onto one another. This research, together with an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds will comprise the core of a published (CUP) team-authored e-book, Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), with included audio and visual examples linked as an online resource. Looking further, this project’s multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach also suggests a model for probing how the ‘free play’ of the imagination (Kant) possible within processes of art and its creation can provide metaphors towards understanding one of the most urgent and compelling issues of our time: how to transcend cultural barriers (real or imagined) that exist today.",
