        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support a groundbreaking investigation into Ireland's unique relationship with classical antiquity, a relationship distinguished by its depth despite the island's non-Roman history. The project hypothesizes that Ireland's engagement with ancient Greek and Roman models is of an exceptional nature, especially compared to other northern European nations. Through the examination of nine carefully chosen diachronic themes—language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence—the research aims to uncover the reasons behind Ireland's distinctive classical tradition, dating back to its earliest literature.\n\nThe proposed study will not only explore what makes Irish classical reception notable but will also act as a catalyst for interdisciplinary dialogue, intersecting fields such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, various literary traditions, medieval studies, postcolonial theory, philosophy, material culture, gender studies, and global studies. This multifaceted approach promises to offer new perspectives on Ireland's literary, social, and political narratives.\n\nAdditionally, the project is timely in that it aligns with contemporary reflections on Ireland's complex history, including the decade of centenary commemorations and the persistent tensions in Northern Ireland. By tracing the influence of classical cultures in shaping Ireland's discourse over centuries, the research will provide valuable insights into the island's past and present, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of its cultural and political landscape. This exploration of Ireland's classical engagement will not only fill a significant gap in scholarly knowledge but also resonate with broader discussions on national identity and cultural heritage."

Unlike Britain and mainland Europe, Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire. Yet the island has an extraordinarily vibrant tradition of classical learning that dates back to its earliest recorded literature, and is unparalleled in other northern European countries. Research for this project will address why this is the case, by examining sources through nine significant diachronic themes identified by the PI: language; land; travel and exile; Troy; satire; Neoplatonism; female voices; material culture; and global influence. This multi-thematic approach will enable analysis of what is remarkable about classical reception in Ireland. It will also provide a heuristic framework that generates dialogue between normally disparate fields, such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English-language literature, Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project will engage with contemporary preoccupations surrounding the politics and history of the divided island of Ireland, such as the current decade of centenary commemorations for the foundation of an independent Irish state (1912-1922, 2012-2022), and the on-going violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. These issues will serve as a springboard for opening new avenues of investigation that look far beyond the past 100 years, but are linked to them. The project will thus shed new light on the role of classical culture in shaping literary, social, and political discourse across the island of Ireland, and throughout its history.",
