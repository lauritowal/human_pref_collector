        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to enhance the theoretical understanding of decentralized trading in the presence of informational asymmetries and limited commitment, phenomena prevalent in many real-world markets. Current theory, while rich in insights, often rests on strong assumptions regarding the ability of parties to commit, rendering it less applicable to a broad range of trading scenarios. Moreover, traditional literature has primarily concentrated on single, non-repeated transactions, neglecting the complexity and dynamics introduced by repeated interactions over time.\n\nOur research aims to fill this critical gap by developing a comprehensive game-theoretic framework to analyze markets where trade is not only recurrent but also occurs under conditions of asymmetric information. In such markets, earlier transactions bear the potential to influence subsequent negotiations, a factor not adequately addressed by existing models. By focusing on the iterative nature of trade, particularly in the context of non-durable goods and divisible durable goods, we will explore how information divulged in initial exchanges affects future trades and market efficiency.\n\nThe proposed analysis will rigorously examine the performance and properties of various trading mechanisms commonly employed in decentralized markets, identifying the sources of inefficiencies and proposing modifications to enhance their effectiveness. The outcomes of this research are expected to have significant implications for the design and regulation of market institutions. By advancing a more nuanced understanding of repeated trade under informational asymmetries, this project will provide policymakers and market designers with the tools necessary to craft robust mechanisms that can mitigate inefficiencies and promote fairer, more efficient markets. Our investigation, therefore, promises to make a substantial contribution to the fields of economics and finance, with practical applications that extend to various sectors of the economy."

In most trading situations, some of the parties possess superior information about critical aspects of the environment. For example, in financial markets, professional investors are better informed about the quality of the assets that they sell to individuals. Similarly, consumers typically have private information about their willingness to pay for goods and services. It is well understood that informational asymmetries are responsible for one of the most serious forms of market inefficiency. Because of its strong assumptions in term of commitment, the standard theory of mechanism design is unsuitable for the study of many actual trading institutions. On the other hand, the focus of most of the existing literature on trading with limited commitment is the case in which the parties can trade at most once. While satisfactory in situations like the sale of a house, this assumption leaves out many important economic environments where the parties trade repeatedly over time. However, repeated transactions are natural both when the objects of trade are non-durable (e.g., services such as phone or internet plans) and when they are durable but divisible (e.g., financial assets). A crucial difference between these cases and those analyzed in the literature is the fact that the information revealed in early transactions may affect the outcome of future negotiations. We plan to provide a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. Our investigation will shed light on the properties of various commonly used trading mechanisms and will inform us about possible remedies to make them more efficient. This will contribute substantially to the design of adequate institutions and to the regulation of markets.",
