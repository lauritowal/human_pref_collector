        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe EQuaTe project is poised to revolutionize the field of archaeology through the development of a comprehensive chronology that will elucidate the timeline of early human evolution and migration across Europe. The Quaternary period, covering the last 2.6 million years, has seen dramatic climatic shifts and the consequent adaptation and movement of human populations. Despite a wealth of geological and archaeological data delineating these environmental shifts, constructing a precise timeline has remained a challenge, especially for events predating the 60,000-year limit of radiocarbon dating.\n\nEQuaTe seeks to overcome this obstacle by leveraging recent breakthroughs in amino acid and thermoluminescence (TL) dating techniques. The project will focus on calcitic fossils, such as snail opercula, which have proven to be both reliable amino acid repositories and sources of stable TL signals over extended Quaternary timescales. By applying these dating methods synergistically to biominerals, EQuaTe aims to construct a robust chronological framework, spanning the entirety of the Palaeolithic era in Eurasia.\n\nThis innovative paired-dating strategy will enable the project to address fundamental questions about the timing and conditions of human dispersal into Europe, the relationship between climatic changes and population dynamics, and the nature of technological variations in tool-making across different regions. The resulting chronology will extend from Britain to the Black Sea, providing an unparalleled understanding of cultural and evolutionary processes over the last 2.6 million years.\n\nEQuaTe's pan-European dating framework promises to be a landmark contribution to our comprehension of human history, offering definitive insights into the interplay of human development and environmental factors across vast temporal and geographic scales."

During the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years), Europe witnessed major climatic oscillations, with periodic expansion of ice sheets into lowland areas, changes of sea-level, re-organization of plant and animal communities, and the evolution and migration of human populations. Despite extensive studies of the rich European geological and archaeological records (providing a detailed history of these environmental changes), these have little meaning without a secure chronology. Dating is extremely difficult beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~60,000 years). Key to our approach is the discovery that commonly-occurring calcitic fossils (snail opercula) provide both closed-system repositories for amino acids and a stable TL signal over Quaternary timescales. It is therefore now possible to use both dating methods on the same biomineral to build a strong dating framework; taking advantage of momentum in this field, EQuATe will apply this approach on a European scale. This novel paired chronology, spanning the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia, will refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change over the last 2.6 Ma, across a region stretching from Britain to the Black Sea. EQuaTe will provide the scientific means to answer critical questions, e.g.: when did early human populations expand into Europe, and under what climatic conditions? Are apparent differences in tool technologies a reflection of different species, technical evolution over time, or geographical variations in source materials and cultural tradition? The pan-European chronology developed by this research will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand our past.",
