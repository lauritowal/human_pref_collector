        "**Abstract:**\n\nPublic sector procurement is a crucial activity that underpins the effective functioning of various societal sectors such as defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The design of procurement procedures is paramount to prevent waste, encourage contractor compliance, and enhance overall social welfare. This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research program aimed at deepening our understanding of the impact of corruption and reputation in public sector procurement processes.\n\nThe proposed research is structured into three empirical projects. The first project investigates the influence of a vendor rating system on contractor performance, procurement costs, and the potential for corruption, as well as its effect on the participation of new bidders. This analysis will provide insights into the effectiveness of reputation-based procurement strategies and their implications for policy design.\n\nThe second project delves into the existence of criminal networks within public procurement, evaluating the prevalence and scope of such corruption. It will critically assess the efficacy of different awarding rules in mitigating corrupt practices and propose analytical tests to detect such activities, thereby contributing to the development of more transparent procurement mechanisms.\n\nThe third project examines the procurement of medical devices in the European Union, offering a descriptive analysis of current practices. It will explore the use of discretionary awarding rules, investigating whether these rules are exploited for corrupt purposes or to acknowledge reputable contractors, and assess the resulting impact on patient welfare.\n\nOverall, the research seeks to inform and improve public procurement policies by providing empirical evidence on the roles of corruption and reputation, ultimately aiming to enhance accountability, cost-effectiveness, and social benefits derived from public sector procurement activities."

Thus, it is crucial that the procedures through which procurement occurs be designed to avoid waste and enhance social welfare. Preventing corruption and ensuring contractor compliance with their obligations constitute primary design goals. Nevertheless, very limited evidence exists as to how different awarding methods are susceptible to corruption, and how contractors’ past reputation should be used to award new tenders. This research proposal describes three empirical projects that will advance the frontier of our understanding of the roles of corruption and reputation in procurement. Component 1 focuses on the use of reputation in contract procurement. It analyzes the evidence produced by the introduction of a vendor rating system to: i) determine whether the new system induced contractors to improve their performance, ii) determine whether performance improvements caused higher procurement costs, and iii) evaluate concerns on corruption and entry of new bidders. Component 2 focuses on corruption in public procurement. It analyzes evidence on the presence of networks of firms engaged in criminal activities in public procurement to determine: i) the extent of the phenomenon, (ii) the functioning of different awarding rules against corruption, and iii) the use of tests to detect corruption. Component 3 focuses on healthcare procurement regulations. It analyzes evidence on the public procurement of medical devices to accomplish: i) a descriptive analysis of the procurement practices across the EU, ii) an assessment of whether discretionary awarding rules are used to foster corruption or to reward contractors with better reputation, and iii) an evaluation of these procurement practices in terms of patients’ welfare.",
