        "**Abstract:**\n\nUnderstanding linguistic diversity holds the key to unraveling complex sociohistorical narratives and cognitive processes underlying human communication. This project addresses this challenge by concentrating on the rich linguistic landscape of the Upper Amazon in western South America. Recognized as a crucible of linguistic variation, this region presents a stratified tapestry of language families and contact-induced linguistic features corresponding to different waves of human settlement and interaction.\n\nThe research aims to systematically dissect the intricate layers of linguistic diversity in the Upper Amazon to trace the sociohistorical forces that have shaped its current linguistic panorama. The northern and southern extremities of the region, characterized by their remarkable diversity, are posited as vestiges of ancient linguistic equilibria, while the central corridor, dominated by three language families, illustrates more recent expansions. Together, these areas provide an exceptional venue for investigating linguistic evolution.\n\nThe project's approach is distinctly multidisciplinary, integrating geographic, sociohistorical, and linguistic methodologies to reconstruct a multifaceted historical narrative. By comparing these reconstructed layers, the research will achieve an unprecedented level of disciplinary integration, creating a comprehensive model of the sociohistorical dynamics at play.\n\nInterrogating the congruences and discrepancies between the geographic spread of languages, sociohistorical accounts of human movement, and linguistic data enables a robust reconstruction of past events such as migrations, language shifts, and social exchanges. This, in turn, will illuminate the mechanisms by which social interactions have sculpted the linguistic landscape of the Upper Amazon, offering profound insights into the broader relationship between language, cognition, and the environment. The results promise to enhance our understanding of linguistic diversity as a profound lens through which to view our shared human heritage."

Despite influential programmatic studies and sustained interest, many aspects of the evolution of linguistic diversity remain elusive. Yet, the potential value of understanding linguistic diversity is enormous. It could help us uncover specific past events such as migration and historical contact between societies, perhaps even in very deep time and, more generally, it can give us insight into the interaction between ecology and human behaviour and human cognition. This project will answer these challenges by focussing on the Upper Amazon in western South America, an area which forms a unique microcosm of diversity in which several sociohistorical layers of the continental population history are represented. The north and south are extremely diverse, and likely represent very old diversity patterns. Both areas also show signs of local language contact. The central part is dominated by three language families, which represent expansions of these groups into the Upper Amazon at different stages. This microcosm of diversity forms a unparalleled natural laboratory for understanding more about sociological dynamics and the evolution of linguistic diversity. The project will take an innovative multi-disciplinary approach to unearthing the socio-historical dynamics that have led to these various diversity patterns. In order to do so, geographical, socio-historical, and communicative layers of history are reconstructed and systematically compared, achieving a level of synergy between the disciplines hitherto unseen. Interpreting the (mis)matches between these layers allows for a powerful reconstruction of past events, (e.g. migrations, language shift, exogamy, trade), and sheds light on how these social dynamics shaped linguistic diversity, in turn unlocking the potential of linguistic diversity as a unique window on our past.",
