        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe FLORA project is an ambitious, interdisciplinary research initiative designed to address the urgent need for sustainable and healthy food systems, which are pivotal to combating hunger, climate change, biodiversity loss, health issues, poverty, and fostering sustainable communities. Despite some progress in reducing hunger, the detrimental effects of food systems on the environment and human health are escalating. FLORA seeks to catalyze a necessary global transformation in agri-food production, trade, and consumption.\n\nOur approach is threefold: first, we will conduct a comprehensive diagnosis of the health and environmental outcomes of food systems, incorporating innovative sustainability metrics. Second, we will utilize system dynamics and complex network analyses to pinpoint critical threats and opportunities within these systems. Third, we will develop and assess bespoke solutions through an interdisciplinary modelling framework. This framework will also account for the intricacies of food systems, including trade-offs, synergies, and the dynamics between components, thereby enabling the identification of the most effective interventions.\n\nFLORA's global perspective aims to transcend current methodological barriers by adopting a systemic view and grounding its research in empirical evidence. The project leverages the Principal Investigator's distinguished expertise and success in leading cross-cutting studies on the global agri-food system and its interplay with environmental sustainability. Through FLORA, we will advance knowledge and practical strategies for achieving transformative change in food systems worldwide."

While hunger has receded, food systems are causing increasingly severe damage to our environment and health. The FLORA project will contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption necessary to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems. The project will create essential evidence to identify and implement the shifts in practices and behaviours needed to effectively achieve this transformation, by (1) making a diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, from the production and consumption perspectives, with innovative measures of sustainability, (2) identifying key threats and opportunities with system dynamics and complex network analyses, and (3) targeting and evaluating tailored solutions with an inter-disciplinary modelling framework. The project will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food systems components. Global in scope, it sets the ambitious goal to overcome barriers in current approaches by taking a systemic approach and establishing a robust, interdisciplinary framework supported by empirical advancements to tackle complex food systems challenges. This innovative project builds on the PIâ€™s excellent track record in leading interdisciplinary research focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.",
