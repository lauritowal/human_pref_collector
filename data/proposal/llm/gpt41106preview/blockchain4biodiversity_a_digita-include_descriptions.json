    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to establish a groundbreaking digital platform, ReSeed, aimed at preserving agrobiodiversity through the in situ conservation of farmers’ indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK). Despite the vital role of ISK in global food security and sustainable agriculture, farmers increasingly lack incentives to maintain these practices. Current mechanisms fail to provide intellectual property protection for ISK or to track their utilization, be it for consumption or research. This project addresses the challenge of tracing the origins and uses of ISK by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, decentralized, and immutable record of seed transactions.\n\nReSeed will function as a digital farmers' market that not only facilitates the equitable exchange of ISK but also encourages the reporting of subsequent research and innovation. This initiative will involve a mixed-methods research approach, engaging directly with ISK suppliers and buyers to co-develop the technical specifications and incentive structures for the platform. Additionally, the project will outline how ReSeed can be integrated into existing international legal frameworks with minimal adjustments, ensuring its broad applicability and legal compliance.\n\nThe proposed governance model will incorporate ethics guidelines to foster the platform's responsible adoption and use within small farming communities. Rooted in 12 years of research on incentivizing sustainable innovation with indigenous seeds, ReSeed promises to enhance in situ conservation efforts, stimulate research and innovation in agrobiodiversity, recognize the value of farmers' contributions, and deliver tangible economic and environmental benefits to small-scale farmers. This grant will thus support the creation of a novel mechanism for maintaining biodiversity and fostering a sustainable future for agriculture."

While indigenous seeds can be preserved in seed banks, problems of viability over prolonged storage and rapid climate change necessitate on-farm (in situ) conservation. However, farmers face dwindling economic incentives to cultivate and thereby conserve ISK in situ: ISK is ineligible for protection under intellectual property laws and there are currently no systems in place for tracking the end use to which ISK are put (e.g. end-user consumption or downstream research). The fundamental problem here is in tracing who the first farmer (group) was that put an ISK on the “market”, who accessed it, and what was done with it. Using features of blockchain technology that can help track the flow of ISK in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way, my goal is to develop and test a technical specification for a first-of-its-kind digital farmers’ market (ReSeed) that (i) facilitates equitable and traceable transfers of farmers’ ISK, and (ii) incentivizes honest reporting-back of downstream research and innovation therewith. Using a mixed methods research approach, I will conduct original empirical research with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that will inform ReSeed’s design. I will also demonstrate how ReSeed can be integrated into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments, and create a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers’ communities. ReSeed will build on my 12-year research on means of incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds. It will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers’ ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.",
