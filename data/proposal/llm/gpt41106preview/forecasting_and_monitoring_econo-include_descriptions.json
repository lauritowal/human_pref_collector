        "Abstract:\n\nThe accurate prediction of key economic indicators is an essential component for informed decision-making within financial, governmental, and investment sectors. Recognizing the limitations of existing forecasting software, which often lacks real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown analysis, our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a sophisticated forecasting and monitoring toolbox. Building upon the foundations laid by the ERC-funded starting grant ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests, we have designed novel models and tests that outperform current state-of-the-art methodologies in forecasting economic activity and financial volatility, while also evaluating the reliability of model predictions.\n\nOur ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant proposal is focused on transforming these advanced models and tests into a practical software solution that can be utilized by key economic decision-makers. The proposed toolbox will enhance forecast reliability through the integration of high-frequency data, real-time forecast monitoring, and innovative predictive breakdown tests. These features will be crucial for maintaining forecast accuracy, particularly during periods of economic instability.\n\nWith the intention of refining our product in a real-world context, we will collaborate closely with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank. These partnerships will facilitate the tailoring of our software to meet user needs, including the development of a user-friendly interface and the implementation of a three-dimensional graphical representation for our monitoring and predictive breakdown tests.\n\nThe overarching goal of this ERC PoC grant is to deliver a groundbreaking software tool that can significantly improve the accuracy of economic forecasts. Ultimately, by enhancing the quality of economic predictions, our software will contribute to more prudent economic policymaking and have a positive impact on the growth, and economic and social welfare of countries, firms, and individuals."

In the ERC-funded starting grant (ERC-2007-StG: Change-Point Tests) we developed novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators (such as economic activity, financial volatility and others) as well as evaluating the reliability of model predictions. In many cases our methods improve upon the current-state-of-art. The idea of this ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant is to use these novel models and tests to develop a software/toolbox that forecasts and monitors economic indicators. Most available forecasting software lack real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests which are important for reliable forecasts especially in periods of instability. Our forecasting and monitoring toolbox can improve the reliability of forecasts as follows: (1) using a novel family of models and high frequency information (2) monitoring forecasts in real-time (3) using new predictive tests of potential breakdowns. Such economic forecasts are at the heart of economic decision making made by governments, Central Banks, and firms that are potential users of our toolbox. In this ERC PoC we will initially work with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, given contacts have already been established, in order to examine various aspects of the development of this toolbox such as: building a user-friendly software, developing a three-dimensional graphical representation of the monitoring and predictive breakdown tests, and generally making our new methods accessible to decision makers. The overall objective of this ERC PoC grant is to provide a software with innovative techniques that can improve economic forecasts and thereby economic decision making. Reliable economic forecasts can lead to prudent economic policy making and affect the growth, economic and social welfare of countries, firms and individuals.",
