        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe process of animal domestication marks a pivotal transition in Neolithic societies, yet the early stages of this transformation remain elusive due to the delayed appearance of clear morphological markers. The Research on Early Animal Domestication (READ) project proposes a novel approach to uncover the initial evidence of sheep and goat domestication by examining historical life traits through biogeochemical analysis of fossil teeth. This method offers a high-resolution temporal lens, circumventing the limitations of traditional zooarchaeological analyses which rely on morphological changes that manifest long after domestication has begun. \n\nREAD aims to reconstruct three critical mechanisms indicative of early domestication: control over reproductive cycles, shifts in feeding patterns, and the cessation of migratory behaviors. By integrating innovative scientific techniques, the project will analyze faunal assemblages from the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent—regions quintessential to this field of study. Additionally, READ will compile a reference dataset from both museum specimens of wild ancestors and contemporary populations in breeding centers.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of the project is to provide a transformative understanding of the origin of animal domesticates, focusing on human actions rather than subsequent animal morphologies. This research promises to decode the unresolved paradigms surrounding the inception of animal husbandry, pinpointing how, where, and when caprine management began. Ultimately, READ will offer significant insights into the anthropogenic factors that catalyzed the emergence of domesticated animals, thereby deepening our comprehension of early human-animal relationships and Neolithic societal evolution."

The earliest steps of this phenomenon are, still today, very difficult to achieve. Traditional zooarchaeological analyses used to date domestication rely on detecting the appearance of genetically-driven morphological changes in animals. These morphological markers, however, if they occur at all, only appear after the process is well underway, after hundreds, if not thousands, of years, making it difficult to study them. The READ project will build an alternative approach to detect early evidences of sheep and goat management. The project will investigate the historical life-traits of the animals with a high-resolution time analysis by performing biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth. Scientific approaches employed are not all highly innovative but their combination together with the themes addressed will involve a high-gain. This will allow reconstructing the three clue mechanisms that were pivotal in the lead up to domestication: the control of the animals’ reproductive cycles; the induced changes to their feeding habits; and the interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. The project will evaluate and compare data from what are known to be the three key regions for this research area: the Southern Levant, the Northern Levant and the Eastern Fertile Crescent. READ will analyses a set of the most important and significant available faunal assemblages for these regions and will put together a reference dataset from wild relatives available in museum collections and current living populations found in breeding centres. At the end of the project I will unravel the current unresolved paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates not relying on how the animals changed but rather what the human societies did to change the animals; revealing how early caprine management was done and where and when processes of animal domestication were initiated.",
