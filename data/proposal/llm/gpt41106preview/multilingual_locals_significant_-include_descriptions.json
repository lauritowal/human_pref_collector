        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal aims to redefine the concept of \"world literature\" by exploring the multilingual and diverse literary landscapes of north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, regions with rich traditions of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral heritage. Challenging the dominant paradigm that positions world literature within a monolithic global timeline and map, predominantly through the lens of English translations, our project posits that the current understanding of world literature fails to capture the complexity and plurality of literary practices across the globe. Instead of viewing non-circulating literature as provincial, we propose a situated approach that acknowledges the \"significant geographies\" and \"multilingual locals\" that constitute the true fabric of world literature.\n\nThrough a historical examination spanning three pivotal periods—imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the contemporary globalizing era—our study will delve into the dynamics of local transculturations, debates on world literature, and evolving multilingualism. By focusing on local rather than global, appropriation rather than imitation, and co-constitution rather than diffusion, we seek to illuminate the myriad choices and trajectories that forge both local and transnational literary fields.\n\nOur project will offer a novel theoretical framework, pioneering methods for multilingual research and education, and foster strategic dialogues with scholars and writers from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France. By interrogating the interplay between print and orality, and identifying actors and technologies that shape literary production, we aim to articulate a more authentic and inclusive vision of world literature—one that celebrates its inherent diversity and richness. The outcomes will not only contribute to academic discourse but will also have implications for literary pedagogy and the promotion of a more equitable and representative global literary canon."

It is mostly in English. Its main genre is the novel.” These are caricatures of how World literature as a set of discourses is shaping the field of literary studies, but in fact Non-Western literatures are positioned with reference to a single global timeline and a single map, and translations supposedly ensure that worthy texts enter the global canon. What does not circulate globally is provincial, not good enough, not “world literature”. This picture bears little resemblance to the multilingual world of literature, which consists not of a single map but of many “significant geographies” specific to language, group, and genre. By exploring the often fractured “multilingual locals” and “significant geographies” of literature in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia—each with different experiences of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and continuing oral traditions—we seek to establish a multilingual and located approach to world literature in place of meta-categories like “global” and “world”. Mindful of older histories and networks of literary multilingualism and critical of the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories that partition Anglophone and Francophone literature from Arabic, Amharic, and Hindi/Urdu, we focus on three periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. We will study local transculturations, local debates on world literature, old and new forms of multilingualism, actors and technologies of print and orality, to highlight dynamics of appropriation rather than imitation, co-constitution rather than diffusion, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories that together form local and transnational literary fields (“world literature”). The project will propose a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues with scholars and writers in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, UK and France.",
