        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"RELMIN: The Legal Status of Religious Minorities in Pre-Modern Europe\" aims to explore the historical roots of European religious diversity through the analysis of legal texts that defined the status of religious minorities in medieval societies. Recognizing the interplay between the legal frameworks of various European polities and their treatment of minority religions, the project will create an extensive database of primary sources, including Roman, canon, national, urban, rabbinical, and Islamic law from the early Middle Ages to the pre-modern era.\n\nThis database will feature original texts alongside translations in English, French, and Spanish, accompanied by an annotated bibliography. As a comprehensive resource, it will serve as a vital reference for research on minority law and interreligious dynamics throughout history. The initiative will foster collaborative scholarship by hosting workshops and an international conference, aimed at promoting interdisciplinary dialogue and novel research approaches that transcend conventional scholarly boundaries.\n\nRELMIN will produce three key publications: the conference proceedings, a sourcebook of pivotal legal texts complete with translations and commentaries, and a monograph that examines the legal status of minorities in pre-modern Europe. Through comparative thematic studies, the project will draw parallels between distinct societies, ranging from seventh-century Córdoba to fifteenth-century Krakow, to illustrate varied responses to common issues concerning interreligious relations. By leveraging the expertise of international scholars with diverse linguistic abilities, the project aspires to catalyze innovative studies and enhance our understanding of the historical foundations of religious plurality in Europe."

Medieval European polities, Christian and Muslim, granted protected and inferior status to selected religious minorities. RELMIN will collect, publish and study legal texts defining the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe. The corpus of texts includes Roman law (in particular in the legal codes of Theodosius and Justinian), canon law (acta of Church councils, the Decretum attributed to Gratian, the Decretales), national or royal law (from “barbarian” law codes of the early Middle Ages to national compilations such as the Siete Partidas of Alfonso X of Castile in the thirteenth century), urban law (particularly the fueros in the Iberian peninsula and hisba manuals in Andalusia), rabbinical responsa, and fatwa collections. The database will contain texts in their original languages and translations into English, French and Spanish, as well as an annotated bibliography on the subject. This will become a major reference tool for research in the history of minority law and of interreligious relations. The project will also hold workshops and a major international conference on Religious diversity in pre-modern Europe. A series of comparative thematic studies on specific aspects of interreligious relations will allow us to compare responses to similar issues in diverse societies, from seventh-century Córdoba to fifteenth-century Krakow. The goal is to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work by scholars from different countries with varying linguistic skills, to encourage new innovative research that cuts across traditional divides. The project will publish three major works in the field: the proceedings of the international conference, a sourcebook of selected legal texts (with translations, commentaries and annotated bibliography), and a monograph on the legal status of minorities in pre-modern Europe.",
