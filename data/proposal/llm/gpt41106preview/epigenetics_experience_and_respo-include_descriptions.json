        "**Abstract**\n\nThe NEUROEPIGENETHICS project seeks to critically examine the influence of epigenetic science on the ethical framework surrounding neurodevelopmental disorders. Traditionally, the perception of such conditions has been dichotomized into categories like innate/acquired and biological/psychosocial, heavily relying on the belief that a genetic blueprint defines human characteristics. This simplistic viewpoint has shaped how society and individuals establish capacity responsibility—the ability to modify behavior—and normative responsibility—the moral obligations of both individuals and society towards those with psychiatric diagnoses. However, advancements in epigenetics challenge these binaries by demonstrating that gene expression is significantly affected by social and physical environments, suggesting a more intricate interaction between genetics and neurodevelopment.\n\nOur research will delve into the ethical ramifications of these scientific developments. By employing both theoretical and empirical methodologies, we aim to explore how current professional and stakeholder perceptions of concepts such as \"innate\" and \"biological\" influence the ascription of responsibility. We will assess how the integration of epigenetic knowledge may recalibrate the understanding of capacity and normative responsibility, especially in relation to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nAdditionally, this project will investigate the lived experiences of individuals with these disorders and their families, focusing on how they navigate the interplay between their condition and their biological and social environments. Through this multi-faceted approach, NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to redefine moral responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychiatric practice, in line with the evolving insights provided by epigenetics."

The conceptualization of psychiatric conditions as innate or acquired, biological or psychosocial, genetic or environmental, influences the ascription of both capacity responsibility (the capacity to adapt or adjust one’s own behavior) and normative responsibility of individuals or the society towards those diagnosed. But findings in the field of epigenetics indicate that the social and physical environment influence how genes are expressed. Indeed, epigenetics may shed a new light on distinctions such as innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, biological/psychosocial: a far more complex view on neurodevelopmental disorders may emerge, with ethical implications. However, the implications of epigenetics for discussions on the scope and extent of normative responsibility have not been adequately addressed. NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to investigate the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders. We will use theoretical and empirical methods to investigate how certain concepts (innate/biological/genetic) affect the ways in which professionals and stakeholders (persons with a neurodevelopmental disorder and their families) conceive of responsibility. We will evaluate how the emerging field of epigenetics alters the ascription of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility. We will research how individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)and their families experience the interaction between their condition and their biological and social environment. Finally, we will define moral responsibility in light of the emerging field of epigenetics in the area of neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychiatric practice.",
