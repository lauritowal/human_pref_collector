        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal outlines the INCOMMON project, an innovative research initiative poised to conduct a pioneering study on the interplay between commonality practices and the performing arts, focusing on the pivotal era of the 1960s and 1970s. At its core, INCOMMON seeks to dissect and understand the historical \"laboratory Italy\" context, where a symbiotic relationship between philosophy, politics, and revolutionary practices gave rise to a vibrant artistic counterculture.\n\nThe project's primary goals include: i) investigating the collaborative performance art forms that emerged from interdisciplinary encounters among theatre, music, visual arts, cinema, and video art; ii) employing the 'will-to-the-common' concept to elucidate the countercultural art scene; iii) emphasizing the role of artistic communities both locally and internationally; and iv) establishing a digital archive to preserve and showcase the work of Italian artists from the era in question.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, INCOMMON will integrate insights from historical, philosophical, and artistic discourse with analytical tools from other disciplines, such as sociology and Social Network Theory. This cross-disciplinary approach aims to uncover meaningful patterns within the artistic community and illuminate the unique aspects of their shared creative endeavors.\n\nThe methodological innovations of INCOMMON include the development of new models for interpreting performing arts and the creation of an advanced digital archive visualization system. These tools are designed to enhance the comprehension of the intricate context and dynamics of the relationships under review.\n\nUltimately, the INCOMMON project aspires to compile, digitize, restore, and disseminate a wealth of direct documentation and ancillary materials from Italy's countercultural performing arts heritage. This endeavor will not only safeguard a critical cultural legacy but also ensure its accessibility for future generations, thus preventing the continued loss of this invaluable cultural capital."

The overall objectives of INCOMMON are i) to study, collect and contextualize those encounters between theatre, music, visual arts, cinema and video art that assumed the form of performances, especially those created as collaborations between artists; ii) to apply the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ to the art field of the counterculture; iii) to underline the significance of artistic communities in the local and international scene; iv) to create a digital archive of the performances of the Italian artists of the period. The project will connect historical, philosophical and artistic debates to those in other sciences, sociology and in particular Social Network Theory,in order to reveal significant structures of meanings in the artistic community and to reveal the peculiar characteristics of shared creative processes.The methodology that will be developed is meant 1) to produce new ways of modelling the knowledge and interpretation of performing arts and 2) to create an innovative form of digital archive visualization, where rich interfaces will sustain and improve the understanding of the context and relationships analysed. INCOMMON will produce a comprehensive approach, oriented toward collection, digitalization, restoration and dissemination of direct documentation and related materials of the Italian performing arts production of the great creative, political, existential wave of the counterculture, preserving and making accessible a patrimony that otherwise will continue to be lost to future generations.",
