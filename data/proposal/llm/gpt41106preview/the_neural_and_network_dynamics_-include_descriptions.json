        "**Abstract:**\n\nUnderstanding the intricate dynamics of peer influence is crucial for elucidating adolescent behavior and development. With the advent of social media and its capacity to amplify peer effects, the urgency to dissect the underlying mechanisms of peer influence and the reasons behind adolescents' heightened sensitivity has intensified. This grant proposal aims to construct a theoretical framework and develop innovative computational models to investigate the role of social information in shaping adolescent behavior.\n\nDiverging from traditional views which portray adolescents as mere recipients of social cues, this proposal posits that adolescents are active seekers of social information, propelled by two central inquiries: the optimal timing for and selection of sources for social learning. To explore these dimensions, we will introduce pioneering tasks designed to measure the frequency and conditions under which adolescents seek peer input and their criteria for choosing specific individuals within their social networks as models.\n\nIn a novel approach, we will integrate computational models with functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the nexus between brain maturation, hormonal changes of puberty, and alterations in computational processes that govern social learning. This neurocomputational analysis will shed light on the cognitive transformations that occur during adolescence.\n\nFurthermore, we will conduct empirical studies within actual peer networks to examine social learning. Employing social network analyses, we will assess the impact of peer types and trace the dissemination of behaviors and information through adolescent groups.\n\nThis research is poised to significantly propel our understanding of social learning mechanisms within real-world social contexts. By laying bare the fundamental cognitive and neural underpinnings of peer influence, the results have the potential to guide the development of targeted interventions aimed at mitigating risky behaviors and fostering positive social and educational outcomes among adolescents."

More recently, peer influence seems to be amplified by developments in social media (e.g. viral risk-taking challenges). However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms underlying peer influence, or why adolescents are specifically sensitivity. The primary goal of this proposal is to gain insights in the role of social information in adolescent behavior, by developing a new theoretical framework that will be formalized in novel computational models. First, in contrast with previous accounts, adolescents are not treated as the passive receivers of social information, but considered as agents that play an active role in searching for social information. This search revolves around two main questions: when to search for social information, and who to learn from. To track development in social learning strategies I will develop novel tasks to investigate (1) when, and how much, social information is searched for, and (2) who adolescents will go to. Second, I will employ computational models in combination with functional magnetic imaging to gain insight in how brain development, and pubertal hormones are associated with changes in specific computational processes that are involved in social learning. Thirdly, social learning will for the first time be studied experimentally in real peer social networks. Social network analyses will be used to elucidate the impact of different types of peers, and to study the diffusion of information through peer groups. Our findings will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of social learning in the context of real world social networks. Such fundamental knowledge can inform the development of interventions preventing risk or promoting prosocial behavior and educational outcomes.",
