        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for a historical research project that aims to deepen our understanding of social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine within the transformative period of 1880 to 1920. This era, marked by the forces of imperialism, globalisation, and Ottoman state building, witnessed significant human mobility and migration, resulting in intense social differentiation. The proposed research will investigate the social strategies employed by the diverse communities of late Ottoman Palestinians to navigate the myriad challenges of the time, spanning ethnic, religious, and class divides.\n\nCentral to the project is the exploration of individual and collective practices that facilitated social advancement or economic resilience. The guiding hypothesis is that an accumulation of individual actions contributed to the persistent formation and reformation of social structures. By employing census data as a primary source, the project aims to develop benchmarks for comparing social practices regionally and internationally, thus offering a novel contribution to the broader narrative of global social and cultural history.\n\nThe research intends to create a theoretical framework and methodological standards that can be applied to similar studies, with a particular focus on the implementation of an Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire. This innovation promises to revolutionize the way social historians approach the spatial analysis of historical data. Moreover, the comparative aspect of this study may provide fresh insights into the nature of colonialism, especially under the British Mandate, by juxtaposing it against other historical contexts.\n\nThrough this project, the researcher aspires to set new precedents in the analysis of social formations and contribute to the academic discourse on historical globalization, state building, and the enduring impact of the Ottoman Empire's legacy."

Therefore, in this period we find the roots of many social formations that have remained relevant until the present. My focus is on the individual and collective practices for coping with various challenges and on census-taking as a social process. It will open up new perspectives on social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine, in a historical context defined by European imperialism, Ottoman state building and globalisation. The main research question is: which social strategies did late Ottoman Palestinians employ, across ethnic, religious and class divides, to confront challenges on the individual and collective levels? These include fostering social advancement of oneâ€™s household or coping with economic stress. My hypothesis is that an accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. Using the census process and its data I will establish yardsticks that will make it possible to compare social practices across the region and beyond, and thus contribute to ongoing efforts to write a global social and cultural history and it will develop a theoretical framework and methodological standards that will be useful for similar research projects. Specifically, the project aims to set new standards for how to realise the vision of an HGIS for the entire Ottoman Empire. Enabling comparison with other sources it may also offer intriguing new perspectives for the study of colonialism, notably under the British Mandate.",
