        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThe MERLIT project represents the inaugural comprehensive exploration into the literary evolution and cultural impact of meritocratic narratives. This ambitious investigation is poised to dissect the multifaceted manifestations of merit-based ideologies that pervade global societies, from the foundational \"pursuit of happiness\" in the United States to the pervasive themes of self-advancement in neoliberal discourse. Despite the popularity and critique of meritocratic narratives for their dual roles as agents of empowerment and instruments of societal inequity, scholarly examination has largely overlooked the literary principles that construct or confront these narratives.\n\nMERLIT seeks to fill three critical voids in contemporary research: firstly, by scrutinizing the narrative techniques that both shape and question the meritocratic ethos; secondly, by broadening the investigative lens to include non-Western and transcultural literary contributions, particularly those emerging from the Global South; and thirdly, by tracing the historical trajectory of meritocratic thought from the 17th century to contemporary times, challenging the misconception of its novelty.\n\nStructured into six distinct work packages, MERLIT's methodology is designed to dissect the role of literary practices in both reinforcing and critiquing meritocratic narratives. This exploration extends beyond the traditional Western canon, incorporating radical and innovative textual practices from diverse cultures and geographies.\n\nAs a cross-disciplinary endeavor situated at the confluence of literary history, new formalism, and cultural translation, MERLIT is set to revolutionize our comprehension of meritocratic narratives. It seeks not only to map a literary history of meritocratic thought but to profoundly enhance our understanding of literature's power to shape worldviews and contribute to the construction and deconstruction of social hierarchies. The anticipated outcome is a groundbreaking body of knowledge that elucidates the complex interplay between literature and the pervasive ideology of meritocracy."

Meritocratic thinking manifests itself in powerful narratives across the globe, from the constitutionally embedded “pursuit of happiness” to neoliberal narratives of self-enhancement. MERLIT investigates forms of these narratives, which are embraced for their seemingly empowering and universalist appeal, but also criticised for their enmeshment with structures of domination and privilege. MERLIT explores how meritocratic narratives are written, how they are written into cultures, but also how they are written back to in text forms that have shaped the zeitgeist of particular moments respectively. Although research into meritocratic thinking is a vibrant interdisciplinary field, it is characterised (1) by a lack of investigations into the formal principles underpinning – or challenging – meritocratic articulations, (2) by a narrow focus on (white) Western contexts and (3) by a concentration on recent developments. To counter these gaps, (1) MERLIT explores in six work packages how practices of writing have played, and continue to play, crucial roles in shaping meritocratic articulations but also critiques thereof; (2) MERLIT expands the contextual focus of existing scholarship by engaging with radical writing practices from the Global South and a range of transculturally entangled anglophone contexts; eventually, (3) MERLIT challenges perceptions of meritocratic thinking and its critiques as recent phenomena by engaging with changing forms of articulating value, merit and success from the 17th century to the present. Situated at the intersections of literary history, new formalist theory and cultural translation, MERLIT not only offers a literary history of meritocratic thought, but significantly advances our understanding of the workings of a set of hegemonic forms in and through writing, and of the formative, worldmaking role of literature.",
