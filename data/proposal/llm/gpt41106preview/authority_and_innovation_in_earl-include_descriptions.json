        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal requests support for INNOVATION, a project set to revolutionize the understanding of the origins of modern Western philosophy by bringing to light the underestimated contributions of early thirteenth-century Franciscan thinkers. Challenging the long-standing perception that early Franciscans merely replicated previous doctrines while later members of the order were the true innovators, this research aims to demonstrate the early Franciscans' groundbreaking role in shaping Western philosophical identity.\n\nThe proposed study is poised to be the first exhaustive investigation into the sources, methods, content, and impact of early Franciscan thought on the later medieval period. A pioneering 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach will be employed to analyze scholastic texts, revealing how practical engagement shaped theoretical advancements during the high Middle Ages. This novel interpretive strategy is anticipated to not only redefine scholarly engagement with scholasticism but also to uncover the original use of Islamic sources by early Franciscans, thus identifying underrecognized intellectual connections between early and late Franciscan scholarship.\n\nThe project's broader implications include highlighting a shared philosophical lineage between Muslim and Western traditions, a finding with significant potential to address current societal divisions by emphasizing a historically shared intellectual heritage. Furthermore, the research will explore the transformation of Franciscan ideas, tracing how they only attained a 'modern' character when abstracted from their original practice-led framework.\n\nBy juxtaposing philosophy with religious practice, INNOVATION promises to deliver a nuanced account of the Franciscan contribution to the genesis of modern Western thought, thereby advancing scholarly knowledge and potentially fostering intercultural dialogue. This grant will facilitate a historical reevaluation that positions early Franciscan thought as a foundational pillar in the construction of our contemporary philosophical landscape."

This breakthrough will be achieved by exposing the pioneering nature of early thirteenth-century Franciscan thought and its pivotal significance for the subsequent formation of the Western philosophical identity. The work of early Franciscans has largely been neglected in scholarly circles, on the assumption that they merely codified the work of past authorities, where later Franciscans developed innovative ideas that laid the foundation for the development of modern philosophy. INNOVATION will contest this assumption by producing the first comprehensive study of the sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought. In conducting this study, I will implement a groundbreaking method of reading scholastic texts, which is attentive to the way that practice informed theory in the high Middle Ages. This ‘practice-led’ hermeneutic will provide a resource for re-envisaging the entire state of the art in the study of scholasticism. As regards early Franciscans, it will allow me to identify novelty, often due to the use of Islamic sources, where past scholars have perceived unoriginality. On this basis, I will highlight previously unnoticed connections between the early and late Franciscan schools. By these means, I will illustrate how Western thought has been nourished by the ethos of a particular religious order and by Islamic thought, pointing up a shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity that is often overlooked but urgently needed to overcome severe fractures in today’s society. At the same time, I will emphasize that Franciscan ideas only became modern once removed from their practice-led context. In juxtaposing the cultural paradigms of philosophy and religious practice, consequently, I will advance knowledge by producing the first nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought.",
