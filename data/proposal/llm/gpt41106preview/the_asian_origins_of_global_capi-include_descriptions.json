        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe trajectory of global capitalism and its underlying mechanisms remain a subject of profound historical importance, especially as the West experiences a shift away from traditional industrialization. The CAPASIA project seeks to explore the genesis and development of modern industrial capitalism by examining an often-overlooked crucible of economic dynamism: the Asian port 'factories' of the Indian Ocean from the early modern period (1500-1800). These factories, European-controlled trading posts once managed by agents known as 'factors,' were pivotal in the assembly, storage, and shipment of goods for intercontinental trade. They not only laid the groundwork for today's concept of factories as sites of production but also served as bustling hubs of global exchange well before the advent of 20th-century Special Economic Zones.\n\nThis research initiative aims to construct a new spatial theory of capitalist development, offering a counter-narrative to the Atlantic plantation-centric models posited by the New History of Capitalism. Through a comprehensive study of over 150 factories, CAPASIA will investigate the economic operations within these imperial centers, the collaborative and competitive interactions between European and indigenous merchants, and the overarching patterns of movement among goods, people, and information throughout this network of ports.\n\nBy integrating extensive archival sources from both European East India companies and Asian historical records, CAPASIA also endeavors to contribute to the 'decolonization' of capitalism's history. This five-year project will not only map intricate commercial activities but will also engage with a diverse array of international scholars, aiming to reshape the narrative of economic evolution by placing Asian and European actors on equal footing within the broader context of global capitalism. CAPASIA's research is poised to redefine our understanding of these transformative centuries and their enduring impact on contemporary economic structures."

CAPASIA locates the origins of modern industrial capitalism in the space of Asian ports in the Indian Ocean, where the Portuguese, as well as the Dutch, English, French, and other European East India companies operated in the early modern period (1500-1800). Well before the rise of 20th-century Special Economic Zones and world financial centres, the ports of maritime Asia (‘factories’) were areas of global trade and hubs of economic dynamism. Today ‘factories’ are places of industrial production, but they owe their name to these pre-modern Asian trading ports, European-controlled trade hubs headed by company servants called ‘factors’. Factories were places where commodities for intercontinental trade were assembled, stored and shipped. This project investigates the genesis, evolution, activities, and connections of over 150 small and large such factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development — complementing and challenging the current Atlantic plantation-based explanations proposed by the New History of Capitalism. CAPASIA’s integration of the large archival repositories of the different European East India companies and Asian archives will also be the basis for the ‘decolonization’ of the history of capitalism. Over its five-year duration, this project will ask: what kind of economic activities were carried out in these imperial trading centres? What were the interactive roles of European and local merchants? It will map the intercontinental movement of goods, people and information across an ‘archipelago’ of Asian ports. Working with collaborators from across the globe, CAPASIA’s overarching ambition is to recast the narrative of global economic change and capitalism by incorporating both Asian and European economic actors, and their interactions, in the space of the still unstudied factories of the Indian Ocean.",
