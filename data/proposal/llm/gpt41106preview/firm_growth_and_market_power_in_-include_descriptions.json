        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the context of a globalized economy, comprehensive understanding of firm behavior is crucial for crafting policies that foster a dynamic and competitive market. This research proposal, BIGlobal, aims to delve into the underpinnings of firm growth and market power, offering new perspectives on welfare and policy implications in an international setting. Despite the general assumption that markets efficiently distribute resources, the reality is that large firms, particularly those operating across borders, significantly influence economic activities. BIGlobal seeks to ascertain how these firms' decisions affect overall benefits from globalization, the distribution of these gains, and the consequent policy formulation.\n\nOver the forthcoming five-year period, the project will integrate sophisticated firm behavior into international trade models to scrutinize the effects of trade and industrial policies on growth trajectories, with an emphasis on developing economies. The research will address pivotal questions: How do trade and competition policies ensure consumer benefits in a landscape where trading firms wield considerable market power? What role do domestic policies play in enabling small farmers to capitalize on trade? How do industrial policies drive firm expansion through input linkages? And what is the influence of banking globalization on the growth of real-sector firms?\n\nEach facet of the project will synergize theoretical frameworks with empirical data from developing countries, striving to push the boundaries of our understanding of trade and industrial policy. The outcomes of BIGlobal will not only contribute to academic discourse but also serve as a foundation for informed and effective policymaking, ensuring that the fruits of globalization are equitably shared and contribute to the welfare of all stakeholders involved."

The objective of my future research is to provide such an analysis. BIGlobal will examine the sources of firm growth and market power to provide new insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Much of analysis of the global economy is set in the paradigm of markets that allocate resources efficiently and there is little role for policy. But big firms dominate economic activity, especially across borders. How do firms grow and what is the effect of their market power on the welfare impact of globalization? This project will determine how firm decisions matter for the aggregate gains from globalization, the division of these gains across different individuals and their implications for policy design. Over the next five years, I will incorporate richer firms behaviour in models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact the growth process, especially in less developed markets. The specific questions I will address include: how can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms engaged in international trade have market power, how do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect the extent to which small farmers gain from trade, how do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages, and what is the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector. Each project will combine theoretical work with rich data from developing economies to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and to provide a basis for informed policymaking.",
