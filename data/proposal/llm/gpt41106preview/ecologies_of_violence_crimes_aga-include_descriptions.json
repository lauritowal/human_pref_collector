        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, EcoViolence, seeks to explore and articulate the complex relationship between cultural representation and environmental destruction. As the natural world faces unprecedented threats, the project examines the role of contemporary culture in grappling with the attendant issues of memory and culpability. This inquiry is particularly focused on the ways in which writers, artists, and filmmakers draw upon and adapt historical narratives of mass atrocities, such as the Holocaust and slavery, to respond to the challenges of representing ecocide and extinction.\n\nEcoViolence endeavors to be the pioneering transnational and comparative analysis of the cultural imaginary surrounding environmental violence. The project aims to merge insights from cultural memory studies and ecocriticism to formulate an ecological model for the study of violence and its portrayal. The research will document the manifestation of ecoviolence in various cultural mediums, examine the connections made between environmental degradation and historical forms of violence, and critically assess the cultural discourse around guilt, responsibility, and the complicity of culture itself in the violence it illustrates.\n\nA significant aspect of the project is the investigation into how cultural representations elicit emotional engagement, facilitating a deeper connection to environmental issues and fostering introspection. By reorienting both cultural memory research and ecocriticism, EcoViolence will provide a novel framework that conceptualizes violence and memory in an ecological context.\n\nThe outcome of the project will include a \"best practices\" guide for integrating these cultural representations into educational settings. The goal is to enhance critical literacies concerning ecoviolence and to transcend reductive narratives that inhibit comprehensive responses to our shared ecological crisis. Ultimately, EcoViolence aims to contribute to a broader understanding and more effective pedagogy that equips individuals to confront and address the complexities of environmental violence."

How do we remember the victims, both human and non-human? And who is to blame? Contemporary culture plays a crucial role in addressing these questions. Large-scale processes like ecocide and extinction pose significant conceptual and representational challenges. This project posits that writers, artists and filmmakers are responding to these challenges by adapting existing repertoires, especially ones that emerged in response to the Holocaust, slavery, and other atrocities. In so doing they reveal the historical, structural and discursive links between crimes against humanity and crimes against nature. EcoViolence will be the first comprehensive, transnational, comparative study of the cultural imaginary of environmental violence. Bringing together recent work in cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will develop an innovative ecological model for the study of violence and its representation. We will document how texts, films, art works, plays and exhibitions represent ecoviolence; map how they link it to colonialism and genocide; and analyse how they reflect on questions of guilt and responsibility, as well as culture’s own implication in the violence it depicts. Furthermore, we will explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to help people relate to the environmental crisis and promote critical self-reflection. EcoViolence will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research and ecocriticism by providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms. The project will result in a “best practices” guide to engage cultural representations in pedagogy to enhance critical literacies about ecoviolence and move beyond simplistic stories where everyone is either a victim or a perpetrator that have stifled full responses to our collective ecocidal trajectories.",
