        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: POSTNORM – Ideological Brand Rejection in New Democracies**\n\nThis proposal presents POSTNORM, an innovative research project aimed at developing a unifying theory to explain disparate patterns of political alignment and party success in new democracies. Central to POSTNORM's hypothesis is the premise that the ideological branding of past authoritarian regimes significantly influences contemporary political norms, affecting voters' and political elites' ideological affiliations. The project investigates the phenomenon whereby the ideological orientation of a former authoritarian regime—be it left or right—leads to a societal avoidance of that particular ideology in the post-authoritarian political landscape.\n\nPOSTNORM will employ cutting-edge survey experiments to scrutinize the impact of past regime ideology on current political behavior and party competition in new democracies. The research will explore how this historical bias manifests in various aspects: it shapes voter ideology, influences perceptions of party positions, affects national identity, guides political discourse, and determines the emergence and evolution of political parties.\n\nThrough its analytical framework, POSTNORM aims to generate testable predictions about voter demand and party supply dynamics, offering a coherent explanation for observed variations in political competition across new democracies. The project's findings are expected to provide a novel interpretive lens for the study of political behavior, facilitating a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between historical legacies and modern party politics."

Why has Portugal been one of the last countries in Western Europe to see a radical right party in the national parliament? Why are right-wing individuals more likely to protest in Eastern Europe than left-wing individuals (Kostelka and Rovny 2019)? POSTNORM proposes a theory postulating that these seemingly unrelated patterns are the product of a single process: the rejection of the ideological brand of the past authoritarian regime. Through novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will examine how in new democracies, the ideological associations with the old regime serve as a focal point for norms that govern what are appropriate political positions for voters and parties: in democracies following left(right-)wing dictatorship, voters and political elites avoid associating themselves with the left(right) respectively. POSTNORM further derives a set of testable expectations about how this bias shapes both the demand- and the supply side of party competition. The bias colors citizens’ ideological preferences; perceptions about parties’ stances in these issues; national identity; political discussions; the supply of new parties; post-transition party names and pro-grammatic stances; and party elite discourse. POSTNORM will deliver a parsimonious new theory that will help make sense of heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies",
