        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe early twentieth century witnessed a transformative \"formal turn\" in the philosophy of science and logic, marked by the prioritization of formal methods and the widespread adoption of formalism. Our proposed research project aims to conduct the first interdisciplinary and comparative examination of the inception and influence of formalist approaches within this pivotal historical context. The project consists of three interrelated subprojects, which together encompass the historical, comparative, and philosophical dimensions of this intellectual shift.\n\nThe first subproject adopts a historical lens, focusing on the evolution of formalist thought in nineteenth-century mathematics and neo-Kantian epistemology. It seeks to chart the methodological shifts in geometry and algebra from 1860 to 1910 that laid the groundwork for formalism, while also exploring its philosophical underpinnings, particularly within the Marburg school's interpretation of scientific objectivity.\n\nOur second subproject undertakes a comparative analysis of the formal turn as it unfolded within the realms of logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940. Key figures and schools, such as the Göttingen school and proponents of logical empiricism, will be scrutinized to elucidate their foundational roles in the formalization of mathematics and logic.\n\nThe final subproject explores the broader philosophical ramifications of the formal turn, tracing its impact on the development of semantics theories in logic and philosophy. The project will connect early formalist contributions to current debates in the philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical analysis of scientific theories.\n\nBy achieving a comprehensive understanding of the formal turn's origins and implications, this project aims to shed new light on a critical period in the history of philosophy and science and to inform contemporary discussions within these fields."

This shift is characterized by a new emphasis on formal methods and the adoption of a general formalist viewpoint towards the disciplines in question. The project will give a first interdisciplinary and comparative study of early contributions to formalism in twentieth-century thought. This general objective will be addressed in terms of three interrelated subprojects. The first subproject is historical in character and aims at a historical reconstruction of the emergence of formalist thinking in nineteenth-century mathematics and neo-Kantian epistemology. On the mathematical side, the project will retrace several methodological developments in geometry and algebra between 1860 and 1910 that contributed to a formalist conception of these fields. Regarding its philosophical roots, the focus will be on contributions to a formalist notion of scientific objectivity in the work of the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism (Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, Paul Natorp). The second subproject will give a comparative study of the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940. This includes research on the foundations of mathematics and the formality of logic by members of the Göttingen school (David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen) as well as central contributions to a scientific formalism in logical empiricism (Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick). The third subproject will analyze the philosophical implications of the formal turn for the subsequent shaping of these fields. The emergence of formalist thinking was closely related to the development of new theories of semantics in logic and philosophy. The aim will therefore be to connect the early contributions to formalism with contemporary debates on the philosophy of model theory and inferentialism as well as with the logical study of scientific theories.",
