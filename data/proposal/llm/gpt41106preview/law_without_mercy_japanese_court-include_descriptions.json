        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents \"Law without Mercy,\" an innovative historical research project aimed at delving into the role of military justice in Japan's conduct during the Asia-Pacific War of 1937-1945. The project seeks to investigate how Japan's system of courts-martial and military courts, established throughout East and Southeast Asia, became instruments of violence, both reflecting and perpetuating the brutality of war. The research will critically examine the tripartite objectives of this legal apparatus: to regulate and channel violence in alignment with Japan's war aims, to enforce compliance among civilians with the imposed 'New Order' in East Asia, and to project a semblance of legitimacy and legality to domestic and international observers.\n\nDespite the veneer of judicial proceedings, the outcomes were often fatal, with sentences typically culminating in execution or severe incarceration. \"Law without Mercy\" aims to fill a significant void in the historiography by conducting a systematic study of mass violence through the prism of military justice. This approach is unique in considering legal practice not merely as a sideshow to wartime atrocities but as a central mechanism enabling and exacerbating the violence on both the battlefield and in occupied regions.\n\nThe project's novelty extends to its methodological framework, where it will undertake extensive archival research, unlocking a new and rich repository of sources that can shed light on the under-documented aspects of Japan's wartime actions. By situating itself at the crossroads of modern Japanese history and international law, the project leverages the principal investigator's dual expertise to provide an in-depth analysis of the complex interplay between law, warfare, and violence.\n\nThe insights gleaned from \"Law without Mercy\" promise to extend beyond academic circles, offering contemporary relevance and practical implications for addressing the persistent and intricate challenges of war and humanitarian law in today's conflict-ridden global landscape."

Wherever Japanese soldiers went, judge-advocates followed, meeting out stern justice to soldiers, civilians and enemy soldiers alike. The system of courts-martial and military courts throughout East and Southeast Asia served three purposes: regulate violence and channel it efficiently to serve Japan's war goals; deter the civilian population and coerce it into following Japan's 'New Order' in East Asia; and finally, convince domestic and international audiences that Japan's war was not only legitimate, but also 'legal'. Yet, despite formal pretences, verdicts routinely ended in execution or harsh imprisonment. As such, the violence of the justice system mirrored the brutality of the war in general. Despite the highly contentious nature of the war even today, a systematic study of mass violence during the Asia-Pacific War has been sorely lacking. 'Law without Mercy' undertakes this daunting task by using military justice as focal point and as a highly precise lens for studying the various figurations of violence during the war. It is pioneering in analysing legal practice as an integral part of this violence and facilitator for its routinisation and escalation on the battlefield and in the occupied territories. And finally, it opens up a wholly new and large body of sources through original archival work that helps to overcome the notorious direness of documentation on Japan's conduct during the war. Situated at the intersection of several historical fields, 'Law without Mercy' capitalises on the double expertise of the PI in modern Japanese history and international law. With the complex and precarious relation between law, war and violence still at the heart of humanitarian issues, the historical insights of this project have very practical implications for our conflict-laden world today.",
