        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal concerns a comprehensive research project designed to reassess the implications of firm heterogeneity for international trade patterns and welfare outcomes. The project is timely and critical, as it addresses contemporary concerns over protectionism and the backlash against globalization evident in Europe and worldwide. The investigation will explore the extent to which traditional trade models—based on assumptions of homogeneous firms—fail to capture significant dimensions of global economic interactions and their consequences for allocative efficiency, optimal trade policy design, comparative advantages, and export capabilities.\n\nThis research will be organized into four interrelated work packages, each delving into a distinct aspect of how firm-level diversity shapes international trade dynamics. The first work package will assess the impact of firm heterogeneity on aggregate economic performance, focusing on how market imperfections and economic integration influence allocative efficiency. The second will theorize on the role of firm heterogeneity in crafting multilateral trade policies aimed at enhancing collective welfare, suggesting new frameworks for cooperative trade agreements. The third work package will investigate the interplay between country, sector, and firm-specific traits in shaping trade liberalization outcomes, offering nuanced insights into comparative advantages. Finally, the fourth work package will analyze the influence of firm heterogeneity on a country’s exporting potential, examining the productivity spectrum of domestic firms.\n\nThrough these investigations, the project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics of international trade in the context of firm diversity, informing policy decisions that can better align individual incentives with societal objectives in an increasingly interconnected global economy."

Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? Should governments intervene to promote or restrict international transactions? Questions like these have recently gained new salience, in Europe and elsewhere, due to renewed protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies arising from diffuse disenchantment with globalization. The aim of the research project is to highlighting key dimensions along which the answers to these questions obtained from conventional trade models with homogenous firms should be revisited in the light of permanent pervasive firm heterogeneity. In particular, the project will pursue four specific objectives through four integrated work packages providing new insights on how firm heterogeneity affects: (1) the ability of markets to deliver allocative efficiency; (2) The design of optimal multilateral trade policies; (3) The comparative advantages of countries; (4) The capabilities of a country as an exporter. The first work package will investigate whether the allocative inefficiency (“misallocation”) determined by firm heterogeneity in the presence of pricing distortions is quantitatively relevant for a country’s aggregate economic performance, and whether economic integration reduces or exacerbates such misallocation. The second work package will develop the theoretical implications of firm heterogeneity for trade policy, with special emphasis on the cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements aimed at maximizing the joint welfare of all trade partners. The third work package will study how country, sector and firm characteristics interact to determine countries’ responses to trade liberalization. The fourth work package will investigate the distinct role of firm heterogeneity in determining a country’s ability to export through the shape of the productivity distribution of its producers.",
