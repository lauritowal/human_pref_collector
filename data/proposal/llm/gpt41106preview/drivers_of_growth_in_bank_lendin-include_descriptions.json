        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThe recurrence of banking crises, often triggered by surges in credit growth, has emphasized the need for a macroprudential approach to financial regulation aimed at mitigating the spillover from financial disruptions to the broader economy. Despite the consensus on the need for regulatory measures, empirical evidence on the specific factors contributing to credit growth and subsequent crises remains inconclusive. This gap is largely due to the complexity of the global banking system and the scarcity of comprehensive micro-level data, which hinders the simultaneous examination of all relevant factors.\n\nThis project seeks to isolate and analyze key factors implicated in the acceleration of credit expansion preceding the most recent financial crisis, including financial innovations like loan securitization, the surge in mortgage lending, real estate price fluctuations, borrower information asymmetries, and the elevated leverage of financial institutions. By utilizing a robust set of micro-level datasets, our research aims to identify and quantify the influence of each factor on loan growth, filling the empirical void with rigorous methodological approaches. Where theoretical frameworks are absent, the project will develop new models to support the analysis.\n\nMoreover, the project will explore how these factors may interact, collectively contributing to the dynamics of credit growth. The focus on individual settings within the datasets, coupled with the application of tailored methodologies, will ensure the external validity of our findings. Ultimately, the research outcomes will provide critical insights for policymakers and regulators, informing the design of effective financial regulations that can preempt and mitigate the adverse effects of future banking crises. The project's commitment to methodological rigor and the novel use of micro-level data promise to make a significant contribution to the field of financial economics and stability."

Their damaging real effects have generated a broad agreement among academics and policymakers that financial regulation needs to tighten and to obtain a macroprudential dimension that aims to lessen the negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector. Among the main ingredients that are often mentioned to have played a role in the explosive growth of credit in the run-up to the latest financial crisis are the financial innovations by financial institutions, in particular loan securitization, the boom in mortgage lending and prices of real estate, the lack of information about prospective borrowers, and the high leverage (and corresponding low capital ratios) of financial institutions. Yet, despite the singling out of these ingredients by policymakers, decisive empirical evidence about their role and relevancy is lacking. However, given the magnitude and complexity of the global banking system and the lack of encompassing micro-level data, it is currently impossible to confidently study the impact of all ingredients jointly. This project therefore analyses pertinent settings where we can empirically identify the correspondence between the aforementioned individual ingredients and the credit granting by financial institutions. The objective of the project is to advance identification and estimation of the impact of each respective factor on loan growth by combining the appropriate methodology with an exceptional set of micro-level datasets. When missing in the literature a theoretical framework will be provided. The project further aims to assess how potential combinations of these ingredients may have interacted in spurring credit growth. While the identification of the impact of each ingredient on credit growth is paramount, the individual setting of the studied datasets and employed methodologies will ensure maximum external validity.",
