        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the LANDRESPONSE project, which aims to examine the correlation between land dispossession and the emergence of violent resistance and migration among smallholders in the Sahel region, with a particular focus on Mali. The project posits that smallholders deprived of land are more likely to engage in violent resistance or to migrate, a phenomenon that has been observed alongside the rise of armed groups often labelled as 'jihadist'. By employing a mixed-methods approach, this research will delve into the relationship between loss of land rights, exploitation by rent-seeking elites, and the choices smallholders make in response, whether it be engaging in violent opposition or seeking life elsewhere in North Africa or Europe.\n\nThe project's first objective is to ascertain if there is a definitive link between land dispossession and the inclination towards violent resistance or migration among smallholders in the West African Sahel. The second objective seeks to understand the factors that cause some dispossessed smallholders to resort to violence while others submit to their circumstances. LANDRESPONSE is at the intersection of political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, and aims to contribute to both academic discourse and policy development. \n\nWith its innovative approach to pressing political issues, the project endeavors to uncover the underlying motivations and actions of smallholders facing the dual threats of conflict and unstable land governance. Ultimately, LANDRESPONSE will provide groundbreaking insights into the complex dynamics at play in the Sahel, informing future research and shaping policy interventions aimed at mitigating conflict and managing migration in the region."

The hypothesis of LANDRESPONSE is that smallholders who are dispossessed of access to land are more inclined to either migrate or resist violently. Violent resistance will be studied in this project with regard to the increasing numbers of armed groups labelled ‘jihadist’ in the Sahel and in particular in Mali. The project will investigate the nature of the links between land dispossession and elite capture on the one hand and violent jihadist resistance to governments as well as migration to North Africa and Europe on the other hand. These hypothesized links will be investigated using mixed methods with a particular focus on Mali as a ‘hub’ country in the Western Sahel in terms of both violence and migration. Following this conceptual framework, the objectives directing the project will be – first to investigate whether smallholders in the West African Sahel who are dispossessed of their land and/or fall victim to rent-seeking elites, are more inclined to either resist violently or migrate, and second try to assess why some smallholders are more prone to resist, even violently, while others remain compliant. With its pioneering engagement with these urgent political issues, the project will combine theoretical and empirical approaches from political ecology, critical agrarian studies and peace and conflict studies to generate novel insights about the motivations and agency of smallholders confronted with emerging challenges to their livelihoods. This interdisciplinary research will generate new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts and migration, which will both push the research frontier and provide new ideas for policy formulation.",
