        "Abstract:\n\nThe development of parental caregiving is a crucial aspect of human evolution and species survival, intricately linked with infant well-being and developmental outcomes. While the role of infant facial cues in eliciting adult caregiving responses has been posited by Darwin and Lorenz, modern neuroimaging techniques have only recently begun to elucidate the corresponding brain circuitry. The proposed research seeks to fill crucial gaps in knowledge regarding the neurodevelopmental trajectory of new parents and the brain mechanisms disrupted during atypical caregiving situations. This multidisciplinary study will employ longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, advanced neuroimaging, psychological assessments, and computational modeling to achieve its objectives.\n\nSubproject 1 aims to longitudinally track the structural and functional brain changes in new mothers and fathers from pre-pregnancy through the initial stages of caregiving, correlating these changes with behavioral measures obtained from standardized caregiving tasks. Subproject 2 will investigate the consequences of disrupted caregiving, focusing on two prevalent challenges: parental sleep deprivation and infant craniofacial anomalies, such as cleft lip and palate. Through cross-sectional analysis, this subproject will assess the impact of these disruptions on brain function and caregiving behaviors.\n\nFinally, Subproject 3 will synthesize insights from normal and disrupted caregiving pathways to construct a comprehensive model of the brain mechanisms underpinning parental caregiving. By leveraging existing advanced computational models, this subproject will integrate neuroimaging and behavioral data to reveal the core brain networks and mechanisms involved in the development of parenting.\n\nThe outcomes of this research promise to advance our understanding of the neurobiological substrates of parental caregiving, with implications for interventions that support at-risk parents and optimize child developmental trajectories."

Human infants are, however, vulnerable and completely dependent on caregiving parents, not just for survival but also for their development. Darwin and Lorenz have long argued that there are specific infant facial features that elicit attention and responsiveness in adults. Until recently this has not been possible to study but neuroimaging has started to reveal some of the brain circuitry. However, it is not known how the brain changes over time in new parents as they gain experience with caregiving. Equally, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms associated with disruption to normal parental caregiving. I propose to study the brain changes associated with normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents who will undergo neuroimaging and psychological testing using standardised databases and test batteries of caregiving tasks. Subproject 1 will investigate the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy, using a longitudinal study of structural and functional brain changes in both women and men combined with their behavioural measures on caregiving tasks. Subproject 2 will investigate the disrupted development of parental caregiving using a cross-sectional design to study the brain and behavioural effects on caregiving during potential disruptive changes to the parent or child. Specifically, my focus will be on A) parental sleep disruption and B) infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate. Finally, understanding the full brain mechanisms and architecture underlying parental caregiving requires a mechanistic synthesis of the findings of normal and disrupted development. Subproject 3 will use our existing advanced computational models to combine the findings from normal and disrupted development in order to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting.",
