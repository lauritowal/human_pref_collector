        "Abstract:\n\nThe DEMOLAW project aims to revolutionize our understanding of the intricacies involved in the legislative processes of democratic societies. At the heart of a functioning democracy lies the crucial task of integrating diverse perspectives into cohesive laws—a task that has become increasingly complex in today's politically charged environment. Despite the profound impact legislation has on both the daily lives of citizens and the effectiveness of democratic governance, the connection between the design, enactment, and endurance of laws remains largely unexplored.\n\nThis pioneering initiative will scrutinize legislative texts from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union using advanced computational techniques to dissect three pivotal questions: the empirical measurement of law design through textual attributes, the reasons behind variations in law design across different laws, policy areas, and political systems, and the factors contributing to the stability or constant evolution of laws.\n\nThe DEMOLAW project's first breakthrough contribution is the development of a new conceptual framework for understanding the architecture of democratic laws. By focusing on two fundamental dimensions, versatility and precision, the project will deliver unprecedented insights into the substantive content of legislation. This approach allows for a pioneering comparative analysis of legislative outputs, offering a holistic view of policy-making across various domains and systems over time.\n\nSecondly, by proposing and evaluating an integrated theoretical model, the project aims to advance the academic discourse in comparative public policy by elucidating both the genesis and the persistence of democratic laws.\n\nLastly, the project will set a new standard in legislative studies with its innovative methodological approach. By harnessing computational analysis, DEMOLAW will expand the possibilities for examining the content and decision-making processes behind democratic legislation, thereby making a profound contribution to the field."

Given the increasingly hostile political climate around the world, solving this task has never been more difficult and more important than today. Yet, despite the crucial relevance of laws for our daily lives and the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic government, our understanding of how the design, creation and long-term survival of legislation are related is still very limited. The DEMOLAW project analyses legislative texts in three different political systems (US, UK, EU) with cutting-edge computational methods to answer three major research questions: (1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law and how can we exploit textual properties of law texts to measure these dimensions empirically? (2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary across laws, policy domains and political systems? (3) How can we explain why some laws are entirely stable over time, while others are constantly adjusted and sometimes transformed fundamentally? The project makes three major contributions. First, it provides an entirely novel conceptual perspective on the design of democratic laws by focusing on two analytical dimensions that are central to any piece of legislation: versatility and precision. This innovative approach allows us, for the first time, to measure and compare the substance of legislative output across and within policy domains, political systems and over time. Second, the project will develop and test an integrated theoretical framework on both the creation and the survival of democratic legislation and thereby advance the theoretical state-of-the-art in comparative public policy. Finally, the project’s ground-breaking methodological approach will pave the way for a computational analysis of legislative content and will thereby push the boundaries of how we study democratic decision-mak",
