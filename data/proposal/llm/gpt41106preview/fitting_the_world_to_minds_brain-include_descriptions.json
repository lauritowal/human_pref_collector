        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a pioneering neuroimaging project designed to forge new connections between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Our objective is to create a detailed neurocognitive model elucidating how individuals develop and share neural representations of their social environment. Traditional neuroscience research has been limited by the use of oversimplified social stimuli; however, our approach leverages recent advancements in brain signal analysis to investigate social interaction within naturalistic contexts.\n\nOur research will explore the hypothesis that interpersonal understanding is facilitated by the synchronization of brain activities across individuals. Employing cutting-edge signal analysis methodologies, innovative experimental paradigms, and rapid MRI techniques, our study consists of three core investigations: First, we will examine if selective brain circuit synchronization during interactive tasks underpins mutual comprehension. Second, we will determine the correlation between similarity in cognitive processes and the degree of brain activity synchronization among individuals. Lastly, we will assess whether intense emotional experiences amplify this neural concordance and the transfer of information between brains.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include a profound enhancement of the knowledge surrounding the neural dynamics of social interactions. By adopting a naturalistic approach to neuroscience, this project has the potential to incite a substantial shift in the paradigms of social and cognitive neuroscience. The implications of our findings are expected to extend beyond academic boundaries, potentially impacting various applied fields concerned with social cognition and interaction."

Studying how social information is represented similarly across individual brains and how it flows from brain to brain poses huge conceptual and technical challenges for neuroscientists, who have consequently resorted to experiments using simplistic and impoverished social stimuli. However, recent advances in brain signal analysis enable us to study the brain basis of social interaction under naturalistic settings with unparalleled accuracy. This neuroimaging project aims to bridge the gap between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience by building a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The framework relies on testing the assumption that similarities in sensory and higher-order processing across individuals can be quantified by measuring temporal synchronization of their brain activity. We use novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition for testing i) whether selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, ii) whether similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with increasingly synchronous brain activity, and iii) whether intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and flow of information from brain to brain. The results will significantly improve our understanding of the brain dynamics of social interaction, and the proposed naturalistic neuroscience approach and will potentially contribute to a significant paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience.",
