        "Abstract:\n\nThe Knowledge for Use (K4U) project addresses the critical gap between the production of social science research and its application in public policy. Recognizing that research truly benefits society only when its findings are effectively utilized, K4U proposes a transformative framework for harnessing social science in the design and implementation of social policies. This initiative will undertake a rigorous philosophical examination of the mechanisms by which social science functions as a social technology, redefining concepts such as objectivity, deliberation, and the interplay of values at the nexus of science and society.\n\nThe current landscape is dominated by the evidence-based policy movement, which emphasizes the creation of high-quality research. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the methodologies for applying this knowledge within the policy realm. K4U seeks to fill this void by developing a practical, user-oriented understanding of how social science knowledge can be integrated into policy decisions. This understanding will empower stakeholders to assess and weigh various factors such as policy effectiveness, evidence strength, cost-benefit analyses, and social and ethical considerations. \n\nK4U's philosophical approach, inspired by the principles of Karl Popper, posits that science and technology serve as essential tools for addressing societal challenges. This approach promotes a focus on the specific and concrete applications of philosophical constructs within real-world situations. By doing so, K4U will not only demonstrate the tangible impact of philosophy on practice but also pioneer a novel discipline within the field: the philosophy of social technology. This project is poised to reshape the way social science informs policy choices, leading to more effective, predictable, and inclusive social outcomes."

That’s only true if you know what to do with it. When it comes to social policy, we don’t really know how to put our research results to use. K4U aims to remedy this. K4U will construct a radically new picture of how to use social science to build better social policies. This picture will be founded on an ambitious philosophical study of the technology of social science including a thorough reconceptualisation of objectivity, deliberation and the role of values in the science/society interface. Current work, primarily by the evidence-based policy and practice movement, focusses on knowledge production: encouraging high quality studies and vetting them. Little attention goes to knowledge use: How is social science knowledge to be used in policy design and deliberation – how should it be used so that policy outcomes are more effective and more reliably predictable and competing values and points of view are respected in policy choice and implementation? K4U will provide not just a theoretical but a practical understanding— for users: intelligible and practically helpful to those who need to estimate and balance the effectiveness, the evidence, the chances of success, the costs, the benefits, the winners and losers, and the social, moral, political and cultural acceptability of proposed policies. The philosophical approach of K4U is broadly Popperian. It views ‘science and technology as a means of understanding social problems and responding to them’ and it emphasises the concrete and detailed, where the real content of general philosophical concepts and claims is embodied and interrogated. K4U is a showcase for the kind of philosophy that makes a difference to real life -- philosophy for practice. And it will launch an entire new field in philosophy: the philosophy of social technology.",
