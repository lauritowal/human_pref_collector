        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe brain's capacity to represent the external world within working memory (WM) is notably limited, a characteristic that has intrigued researchers and led to the development of various theoretical models. The HOMEOSTASIS project seeks to redefine our understanding of WM by proposing a novel theoretical model that emphasizes the interaction of WM with the external world that is still within view, rather than focusing solely on internal storage of absent information. This approach is based on the principle of perceptual homeostasis, wherein the brain dynamically balances the effortful nature of internal storage with the external sampling of the visual environment.\n\nDespite the traditional emphasis on the maximum capacity of WM, the HOMEOSTASIS project posits that individuals may underutilize this capacity, preferring to rely on the external world due to the costs associated with maintaining internal representations. To test this innovative model, new experimental paradigms will be introduced that examine WM as it functions in conjunction with the physically present environment. Cutting-edge electroencephalographic decoding methods will be utilized to uncover the active content within WM, while virtual reality technology will provide controlled environments of differing reliability and familiarity to further probe WM dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the project will explore the implications of this model in clinical settings by examining patients with specific WM component deficits, and the use of machine learning algorithms to identify biometric signatures in eye movements. The outcomes of the HOMEOSTASIS project promise to revolutionize the diagnosis of WM disorders and enhance our understanding of human interaction with computer-modified virtual realities. This research could yield significant insights into cognitive processes, with potential applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to the design of human-computer interfaces."

WM is therefore generally referred to as a limited-capacity system. This limitation is not a problem in daily life, however, because the external world typically remains available and can be accessed relatively easily. The current dominant theory of WM does not explain how the brain balances between internal storage and external sampling, as this theory exclusively relates to situations in which the remembered information is no longer physically present. The HOMEOSTASIS project is motivated by the idea that WM should be studied in interaction with the world that is still within view. HOMEOSTASIS will develop a new theoretical model of WM based on an internal mental economy: I propose that WM maintains a perceptual homeostasis by dynamically trading the costs of accurate internal storage against external sampling of the external visual world. Whereas current research on WM has a strong focus on its maximum capacity, this capacity may hardly be used as observers prefer to minimize internal storage due to the effortful nature of WM storage. I will rigorously test the modelâ€™s theoretical basis using novel experimental paradigms in which WM is studied in interaction with the physically present environment. To decode the current content of WM, I will adopt state-of-the-art electroencephalographic decoding techniques. To study WM in interaction with worlds of varying reliability and familiarity, I will employ virtual reality technology. Finally, I will investigate patients with restricted deficits to specific components of the model and use machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements. This new model of WM will open a new window to diagnose WM disorders and for understanding how we interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments in an increasingly computer-dominated world.",
