        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe study of multisensory integration (MI)—the brain's ability to combine information from different senses into a single percept—is crucial for understanding how we interact with our environment and for addressing deficits in conditions such as schizophrenia. Despite its significance, the neural underpinnings of MI remain largely unexplored. Our research program aims to fill this gap by investigating the neural and neurochemical foundations of MI, with a focus on the dynamic synchronization of neural populations as a central mechanism.\n\nWe propose a multi-faceted approach, utilizing advanced cognitive neuroscience techniques to examine MI in both healthy individuals and schizophrenia patients, who often exhibit impairments in this area. The program is designed to conduct a series of experiments that probe various cognitive processes involved in multisensory perception. These experiments will employ a combination of human electroencephalography (EEG) to capture the macroscopic signatures of cortical processing, source modeling to pinpoint synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure resting neurotransmitter concentrations in key brain regions.\n\nThrough this innovative approach, we anticipate groundbreaking insights into the neural coordination that underlies MI. Our findings are expected to significantly enhance the understanding of multisensory processes, offering new perspectives and theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the outcomes of this research have the potential to directly impact the development of therapeutic strategies for schizophrenia and other conditions characterized by MI dysfunction."

Why are we better in hearing speech when we see a speaker’s lip movements? These are questions of interest in the emerging field of multisensory integration (MI). Although the scientific study of MI on the behavioral level has existed since psychology became an experimental discipline, little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying MI in the human brain. The application of advanced methods of cognitive neuroscience now allow us to uncover the finer details of how sensory inputs are merged to become coherent multisensory percepts. This is of utmost importance in improving our understanding and treatment of conditions in which multisensory integration is impaired, such as schizophrenia. The main objective of the proposed research program is to examine neural and neurochemical markers of MI and to test a new hypothesis that considers dynamic interplay of synchronized neural populations as a key to multisensory processes. The studies within this program include healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, as a prototype of a mental disorder with deficits in MI. Multisensory processes will be examined in a series of experiments requiring various modes of cognitive processes. Reaching beyond the state-of-the-art, this comprises a combination of human EEG data as a macroscopic measure of cortical processing; source modeling of synchronized EEG activity; and neurochemical markers (magnetic resonance spectroscopy of resting neurotransmitter concentrations in selected brain areas). This research program will potentially lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of MI and will open new horizons in the generation of ideas, approaches, and theories regarding multisensory processes in the human brain.",
