        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"GLOBECOSAL: Negotiating Sanctity in Post-Tridentine Art and Global Catholicism\"**\n\nThis project, GLOBECOSAL, seeks to explore the complex interplay between art and the negotiation of sainthood within the framework of the Roman Catholic Church during the era of Iberian dominance. In particular, it scrutinizes the role of artworks in the canonization processes of Catholic blesseds and saints in the post-Tridentine epoch, against a backdrop of global expansion and ideological conflict. The proposal contemplates the under-researched area of how local communities, especially in regions newly integrated into the Catholic sphere, used art to assert their spiritual presence and engage with the universal Church in their quest for official sanctity recognition.\n\nThe research hypothesizes that the art connected to these sanctification campaigns serves as a lens to understand the dialogues between local identities and the Catholic universalism imposed by the Roman Curia. By examining the production and dissemination of these artworks, GLOBECOSAL aims to unveil the strategies employed by local communities to navigate their position within the global context of Catholicism. The project investigates the movement of artifacts and iconographic motifs across expansive networks, theorizing a 'global market of symbolic values' based on sociological critique.\n\nIntegrating art historical and sociological methodologies, the project intends to contribute to a more holistic understanding of the global dimensions of early modern Catholicism. By focusing on the intersection of art, religion, and colonial expansion, GLOBECOSAL has the potential to offer fresh perspectives on the processes of sanctity negotiation, challenging entrenched views on the intersections of Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. This research promises to 'globalize' the history of art from this period, providing a critical reevaluation of the dynamics between local cultures and the central ecclesiastical authority."

As the cult of the saints was among the key conceptual battlegrounds in the conflict between the Catholic church and the Protestants, in the post-Tridentine period, saints came to fulfill spiritual, ideological and propagandistic purposes. Art history has paid heightened attention to the adherence of artworks to the models of sanctity formulated by the Tridentine church, leading to an overall neglect of competing local constructions of sanctity, a shortfall particularly momentous with regard to blesseds and saints connected in different ways to the process of European expansion, specifically to the Iberian empires. The hypothesis under examination is that the artworks produced in relation to gaining recognition by the Church of saints first venerated in newly Christianized territories reveal an underlying negotiation of the local Catholic communities’ spiritual status within universal Catholicism. As official recognition affirmed the society which had made a saint its own, artworks related to this process served purposes of self-representation within the broader framework of social identity formation. GLOBECOSAL traces the circulation of material objects and iconographies within and between global networks of knowledge transmission, and combines this approach with a hypothetical ‘global market of symbolic values’ developed on the basis of concepts from critical sociology. Investigating the negotiation of sanctity between Rome and geographically distant areas participates in ‘globalizing’ the history of early modern art and is qualified to challenge established perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world at large.",
