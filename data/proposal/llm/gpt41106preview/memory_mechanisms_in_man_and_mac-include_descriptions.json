        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious interdisciplinary project designed to investigate the mechanisms of very long-term sensory memory formation and retrieval in humans by examining and validating ten provocative claims concerning memory persistence, processing, and neural architecture. Central to the study is the exploration of the human capacity to recognize stimuli after decades without reactivation of the memory trace, the linear relationship between exposure frequency and memory strength, and the potential sufficiency of a limited number of exposures to form lifelong memories. \n\nThe project hypothesizes the role of attention-related oscillatory brain activity in efficient memory storage and posits the existence of specialized \"Grandmother Cells\" as well as silent neocortical cells—termed \"Neocortical Dark Matter\"—which may underpin long-term memory storage. Theoretical models suggest that Grandmother Cells could be replicated using simple spiking neural networks featuring Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and competitive inhibitory connections, with binary synaptic weights for sustainable memory maintenance.\n\nFurthermore, the project aims to extend these principles to the realm of artificial systems, proposing that memristor-like devices could harness similar mechanisms to revolutionize existing computing architectures.\n\nTo evaluate these assertions, a multifaceted research methodology will integrate psychological experimentation, neuroscientific imaging (fMRI, EEG, and intracerebral recordings in epileptic patients), computational neural network simulations, and the development of bio-inspired hardware prototypes. This comprehensive approach promises not only to deepen the understanding of human memory but also to inspire technological innovations in artificial memory systems. The anticipated outcomes include groundbreaking insights into the nature of sensory memory and the potential for transformative applications in cognitive computing technology."

We will test these claims with a highly interdisciplinary approach involving psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling and hardware development. Novel experimental paradigms will study the formation and maintenance of very long term sensory memories. They will be combined with imaging techniques including fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients. In parallel, computer simulations using networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will model the experimental results, and develop bio-inspired hardware that mimics the brains memory systems.",
