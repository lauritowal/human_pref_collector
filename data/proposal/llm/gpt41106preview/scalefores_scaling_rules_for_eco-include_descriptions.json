        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the SCALEFORES project, aimed at revolutionizing the mapping of ecosystem services (ES) to enable sustainable management of natural resources. Despite the critical role of ES in human well-being, current mapping efforts are hindered by inadequate data and unreliable proxies, which fail to capture the complex trade-offs and synergies among ES. SCALEFORES confronts this challenge by proposing an innovative methodological framework leveraging the scale-dependency of social and ecological datasets.\n\nThe project's core hypothesis is that by understanding the scale at which relationships between ES and underlying variables such as land cover, soil type, and human population density manifest, we can generate precise maps outlining ES interactions. SCALEFORES will systematically investigate these scale-dependent relationships, utilizing this novel approach to improve the accuracy of ES mapping in unmapped regions.\n\nThe project's methodology will undergo rigorous testing by comparing its outputs against the most comprehensive ES maps currently available in Europe. By aligning with the region's extensive data on ES, SCALEFORES aims to validate its framework and establish a new benchmark for ES mapping practices.\n\nSCALEFORES holds the potential to facilitate a paradigm shift in ES-based landscape management, providing policymakers and stakeholders with the tools necessary to balance ecological sustainability and human development. The successful completion of SCALEFORES would represent a significant leap forward in our capacity to understand and manage the natural systems that are foundational to life on Earth."

However, at present there is little data on the distribution of most services in most places. To date, the discipline of ecosystem service mapping has tried overcome this lack of data by using proxies to map ecosystem services based on our perceived understanding of ecosystem services from small-scale studies. However, the most commonly used proxies have been shown to be inaccurate, particularly for understanding policy-relevant trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The challenge therefore remains - how do we reliably map such relationships between multiple ES, thereby enabling multifunctional, ES-based management of our landscapes? In the SCALEFORES project, I will address this challenge head-on by developing and testing a novel methodological framework that enables the use of existing data to produce accurate maps of the relationships between ES in previously unmapped regions. The overarching idea underpinning SCALEFORES is that we can use information on the scale-dependency of relationships between existing social and ecological datasets (e.g. land cover, soil type, human population density) to create maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The SCALEFORES project will systematically examine the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and the social and ecological variables that underpin them. It will then use this knowledge to enable a step change increase in our ability to accurately map both relationships between ES and the distributions of ecosystem services themselves. The methodology developed in SCALEFORES will be validated against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe, as this is the region with the best data on ecosystem services globally.",
