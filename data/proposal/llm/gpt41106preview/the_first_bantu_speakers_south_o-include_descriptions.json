    "title": "The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa",
    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe expansion of Bantu-speaking peoples across vast regions of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa during the Late Holocene represents a pivotal moment in African history, yet it remains one of the most debated and consequential events with enduring political and cultural implications. The prevailing narrative attributes this widespread dispersal to a singular migratory phenomenon propelled by agricultural practices. However, considerable gaps in our understanding persist regarding the movements, subsistence strategies, and cultural dynamics of these early Bantu communities. \n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious interdisciplinary research project aimed at unraveling the complexities of the Bantu Expansion. The initiative brings together a team of experts in African archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics to probe into the enigmatic history of the initial Bantu-speaking village societies that emerged south of the equatorial rainforest. The proposed fieldwork seeks to explore uncharted archaeological territories in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Angola to pinpoint the chronological and geographical genesis of these early settlements, to illuminate their interactions with indigenous foraging populations, and to decode the material remnants indicative of their presence.\n\nKey to this endeavor is the integration of archaeobotanical and palaeoenvironmental analyses to reconstruct the dietary and ecological contexts of these early villagers. Moreover, the project intends to push the boundaries of historical linguistics by employing innovative methods to reconstruct lexicon, particularly as it pertains to subsistence and land use. Engaging in an interuniversity partnership, the research will synthesize archaeozoological, genetic, and climate data within a phylogenetic framework to offer a comprehensive perspective on the interplay between human migration, language evolution, climate dynamics, and the advent of agriculture in Central Africa. This holistic approach promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into one of Africa's most profound and influential historical phenomena."

It is also one of the most controversial issues in African History that still has political repercussions today. It has sparked debate across the disciplines and far beyond Africanist circles in an attempt to understand how the young Bantu language family (ca. 5000 years) could spread over large parts of Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. This massive dispersal is commonly seen as the result of a single migratory macro-event driven by agriculture, but many questions about the movement and subsistence of ancestral Bantu speakers are still open. They can only be answered through real interdisciplinary collaboration. This project will unite researchers with outstanding expertise in African archaeology, archaeobotany and historical linguistics to form a unique cross-disciplinary team that will shed new light on the first Bantu-speaking village communities south of the rainforest. Fieldwork is planned in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Angola that are terra incognita for archaeologists to determine the timing, location and archaeological signature of the earliest villagers and to establish how they interacted with autochthonous hunter-gatherers. Special attention will be paid to archaeobotanical and palaeoenvironmental data to get an idea of their subsistence, diet and habitat. Historical linguistics will be pushed beyond the boundaries of vocabulary-based phylogenetics and open new pathways in lexical reconstruction, especially regarding subsistence and land use of early Bantu speakers. Through interuniversity collaboration archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental and genetic data and phylogenetic modelling will be brought into the cross-disciplinary approach to acquire a new holistic view on the interconnections between human migration, language spread, climate change and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa.",
