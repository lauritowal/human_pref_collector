        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe PRILA (Prison Accountability and Rights in Law Application) initiative aims to forge the inaugural comprehensive analysis of the lived experiences of accountability, legal compliance, and rights protection within European prison environments. Recognizing the profound power imbalances inherent in penal institutions, PRILA seeks to scrutinize and understand the practical application of public and prison law values that should govern such settings. This project is anchored in the conviction that the fairness and legitimacy of imprisonment are pivotal to justice and the maintenance of order, reflecting key tenets of the European approach to penal policy and law.\n\nCurrent literature on the exertion of penal power often fails to capture the intricate realities of how accountability and adherence to the rule of law are perceived and implemented. PRILA endeavors to fill this gap by documenting the perspectives of prisoners, prison personnel, and staff from oversight bodies on the mechanisms that ensure decisions and actions within prisons are equitable, transparent, consistent, and subject to external scrutiny, all while aligning with human rights principles.\n\nBy interweaving insights from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, PRILA will employ an array of research methodologies, encompassing legal analyses, qualitative interviews, and quantitative assessments. The project will enhance understandings of legitimacy in correctional settings, the judicial oversight of administrative actions, the burdens of incarceration, and the personal experiences of penal power.\n\nMoreover, PRILA will investigate the extent to which accountability frameworks reflect broader penal ideologies and regime types. By examining the practical applications of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, the initiative will refine judicial and legal perspectives, assessing the distinctiveness of European penal practices. Ultimately, PRILA's insights will foster the development of improved penal policies and practices, reinforcing the commitment to upholding the rule of law and prisoners' rights across the continent."

Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context.",
