        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project designed to explore the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adult contemporary culture across diverse global regions. The project transcends traditional Western-centric perspectives, embracing the concept of regions as dynamic contexts where Antiquity is not merely absorbed but actively reinterpreted in response to both regional and global challenges. By conducting comparative studies of varying models of reception in Europe, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and extending into less conventional territories such as Africa and Asia, the project seeks to illuminate the universal appeal of Classical Antiquity.\n\nThe research is particularly timely, given the recent surge of classical motifs in popular culture, including movies, internet phenomena, and computer games. These contemporary manifestations provide a prism through which to examine significant ongoing social, political, and cultural transformations across the globe. The project promises to make a significant scholarly contribution by compiling a comprehensive supra-regional survey of classical references and publishing detailed analyses of key instances of reception.\n\nAdditionally, the project has practical educational and cultural implications. The international research team will develop resources for utilizing ancient myths in educational work with disabled children, thereby fostering inclusion and promoting cultural exchange. This multifaceted approach ensures a broad impact, advancing academic frontiers, enriching educational practices, and deepening cultural understanding. The anticipated outcomes will not only contribute to the academic discourse but also offer tangible benefits for educators and cultural practitioners, enabling them to engage with and reinterpret classical heritage in a contemporary context."

This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients’ identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children’s and young adults’ culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and – a bold but necessary step – in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity – through the reception filter – to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.",
