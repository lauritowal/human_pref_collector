        "**Abstract:**\n\nDespite global initiatives to address the gender pay gap (GPG), women continue to earn significantly less than men, with a 20% disparity worldwide and a 13% gap in Europe. The WAGE project proposes an innovative exploration of the gendered dynamics within collective bargaining processes as a strategic method to mitigate these persistent wage inequalities. Focusing on Germany, Norway, and Sweden—countries with a commitment to addressing the GPG—this research will theorize the role of collective bargaining by examining its historical context, current complexities, and potential future developments.\n\nThe study will particularly dissect sector-specific bargaining in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector, utilizing ethnographic methodologies to yield rich, grounded insights. WAGE aims to achieve three critical objectives: (1) to conduct a comparative historical analysis of collective bargaining and the GPG in the target countries, (2) to expose and scrutinize the everyday practices within collective bargaining that influence wage increments in both sectors, and (3) to delineate and interpret the perceptions and actions of stakeholders regarding wage norms and sectoral gendered wage disparities.\n\nThis project stands to make a pioneering academic contribution by systematically employing qualitative methods to examine the intersection of gendered wage differentials and collective wage negotiation. The findings from WAGE will not only advance scholarly understanding but also inform policy action, fostering tangible progress toward gender wage equity. This research is poised to fill a critical gap in existing literature by providing an inter-sectoral perspective on the relationship between collective bargaining and the GPG, thereby offering a substantive foundation for future efforts to bridge the gender wage divide."

In countries explicitly committed to eliminating the gender pay gap (GPG), such as those in Europe, women still earn, on average, 13% less than men do (Eurostat, 2022). This is regardless of the fact that countries with persistent GPGs have deployed a strategic institutional measure to raise the wage floor of feminised work sectors and reduce the GPG – namely, collective bargaining. The overall aim of WAGE is to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining by investigating the past, the unruly present and the possible future of regulated collective bargaining processes in three key countries: Germany, Norway and Sweden. Moreover, the project’s research design will involve gathering data at the sectoral level of the metal sector and nursing and will use ethnographic research methods. To realise its overall aim, WAGE will accomplish the following three research objectives: 1. Compare and synthesise existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. 2. Uncover and analyse daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male dominated metal sector and the female dominated nursing sector. 3. Document and explain how actors embedded in the male dominated metal and the female dominated nursing sector relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. Given the dearth of scholarship on the relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes from an inter-sectoral angle, this study will be the first to systematically use qualitative methods to explore the economic frontier between sectoral gendered wage differentials and collective wage formation, thereby contributing to the effort to achieve gender equity in practice.",
