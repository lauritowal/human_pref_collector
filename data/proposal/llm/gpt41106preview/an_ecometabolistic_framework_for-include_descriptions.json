        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative interdisciplinary project that seeks to revolutionize sustainable building practices through the exploration of bio-based materials. Current architectural methods are hindered by an entrenched reliance on traditional materials, which are becoming increasingly unsustainable due to material depletion. This project contends that the reluctance to adopt bio-based materials stems from challenges in representing and conceptualizing their unique properties such as heterogeneity, variability, and shorter lifespans.\n\nThe project proposes a novel eco-metabolistic framework that integrates carbon-neutrality, renewability, and material optimization, fundamentally redefining the value proposition of architecture. To operationalize this paradigm shift, the research employs a design-by-research methodology, scrutinizing three specific bio-based materials: glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. These materials will be the subject of advanced computational modelling networks focusing on predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing, enabling a comprehensive understanding and application of bio-based materials in architecture.\n\nIn challenging the notion that design agency ends upon building completion, the project advocates for a dynamic model of continual construction. By embracing the transient nature of bio-based materials, the research aims to establish new participatory practices that align with sustainable, socially responsible, and democratic production models. The envisioned outcome is a transformative approach to building, where structures are not static, but evolve through ongoing interactions, maintenance, and interventions, aligning with a more sustainable and adaptable future."

Despite well-organised calls for action maturing into legislation and an attentive profession, architecture is proving reticent in this transition. Bio-based materials are fundamentally different to current building materials being characterised by their complex heterogeneity, unpredictable behaviours and limited lifespans. This project identifies that the key impediments to this transition lie with architectureâ€™s inability to represent, conceptualise and operationalise bio-based materials. It argues that to design with bio-based materials we must challenge the fundamental value proposition of architecture and expand our conception of material lifespan to find new practices of construction. It proposes a holistic eco-metabolistic framework, that allows for carbon-neutral, renewable and materially optimised design solutions. It employs a research-by-design method to investigate three bio-based material perspectives (glulam, bio-polymer composites and bioluminescent bacteria) and instrumentalises them through three advanced computational modelling networks for the predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication and environmental sensing of bio-based materials. It challenges our preconception of design agency as restricted to the traditional cut-off point of building completion, proposing new participatory practices of continual construction to recast the short lifespans of bio-based materials as effective properties of a new sustainable practice. By enabling us to think of buildings as co-present and actively engaged through processes of maintenance and intervention, the project responds to the search for sustainable, more socially conscious and more democratic models of production.",
