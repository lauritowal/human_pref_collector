        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces METABODY, an innovative research project aimed at redefining the understanding of body image in the context of modern society's increasing capacity for bodily appearance manipulation. In an era where control over one's physical form can be exerted through diet, digital alterations, and surgical modifications, the balance between personal identity invariance and invention is more relevant than ever. METABODY seeks to investigate this balance through the groundbreaking concept of Body Imagining, which posits that body image is a dynamic inference rather than a static representation within the brain. This project will explore how individuals integrate prior beliefs and new information to construct their body image, challenging the current paradigm that body image disturbances are rooted solely in first-order perceptual biases. METABODY will delve into the metacognitive aspects of body image, examining the second-order ability to evaluate the reliability of body perceptions in various contexts.\n\nThe research will be structured around three empirical work-packages, each focusing on a different aspect of body image construction: Body Metacognition, which explores the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives during multisensory perception; Body Mentalizing, which investigates the negotiation between self and social perspectives during interpersonal interactions; and Body Decision Making, which analyzes the integration of current, future, and ideal perspectives when individuals face decisions about body modification with uncertain outcomes. By comprehensively examining these components, METABODY aims to offer novel insights into the complex interplay between the body we have and the body we desire, providing a deeper understanding of identity negotiation in a world where changing the body is presented as a straightforward solution to altering the self."

These proliferating phenomena raise the age-old question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity. Addressing this question in relation to modern body image phenomena requires a radical new way of studying the concept of body image. METABODY proposes the novel concept of Body Imagining to capture the idea that our body image is not a fixed representation in the brain, but rather a dynamic inference based on prior expectations and new information. Studying the balance between prior beliefs and new information could thus hold the key to understanding modern body image phenomena. Moreover, existing studies have failed to investigate the metacognitive level of these inferences. METABODY will test the novel hypothesis that body image disturbances are not the result of biases merely in the 1st order ability to perceive oneâ€™s body, but also in the 2nd order ability to evaluate the reliability of these perceptions in given contexts. Specifically, three empirical work-packages will study how individuals balance their own embodied experience against: (1) external perspectives on the body during multisensory perception (Body Metacognition), (2) social perspectives during interpersonal encounters (Body Mentalizing) and (3) future and ideal body perspectives during decisions about body modification options with uncertain outcome (Body Decision Making). Ultimately, METABODY will address in innovative ways the timely question of how we negotiate the balance between the invariance and invention of our identity in a time when changing the body is offered as an easy way to change the self.",
