        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the varied levels of authority states have ceded to international organizations (IOs) and how these levels have evolved over time. The research will address why certain IOs, such as the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have experienced an increase in their competences, whereas others, like the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO, have seen a consistent level of delegated authority. The central hypothesis is that the degree of institutional empowerment is influenced by temporal factors, the cohesion of member states (principals), and the structure of the delegation contract.\n\nThe research aims to build a multi-disciplinary, theory-driven understanding by incorporating a temporal dimension into the principal-agent model, drawing from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. The methodology will involve a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the institutional empowerment of the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO over a 24-year period (1986-2010). The project will conduct extensive qualitative research, including archival work and elite interviews with officials from both national governments and the IOs in question.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include the development of a comprehensive model of power delegation to IOs, enhanced theoretical knowledge within International Relations, and significant empirical contributions to the understanding of the dynamics of institutional empowerment. The insights gained will provide a deeper understanding of the consequences of power delegation and inform the design and implementation of future international cooperation."

At varying levels states have surrendered some authority to IOs, giving them different levels of institutional empowerment. While in the EU and IMF there has been a steadily extension of their competences, in the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO the degree of delegated authority has remained constant. How can we explain these different degrees of authority granted to IOs and their evolution over time? We argue that institutional empowerment is a function of temporal dynamics, the degree of cohesion among principals, and the institutional design of the delegation contract. On the theoretical side, the aim of the proposed interdisciplinary project is to produce theory-driven knowledge by developing a model of power delegation to IOs that integrates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach. This will be done by resorting to four different disciplines: political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. On the empirical side, the main novelty of the project consists in adopting a comparative research design and a longitudinal perspective. We will analyse the institutional empowerment of four different IOs (EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO) over a period of 26 years (1986-2010). Given the aim and scope of this research, the project is to be regarded as theory-building and hypothesis-testing research. It will be based on extensive qualitative work conducted in the archives of these four IOs as well as on elite interviews with national and international officials. With this project we will gain new insights into the consequences of power delegation to IOs and advance theoretical insights and empirical research in International Relations.",
