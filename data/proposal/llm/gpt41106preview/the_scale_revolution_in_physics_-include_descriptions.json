        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the RESCALE project, an interdisciplinary investigation at the intersection of history, philosophy, and physics. The project challenges the long-standing ideal of a final theory in physics—an all-encompassing framework that describes the universe's fundamental entities and applies universally across all scales. This ideal has historically influenced both the construction of physical theories and philosophical interpretations of the cosmos. However, contemporary physics has deviated from seeking such a theory, focusing instead on the understanding of phenomena at different scales and acknowledging that our most successful theories are scale-dependent.\n\nThe RESCALE project posits that the pursuit of a final theory is no longer a viable interpretative strategy. It aims to demonstrate that modern physics requires a shift in philosophical approach—away from the search for a foundational bedrock—and towards a multi-layered, scale-based conception of the universe. This new approach suggests that the universe is best understood as a complex hierarchy of overlapping layers, each with its own set of physical principles, rather than through a single, scale-transcendent framework.\n\nThrough an integrated historical and philosophical analysis, the RESCALE project will explore how this scale-based practice has emerged in physics, particularly in quantum gravity, and how it necessitates a reevaluation of our world picture. The project will examine the implications of this epistemological shift for central philosophical issues such as representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics. By elucidating how contemporary physics reshapes our conception of the universe, the RESCALE project aims to offer a novel perspective on the structure of scientific theories and the nature of scientific explanation, with broad implications for the philosophy of science and our understanding of the world."

Physicists have used it as a blueprint to construct theories of space, time, matter, and motion that apply in principle everywhere and under any circumstances. Philosophers have used it as a guide to interpret existing theories and depict the entire universe in terms of a bedrock of fundamental entities. Although this ideal still plays an important role today in quantum gravity, the situation has considerably changed since the 1950s. Physicists now widely recognize that our best current theories work only at certain scales, and that this may well be the case for any future empirically successful theory. Physicists also spend most of their time studying systems scale by scale and analyzing how physical effects depend on each other across scales, even in the context of quantum gravity. How should philosophers adjust their interpretative practice if they are to take this new way of doing physics seriously? What kind of world picture would result from this? The RESCALE project contends that the ideal of a final theory no longer provides a sensible interpretative guide, leaving us with no better option but to depict the universe one scale at a time. More precisely, the project will show through an in-depth integrated historical and philosophical study that physicists’ new scale-based theoretical practice leads us to draw a partial picture of the world structured in a complex hierarchy of overlapping layers across scales, which is largely independent of what may lie beyond. Besides disclosing a fundamental epistemological transformation in the recent history of science and showing how it forces us to rescale our world picture, this systematic interdisciplinary study at the crossroads of history, philosophy, and physics will have profound implications for our understanding of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics at the frontiers of science.",
