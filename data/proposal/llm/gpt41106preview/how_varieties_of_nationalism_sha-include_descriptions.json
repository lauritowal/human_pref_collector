        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn an era marked by intensifying political polarization within advanced democracies, the proposed research project, VARNATPOL, seeks to scrutinize the role of nationalism in shaping these widening societal divides. The project departs from conventional wisdom that frames such polarization as stemming from a binary conflict between national and universalist values. Instead, VARNATPOL posits that the true fault lines in electoral politics are not drawn between varying levels of national attachment, but between distinct forms of nationalism.\n\nTo explore this hypothesis, VARNATPOL will undertake a comprehensive investigation into how different conceptions of nationalism correlate with public attitudes, adherence to democratic principles, and partisan identities, as well as their utilization in political mobilization by elites. This inquiry will be structured into three interconnected Work Packages, each with a unique focus to collectively address the overarching research question.\n\nThe first Work Package will dissect novel survey data to discern public perceptions of nationalism and their influence on partisan schisms, incorporating innovative methodologies such as open-ended survey queries to delve deeper into national identity constructs. The second Work Package will delve into the approaches political elites employ to galvanize support by leveraging the varieties of nationalism unearthed in the initial phase. Lastly, the third Work Package will assess the impact of these elite strategies on public opinion and the exacerbation of partisan animosity.\n\nBy adopting a multi-method comparative research design, VARNATPOL aims to challenge prevailing assumptions and illuminate the nuanced ways in which nationalism contributes to electoral polarization. The project's findings promise to enrich academic discourse and inform public debate around the critical issue of societal cohesion in contemporary politics."

Across advanced democracies, concerns over deepening divisions have proliferated in recent years, and national identities have emerged as a prime suspect in driving this polarization. According to the common framework in electoral politics research, this polarization is shaped by a transnational cleavage that has at its core a cultural conflict between national attachments and universalist values. VARNATPOL proposes a different perspective: that the dividing lines structuring our politics are drawn not between those with stronger and weaker national attachments, but rather across groups who subscribe to different varieties of nationalism. To assess how varieties of nationalism shape polarization, VARNATPOL theorizes and empirically investigates how national identities are linked with mass attitudes and commitments to democratic norms, map onto partisan identities, and provide opportunities for political mobilization. VARNATPOLâ€™s theoretical approach calls for a multi-method comparative research design. The first Work Package analyzes novel survey data to investigate how common understandings of nationalism in the public shape partisan divisions, and includes methodological innovations using open-ended survey questions to study national identities. The second Work Package examines how elites differ in their efforts to mobilize support based on appeals to the varieties of nationalism identified in the first Work Package. The third Work Package explores whether elite appeals to national identities shape polarization through their effect on public opinion and partisan hostility. Challenging the common wisdom regarding the ways in which nationalism polarizes the electoral arena, VARNATPOL will contribute not only to academic research but also to public debates about the challenges facing our societies.",
