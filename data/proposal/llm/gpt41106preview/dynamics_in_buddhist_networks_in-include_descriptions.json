        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a groundbreaking framework to explore the historical intricacies of cultural interaction and religious transference in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia, a region spanning from the Taklamakan desert to Northeast China. At the heart of ancient civilizational interplay, this area served as a nexus for the Silk Road, facilitating a rich tapestry of cultural and religious exchanges. Central to this interchange was the propagation of Buddhism, a conduit for the diffusion of cultural elements that transcended ethnic and linguistic barriers, fostering the emergence of localized Buddhist practices. \n\nThe proposed research endeavors to dissect the evolution of these localized forms of Buddhism from the 6th to the 14th centuries, offering a novel trans-regional and trans-cultural perspective on religious transmission within Eastern Central Asian history. The project aims to reconstruct the intricate Buddhist network of this era, delineating its entities and interconnections. By integrating uncharted territories of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into Comparative Religious Studies, this project aspires to create a synergistic narrative that merges disparate academic disciplines—Philology, Art History, Archaeology, Religious Studies—under a cohesive research approach.\n\nThe innovation of this research lies in its systematic examination of the multilayered relationships between trans-regional Buddhist traditions (Chinese, Indian, Tibetan) and local Buddhist cultures (Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, Kitan). Through this investigation, the project will illuminate the dynamic, interconnected fabric of religious exchange in Eastern Central Asia, captured in both its spatial and temporal dimensions. The anticipated outcome is a comprehensive understanding of the region's historical religious landscape, providing invaluable insights into the processes of cultural adaptation and transformation that have shaped the cultural heritage of Eastern Central Asia."

This region was the crossroads of ancient civilisations. Its uniqueness was determined by complex dynamics of religious and cultural exchanges gravitating around an ancient communication artery, known as the Silk Road. Buddhism was one major factor in this exchange; its transfer predetermined the transfer of adjacent aspects of culture. The religious exchange involved a variety of cultures and civilisations, which were modified and shaped by their adoption of Buddhism. This process overrode the ethnic and linguistic boundaries of the Buddhist universe. One specific aspect of this process was the rise of the local forms of Buddhism. This project intends to investigate such Buddhist localisations between the 6th–14th centuries. I will create a new trans-regional and trans-cultural vision of the religious transfer in Eastern Central Asian history and will reconstruct this Buddhist network with its entities and relations. It will incorporate the fascinating, but as yet under-researched field of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into a broader research agenda of Comparative Religious Studies. It will establish a new research approach by bringing together many research fields and agendas (such as Philology, Art History, Archaeology, Religious Studies) into one synthesising narrative based on a unique perspective, in which, religious exchange in Eastern Central Asia will be analysed as a dynamic network emerging in its spatial and temporal aspects. For the first time the multi-layered relationships between the trans-regional Buddhist traditions (Chinese, Indian, Tibetan) and those based on local Buddhist cultures (Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, Kitan) will be explored in a systematic way.",
