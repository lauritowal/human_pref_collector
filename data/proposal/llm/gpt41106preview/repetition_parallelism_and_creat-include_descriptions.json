        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe REPAC project endeavors to advance our comprehension of Ancient Mesopotamia's intellectual heritage by exploring the intricate relationship between textual structure and function within Mesopotamian literature and scholarly works. This research focuses on the systematic use of exact and variant repetition as a primary text-structuring mechanism, revealing its roots in the essential worldview held by the learned scribes of this early civilization. By examining literary, magical, and divinatory texts inscribed in Cuneiform script on clay tablets, dating back to the first millennium BCE, REPAC uncovers the multifaceted roles of repetition in these compositions.\n\nOur analysis extends to various forms of repetitive patterns, such as parallelism, refrains, and ring composition, which manifest across all levels of these scholarly genres. REPAC identifies how separated textual elements are linked through proximity and resemblance, thereby driving poetic innovation, rhetorical power, and argumentative creativity. The project highlights that repetition serves not merely as an aesthetic feature but as a functional tool; in divinatory texts, it fosters analogical understanding of the world, while in literary texts, it explores thematic facets through parallel yet nuanced statements. In magical rituals, the persuasive power of analogies is harnessed through repetition.\n\nREPAC posits that the pervasive nature of textual repetition is underpinned by the scribes' belief in the meaningful, causally effective connections among words, concepts, and objects that share an element of similarity. Addressing the scholarly lacuna, this project represents the first comprehensive effort to interpret this worldview and the significance of analogy in Mesopotamian literary and scholarly methods. The anticipated outcome is a significantly enhanced understanding of the intellectual creativity that flourished in Ancient Mesopotamia."

The project investigates the relationship between textual form and function in Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions. It focuses on exact and variant repetition as a text structuring device and demonstrates that the use of repetition is grounded in a fundamental aspect of the worldview of Mesopotamian learned scribes. REPAC studies literary, magical and mantic texts written on clay tablets inscribed in the Cuneiform script in the Akkadian language dating from the first millennium BCE. Parallelism, refrain, ring composition and similar types of regular, part-repetitive patterning occur on all levels of these erudite textual genres. Textual elements which are separate but yoked together through contiguity and similarity were a major vector for poetic creativity, rhetorical effectiveness and inventiveness in argumentation. Repetition in its various forms was used not only as a means of aesthetic ornamentation. In mantic texts, it opened a way to understand the world through analogical reasoning. Literary texts constructed arguments by elucidating different aspects of their theme through sequences of parallel, but slightly divergent, statements. In magical rituals, repetition was used for magical action through the construction of persuasive analogies. The ubiquity of textual repetition was rooted in the scribes’ belief in the meaningful and causally effective interconnection of words, concepts and things sharing an element of similarity. No sustained effort at understanding this worldview and the importance of analogy as a principle of Mesopotamian literary and scholarly method has ever been made. The project fills this major knowledge gap. It will lead to a significantly improved understanding of the creative effort of Ancient Mesopotamia.",
