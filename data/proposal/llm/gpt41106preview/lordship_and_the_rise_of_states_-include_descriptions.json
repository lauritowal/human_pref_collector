        "Abstract:\n\nThe prevailing narrative of European state formation from 1300 to 1600 emphasizes a centralization of fiscal and military power within emerging states. This project challenges this conventional understanding by proposing an alternative interpretation that posits a symbiotic relationship between centralization and decentralization in the development of the modern state. It posits that the burgeoning states of Western Europe garnered essential support from the established elites through the strategic decentralization of legal authority, essentially creating privately owned seigneuries that functioned as \"states-within-states.\" These entities provided a means for elites to contribute to state-building while maintaining a degree of autonomy.\n\nThis research will conduct a comparative analysis across five distinct regions—Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire—to evaluate the proposed hypothesis. These regions have been carefully selected for their diverse trajectories in state formation, urbanization, rural socio-economic structure, and ideological dissent, thereby providing a comprehensive view of the relationship between princely power and seigneurial elites. The project aims to examine whether the centralization of fiscal and military control was indeed counterbalanced by a confederal governmental organization.\n\nThe expected outcome is an analytical framework that allows for an in-depth understanding of path-dependency in the historical evolution of European polities. This framework will contribute to a reevaluation of the social history of power in Western Europe, presenting a nuanced view that integrates the political histories of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. By offering this methodological innovation, the project seeks to provide a more accurate account of the complex processes that shaped the rise of the modern state, thereby reshaping the scholarly discourse on European state formation."

This period is considered as the key phase in the genesis of the modern state, as various polities now centralized fiscal and military resources under their command. While there is debate whether this was primarily a top-down process carried by princes, or a bottom-up process carried by popular representation, scholars agree that state building was exclusively a process of centralization. This assumption must be questioned, as recent studies have raised awkward questions that cannot be answered by the current paradigm. The research hypothesis is that the emerging states of Western Europe could only acquire sufficient support among established elites if they also decentralized much of their legal authority through a process in which princes created a growing number of privately owned seigneuries as “states-within-states” for the benefit of elites who in return contributed to state building. This project will study the interplay between states and seigneurial elites in five regions – Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc and Warwickshire – to test whether fiscal and military centralization was facilitated by a progressively confederal organization of government. Together, the case studies cover four key variables that shaped the relations between princes and power elites in different combinations all over Europe. It concerns different trajectories in 1) state formation, 2) urbanization, 3) the socio-economic organization of rural society and 4) ideological dissent. As a result, the comparisons between the case studies will yield an analytical framework to chart and to explain path-dependency. The project will put the social history of power in Western Europe on a new, improved footing and provide the methodological innovation that is necessary to integrate the political history of Western Europe between1300-1600 with that of Central- and Eastern Europe.",
