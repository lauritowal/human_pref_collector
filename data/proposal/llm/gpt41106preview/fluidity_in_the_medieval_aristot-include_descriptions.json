        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the Foundations in the Medieval Aristotle (FitMA) project, an ambitious research initiative dedicated to bridging a significant gap in our understanding of the medieval reception of Aristotle's works. Aristotle's contributions have profoundly influenced the realms of philosophy, science, and theology, with an extensive legacy evident in the numerous manuscripts from the late medieval and early modern periods. The pivotal role that Latin translations played in the dissemination and interpretation of Aristotle's ideas during the 12th and 13th centuries is well-documented, yet the nuanced variations and annotations by translators and readers within these manuscripts have been largely overlooked. \n\nFitMA proposes to conduct a comprehensive examination of the textual variance found in the Latin translations of three of Aristotle’s most critical treatises on natural philosophy: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. The project will involve creating state-of-the-art critical editions of these Greek-Latin translations, which are vital for documenting the diverse readings across all manuscript witnesses. These critical editions will serve as a foundation for analyzing the textual fluidity that offers direct evidence of how medieval readers engaged with these newly translated works, which differed significantly from their Greek originals.\n\nThrough meticulous study of the manuscripts' textual alterations, the FitMA project will reveal the complexity of the Latin Aristotle's reception and provide a deeper understanding of the interpretive practices of medieval scholars. The project's innovative approach to the study of textual fluidity will not only enhance the scholarship on Aristotle but also establish a new model for interpreting other medieval translations of philosophical and scientific texts. This grant will enable the FitMA project to shed light on a crucial aspect of pre-modern intellectual history, thereby enriching our comprehension of the cultural and intellectual dynamics of the time."

The understanding of Aristotle’s thought was decisively shaped by Latin translations from the 12th and 13th centuries. Translators’ efforts to preserve the exact phrasing of the texts and readers’ struggles to determine the disturbingly novel meaning lie hidden in modifications and notes in the manuscripts. These have however not received the attention they deserve, leading to a significant gap in our knowledge of the medieval reception of Aristotle. FitMA aims to fill this gap through a comprehensive investigation into the new ways to read the Latin Aristotle, with a ground-breaking focus on the textual variance in the handwritten books that preserve the translations. To realize that goal, FitMA will produce state-of-the-art critical editions of Greek-Latin translations of three of Aristotle’s most influential treatises on natural philosophy: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. Critical editions are the established scholarly means to document the variant readings in all manuscript witnesses of an ancient or medieval text. The study of that variance across versions or textual fluidity provides first-hand evidence how readers were exposed to the recently available translations, which are fundamentally different from their Greek originals. Because every manuscript copy of the Latin Aristotle generates a different state for its medieval reception, which cannot be adequately studied from the Greek text or a modern translation, FitMA will advance the state of the art by uncovering the importance of textual fluidity in the manuscripts of these translations and developing an innovative model of interpretation applicable to other medieval translations of philosophy and science.",
