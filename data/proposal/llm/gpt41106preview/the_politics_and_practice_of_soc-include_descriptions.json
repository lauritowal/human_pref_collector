        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal encompasses an exploratory research project that aims to understand the impact of social media on the dynamics of conflict and peace-building in Africa's most vulnerable regions. As the Internet's reach extends to remote areas, largely facilitated by innovative technologies, there is a critical need to examine the implications of this expansion on regions plagued by weak governance structures and persistent violent conflicts. Central to this investigation is the question of how increased social media access influences the interplay between peace-building initiatives and the perpetuation of violence in conflict-affected communities.\n\nFocusing on Eastern Africa, a region marked by religious and political strife, the project will delve into three core research questions that span different levels of social organization. At the macro level, it will assess the ways in which social media influence the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding. At the meso level, the study will explore the reactions and adaptations of public authorities to social media as tools for either fostering violence or advancing peace. Finally, at the micro level, the research will scrutinize the transformation of individual experiences and engagements with violent conflicts due to social media involvement.\n\nThe project will systematically analyze the role of dangerous speech online, the patterns of affiliation and disengagement with conflict narratives, and the strategies employed by various actors to shape the digital landscape in conflict scenarios. Moreover, it will investigate how governance actors in conflict-affected areas are utilizing social media to achieve their ends. Through this multifaceted approach, the research aims to provide comprehensive insights that will inform strategies for leveraging social media as instruments for peace rather than conflict perpetuation."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",
