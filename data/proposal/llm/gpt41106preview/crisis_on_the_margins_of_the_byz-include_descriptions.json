        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project aimed at deciphering the dynamics of societal sustainability and collapse within ancient complex societies. Utilizing a case study of the Byzantine early Christian settlements in the Negev Desert during the 4th to 7th centuries AD, the research endeavors to uncover the factors that facilitated a remarkable adaptation to and flourishing within a challenging desert landscape, followed by a subsequent abrupt and enigmatic decline. The project's novelty lies in its comprehensive, data-rich methodology, merging archaeological and scientific analyses to scrutinize household structures, waste management, and landscape modifications, alongside the examination of biological, geological, and material remains. Through this multi-disciplinary approach, the study will test various hypotheses concerning potential drivers of societal breakdown, including economic turmoil, environmental stressors, and disease. The insights gleaned hold significant contemporary relevance, as they offer a window into understanding the precarious balance between human innovation, socio-political stability, and environmental stewardship in fragile ecosystemsâ€”a balance that is increasingly under threat in today's rapidly developing and globalizing world. The project promises not only to enrich the historical knowledge base with new high-quality data but also to refine overarching theories regarding the limits of human adaptability and the critical conditions necessary for sustainable societal progress. By illuminating the intersection of human resilience and vulnerability in the face of environmental constraints, the proposed research has the potential to inform current and future strategies for managing societal development in marginal and resource-limited regions worldwide."

The broad aim of the research is to explore contexts of collapse and resilience in an ancient society with high levels of socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity within a resource-limited environment. It focuses on the Byzantine early Christian urban centres of the Negev Desert (4th-7th cent. AD) disclosing both the triumph of human ingenuity in conquering the desert through large-scale human settlement and agricultural development as well as a striking and as yet ambiguous case of wholesale systemic collapse. To test hypotheses regarding social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation due to climatic or anthropogenic causes, and the question of plague the project integrates approaches in the archaeology of households, landscapes and garbage through use of biomolecular, botanical, zoological, geological, chronometric, artifactual and contextual sources of data. Dealing with societal vulnerability in marginal regions is timely and relevant in a world where accelerating development rapidly expands such problems, previously localized, to global levels. Although it is a risky endeavour to engage the record of past societies to inform the present and forecast the future due to the typically underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, this project offers substantial gain to theoretical and empirical research on societal vulnerability in two main avenues: (1) providing an opportunity to critically re-evaluate the current state of knowledge in the field based on an extensive corpus of new, high-quality data and (2) drawing more nuanced and informed broad generalizations regarding limiting states for human ingenuity in reconciling social and economic development with sustainable management of the environment and its resources.",
