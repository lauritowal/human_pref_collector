        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the research project CLIMPLEXITY, which seeks to investigate and understand the challenges of policy integration in the context of the European Union's climate change objectives. Despite the EU's commitment to climate as a horizontal priority, the region is at risk of not meeting its net-zero goal by 2050. This project posits that the proliferation of climate-related policies across various sectors may lead to a 'complexity trap,' where policies lack coherence and inadvertently create barriers to successful climate action. The current research gap is attributed to the absence of both a comprehensive theory on policy integration processes and the methods to study such complexities.\n\nCLIMPLEXITY aims to construct a new theoretical framework that explicates the reasons behind the inadequate coordination of growing policy regimes, considering the power dynamics and cross-sectoral activities of actors involved. The project will employ a novel network method to quantitatively assess the synergies and contradictions among policy instruments and objectives, uncovering patterns of policy (dis)integration and their evolutionary trends. Through simulated policy reforms, CLIMPLEXITY will explore system-level solutions and the roles of political actors in either resolving or exacerbating the policy complexity trap.\n\nThe research will conduct a comparative analysis of the coordination mechanisms used by political actors in the EU and select member states to manage the integration of climate considerations across various policy sectors. Leveraging the principal investigator's expertise in analyzing actor constellations and policy processes, the project will utilize a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods, including process tracing, interviews, surveys, comparative case studies, and advanced network analysis.\n\nUltimately, CLIMPLEXITY aims to provide valuable insights and strategic recommendations to enhance climate policy integration within the EU framework. The project's findings will have significant implications, potentially influencing the broader discourse on policy disintegration and informing strategies across multiple policy domains."

The EU has set climate as a horizontal priority and adopted a multitude of policies across sectors. Yet, the EU is projected to miss its net-zero goal for 2050. Why? I propose an explanation. As climate-related policies proliferate, they do not necessarily add up coherently and pave the way for a complexity trap. However, we do not have a system-level picture of synergistic and contradictory climate-relevant interdependencies between EU policies. Such knowledge would be needed to unpack implementation barriers that hinder success in climate policy. The issue is under-investigated because we lack adequate theories and study methods. CLIMPLEXITY’s goal is to develop a new theory about policy integration processes to explain why growing policy regimes remain poorly coordinated given actors’ constellations of power and cross-sectoral activities. To quantitatively model policy interdependencies, CLIMPLEXITY proposes a network method linking synergistic or contradictory policy instruments and goals. Results will reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, their temporal dynamics and system-level solutions via simulated policy reforms. Do political actors then overcome the policy complexity trap or rather add to it? For the EU and selected members states, CLIMPLEXITY compares the coordination mechanisms political actors use to integrate overarching issues like climate across sectors. Based on my expertise in analysing actor constellations in policy processes, I combine rich qualitative and quantitative methods, including process tracing, interviews, surveys, comparative case studies and advanced network analysis. CLIMPLEXITY will deliver insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU. Given the widely observed phenomenon of policy disintegration, the project’s contribution to advance the debate will reach far beyond climate policy.",
