        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering project aimed at re-evaluating the role of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism in the formation of social knowledge and the emergence of modern social sciences. The study is the first of its kind to delve into these journalistic pieces, commonly known as panoramic literature, for their ethnographic detail and influential connections to contemporary academic debates. Despite their significance, these works have been largely overlooked within the history of social sciences, which this project seeks to rectify. By acknowledging journalism as a critical precursor to academic sociology and anthropology, the research intends to establish a more inclusive historiography that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and challenges Eurocentric narratives.\n\nThe project comprises an interdisciplinary and transnational examination of a corpus that includes social sketches and related knowledge forms from Western Europe, German-speaking regions, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The proposed study will incorporate a blend of anthropological and historiographical methodologies to explore the representational strategies of sociographic journalism, its connection to evolving epistemic views, its role within social and spatial contexts, and its interaction with urbanization, cultural exchange, nation-building, and academic institutionalization.\n\nThe outcomes of this project will be extensive and varied, including a series of scholarly essays, a dedicated conference, a public exhibition, an edited volume, and two monographs, which together will provide a multifaceted understanding of the impact of sociographic journalism on the development of social thought. This research has the potential to transform our appreciation of the interplay between journalism and academic disciplines, offering a nuanced perspective on the history of social science."

It represents the first comprehensive study to investigate pieces of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as formative frames/catalysts of social knowledge and science. These social sketches (often referred to as panoramic literature) provide rich ethnographic micro-analysis and often relate to debates held by statisticians, moralists, folklorists, and ethnologists. However, in the discipline-oriented histories of the social sciences and humanities, journalism has been ignored as a form of knowledge and as a founding genre of modern (disciplinary, academic) social science. By exploring the epistemic significance of sociographic journalism, the project promises to institute a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational historiography of the evolution of social knowledge and to revise mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric tales of the past and present. The project has five kinds of outcome: a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. The corpus comprises social sketches and examples of related knowledge frames (travel accounts, philanthropic reports, caricatures etc.) from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The project develops an innovative mix of anthropological/historiographical approaches to examine (1) the representational techniques of sociographic journalism (e.g., methods of constructing social types, the influence of scientific paradigms); (2) how it connects with epistemic developments (e.g., towards materialist and historicizing conceptions of society); (3) its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects; and (4) how the journalistic sketches are to be situated against processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.",
