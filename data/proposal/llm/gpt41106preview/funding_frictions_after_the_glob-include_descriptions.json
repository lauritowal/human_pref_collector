        "Abstract:\n\nThe recent history of financial crises has brought to light the critical role of funding frictions in the stability of global financial markets. These frictions, which can escalate to the point of causing defaults and systemic instability, remain insufficiently understood despite their proven impact during events such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 market turmoil in March 2020. This project proposes a comprehensive analysis of funding frictions and their implications for key financial entities, including countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. By examining the evolution of funding frictions post-global financial crisis, the research aims to address how these entities' financing conditions have been affected by significant market developments.\n\nThe proposed study will focus on the manifestation of funding frictions, such as elevated external financing costs, reduced debt maturities, and restricted access to credit markets. It will investigate four specific post-crisis shifts, including the upsurge in deficits among developed economies, revisions in Money Market Mutual funds regulation, pension risk transfers to life insurance companies, and the implementation of stringent bank regulations under Basel III. Through this analysis, the project intends to ascertain the impacts of these changes on funding costs and credit market access.\n\nThe findings of this research hold the potential to guide policymakers in crafting informed responses to crises and enable institutions to mitigate funding risks. Additionally, the outcomes will be instrumental for sovereigns in managing growing debt levels and for policymakers to comprehend the ramifications of regulatory amendments. This grant proposal seeks support to explore these critical areas, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the resilience of the financial system and contributing to more stable economic environments."

In extreme situations, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) or the market turmoil in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, funding frictions can lead to the default of otherwise healthy institutions and destabilize the entire financial system. While earlier research (pre-GFC) tends to disregard funding frictions, the enormous risk associated with these market tensions highlights that a deeper understanding of funding frictions is crucial - it can guide policy makers to determine their optimal responses to future crises and help institutions to reduce their funding risk. In this project, I will investigate how funding frictions affect financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. While funding frictions can, in the most extreme cases, lead to the bankruptcy of otherwise healthy entities, they usually first manifest through elevated costs for external financing, shorter debt maturities, or a lack of access to certain credit markets. Focusing on these aspects, I will investigate the following question: How did the market developments since the GFC affect funding frictions for countries, banks, pension funds, and insurance companies? More specifically, I examine four post-crisis changes in financial markets - (i) ballooning deficits in most developed economies, (ii) tighter regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, (iii) pension risk transfers with firms transferring their defined benefit (DB) pension plans to life insurance companies, and (iv) tighter bank regulation (as implemented in the Basel III capital accords) - and study their impact on funding costs and access to credit markets. The results can help sovereigns with managing their increasing debt levels and inform policy makers about the (potentially unintended) consequences of regulatory changes.",
