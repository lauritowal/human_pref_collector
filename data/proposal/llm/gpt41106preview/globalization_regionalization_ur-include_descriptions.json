        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"World Seastems\" project aspires to revolutionize our understanding of the global economy through a maritime lens, tracing back to the earliest records from 1734. Aimed at creating an unprecedented map of maritime flows over nearly three centuries, the project will leverage previously underutilized vessel movement data to construct a dynamic and interactive geomatics visualization platform. This platform will not only depict the evolution of shipping routes but will also incorporate analytical tools to distill complex data into accessible information with applications for both academia and education.\n\nThe project has three primary objectives. Firstly, it proposes to spatially and dynamically represent the flow of maritime traffic, unveiling patterns and trends across three hundred years. This will provide a new dimension to understanding economic geography and the development of trade networks. Secondly, World Seastems will scrutinize the structure of the global maritime network through the lens of graph theory and network analysis. By aligning these findings with historical events such as wars and economic crises, the project will examine the network's resilience and transformation, shedding light on global connectivity, power dynamics, and the integration of regional economies.\n\nLastly, the interplay between maritime transport and urban development stands as a key focus. By incorporating databases detailing urban growth, trade, and socio-economic indicators, the project will offer insights into the co-evolution of port cities and their hinterlands, as well as the synergy between sea and land transportation systems. Collectively, these objectives will not only fill a substantial gap in historical economic geography but also offer a robust framework for future research on global economic systems and their interdependencies."

It will exploit untapped vessel movement data available since 1734, date of the first Lloyd's List register. There are three main goals of the project. First, it aims at mapping for the first time the spatial distribution of almost 300 years of maritime flows in a dynamic and interactive manner. A geomatics visualisation platform will also integrate advanced analytical tools to simplify the pattern of shipping routes and corridors, and to extract meaningful information from the original data, with both scientific and pedagogical outcomes. Second, the project will look at the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links with reference to graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks. The global properties of the network can be compared with general models of networks, while the evolution of macroscopic measures will be explored in relation with wider structural and conjectural changes in the world system (e.g. world wars, revolutions, crises) in terms of network expansion, shrinkage, concentration and polarisation. Internally, the search for coherent substructures (i.e. clusters, communities of ports, Ã©conomies-mondes) will focus on the emergence of world regions and regional integration processes, also as a means revealing spheres of influence of world's main powers. Third, we wish to look at the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development. The evolution of (port) cities and hinterlands as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks are crucial aspects to be explored, benefitting from the integration of other global databases on urban population, trade flows, socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions, etc.",
