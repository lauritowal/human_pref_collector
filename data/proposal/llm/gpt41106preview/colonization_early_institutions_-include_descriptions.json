        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a research project aimed at exploring the emergence of state capacity, democratic frameworks, and political dynasties by utilizing the colonial conquest of Latin America as a pivotal natural experiment. Drawing upon the rich historical canvas of comparative politics and development, the study seeks to unravel the multifaceted influences of colonization that have traditionally been challenging to separate, such as legal origins and human capital contributions.\n\nThe innovative methodological approach proposed here offers four distinct advantages to advance the academic discourse. Firstly, the focus on the early years of Spanish colonization capitalizes on the fact that initial conquistadors had limited knowledge about the territories they were to conquer, thereby providing a quasi-random variation in institutional development. This temporally confined examination allows for a more precise assessment of the colonization's immediate impact.\n\nSecondly, the singular colonial influence of Spain in Latin America mitigates the confounding factors arising from diverse legal traditions that often complicate comparative analysis, presenting a more homogeneous context for study.\n\nThirdly, the utilization of “Capitulaciones”— detailed contracts between the conquerors and the Spanish Crown — alongside other archival documents from the Archivo de Indias, sheds light on the nascent institutions' structures and governance rules. This includes insights into taxation, military organization, and indigenous relations, all of which are pivotal in understanding the foundational dynamics of state capacity and political institutions.\n\nLastly, the availability of these historical documents permits the pinpointing of initial settlement locations at a subnational level, enabling a granular analysis of institutional variation and development.\n\nLeveraging the unique historical documentation in the “Capitulaciones” and the Archivo de Indias, this project promises to significantly contribute to the understanding of state formation, democratic evolution, and the genesis of political dynasties, offering implications for both historical knowledge and contemporary policy considerations."

Much of the recent work on comparative politics and development uses large historical events as fruitful experimentation laboratories. However, the colonial experience looks more similar to a \"bundle treatment\" than a single treatment. It is difficult to disentangle the role of differences in legal origin from the influences of human capital, etc. To try to overcome this problem, past empirical approaches use a variety of methods like case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables. I will try to move one step further in this debate by considering the initial years of the Spanish colonization of Latin America as a natural experiment. My methodological approach has four advantages. First, since I only analyse the initial years of colonization, my empirical strategy is based on the fact that the initial conquerors had no knowledge of the land that they intended to conquer. The second advantage is that, in working with the colonization of Latin America, we only have one colonial power, Spain, which avoids the traditional problems of diversity of legal origins. The third advantage is that the contracts (“Capitulaciones”), that the conquerors signed with the King before embarking to America, and before even knowing anything about the land that he would conquer, and other documents from the Archivo de Indias, provide very rich details on the rules that governed the early institutions (power to tax and rule, the use of military power, the treatment of indigenous groups, etc.). Finally, these documents contain information to locate the initial settlements at the subnational level. The colonization of the Americas and the information contained in the “Capitulaciones” found in the Archivo de Indias provides a unique opportunity to advance the debate on these crucial questions.",
