        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: STUDACT – Student Agency in Global Citizenship Education**\n\nGlobal Citizenship Education (GCE) is an educational paradigm essential for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, focusing on fostering peaceful, tolerant, and inclusive societies. Despite its recognized importance for shaping interactions between indigenous and migrant populations, there is a significant gap in understanding how students, across diverse backgrounds, internalize and apply GCE principles. The STUDACT initiative seeks to address this by placing students at the forefront of research, recognizing them as active agents rather than passive learners in the appropriation of GCE.\n\nThe proposed research aims to systematically investigate the ways in which students from various cultural and geographic contexts perceive, engage with, and integrate GCE into their lives. This study will involve a multinational cohort from six countries—Russia, the United States, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom—selected for their significant exposure to migrant influxes. Through an innovative methodological approach that includes group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis, four distinct work packages will facilitate the articulation of student voices, thereby shaping a more effective and relevant GCE framework.\n\nSTUDACT will rigorously analyze GCE-related policies and curricula across different levels of governance, with the objective of answering four critical questions: (1) How do students from diverse backgrounds conceptualize GCE? (2) In what ways do students appropriate GCE into their daily lives? (3) How do student understandings and appropriations of GCE vary within and between countries, educational systems, and individual characteristics? (4) To what extent are student attitudes towards GCE aligned with the perspectives of international organizations, teacher training programs, curriculum developers, and educators?\n\nBy uncovering the nuanced ways in which GCE is understood and operationalized by the youth, STUDACT will provide an essential baseline for further research and the development of educational strategies that truly align with the aspirations and lived experiences of students, thereby contributing to the realization of GCE's transformative potential by the target year of 2030."

It is claimed to have the potential to transform education systems, empowering learners to build more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies, while fostering mutual understanding, especially in interactions between indigenous and migrant populations. Many education systems now expect students to appropriate GCE in their day-to-day. Extant research has addressed challenges in developing GCE, examining capacity building (teachers’ readiness to teach GCE) or mapping inconsistencies in theoretical approaches. However, with no systematic baseline research to show how GCE is understood and appropriated by students, there is little hope of real progress by 2030. STUDACT starts afresh, hypothesising that students are not mere passive recipients of learning – they differ in their desire to engage with GCE, based on personal traits or context. It will explore and contextualise how students receive, understand and appropriate GCE, treating them as core partners and agentic participants. Data will be collected in Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK – all countries with a high migrant influx. Four work packages give students a voice to develop meaningful GCE, using group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. Policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance will be analysed. STUDACT will answer four questions to ensure a strong foundation for GCE to deliver on its promise of educating the next generation: (1) how do students of different backgrounds understand GCE? (2) how do students appropriate GCE? (3) how do understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems? (4) how are student attitudes aligned with those inferred by international organisations, teacher training programmes, curricula developers, or teachers?",
