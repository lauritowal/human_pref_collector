        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the pressing issue of wage inequality within industrialized countries, with a particular focus on the disparities between firms and the persistent gender wage gap exacerbated by the arrival of children. Through a comprehensive examination of German social security records spanning four decades, complemented by survey and administrative data on firms, this research aims to untangle the complex interplay between market forces, government policies, and firm-level decisions that contribute to these inequalities.\n\nProject A delves into the role of increased product market competition and routine-biased technological change in escalating wage inequality between firms. It explores how these market forces influence firm selection and employment distribution across varying productivity levels, as well as their impact on differential wage growth among firm types.\n\nProject B evaluates the effects of two significant government interventions – the establishment of a minimum wage and alterations in business tax rates – on wage dispersion. This project seeks to understand how these policies affect firm dynamics, including selection processes, reallocation of workers, and differential growth outcomes.\n\nLastly, Project C investigates the potential of firm-provided family-friendly policies, such as flexible working hours and child care facilities, to mitigate gender inequality. It also examines the influence of the firm environment, particularly the presence of co-workers with egalitarian gender attitudes and working mothers, on the return-to-work decisions and subsequent earnings trajectories of mothers post-childbirth.\n\nBy placing firms at the heart of the analysis, this research strives to reveal actionable insights into the mechanisms driving wage inequality and to inform policies that could foster more equitable labor market outcomes."

Furthermore, substantial inequality between men and women persists in all industrialised countries, and a large part of the gender gaps observed today is attributable to the arrival of children. In this proposal, we put firms at the centre of the analysis and ask the following questions: First, which market forces can (partly) explain the increasing wage inequality between firms? Second, how do government policies alter the wage structure? And third, how do firm policies and the firm environment impact on gender inequality? All projects draw on four decades of German social security records comprising the near universe of workers and establishments, which we augment with survey and administrative data on firms. In Project A, we investigate how two important market forces, increased product market competition and routine-biased technological change, contributed to the increasing wage inequality between firms, by changing which firms operate in the market (selection) and how employment is distributed across low and high productivity firms (reallocation), and by differentially affecting wage growth across firm types (differential wage growth). In Project B, we study how two prominent government policies, the introduction of a minimum wage and changes in business tax rates, affect wage dispersion between firms through selection, reallocation and differential growth effects. In Project C, we first analyse whether firm provided family-friendly policies, most notably flexible working times and child care facilities, can be effective at reducing gender inequality. We then investigate how the firm environment, specifically the presence of co-workers who are likely to have a working mother and hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, shapes mothers’ return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.",
