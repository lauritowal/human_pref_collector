        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces SynSig, a pioneering research initiative aimed at unraveling the complex relationship between interpersonal synchrony and mental health. While daily human interactions are fundamental to psychological well-being, the mechanisms by which these relationships influence mental health remain largely unknown. SynSig challenges the generic notion that increased synchrony is universally beneficial, positing instead that individuals possess unique, trait-like synchrony signatures that manifest differently across social partnerships. The project's core hypothesis is that mental health is optimized not through uniform increases in synchrony, but through individual-specific adjustments to each person's synchrony signature.\n\nSynSig's innovative approach will be operationalized through the lens of therapeutic encounters, ideal microcosms of curative interactions. The research will explore the presence of individual-specific synchrony signatures and investigate how personalized modulation of these signatures can convert therapeutic relationships into healing ones. Employing a multimodal array of markers—including motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression data—the project will distinguish between enduring synchrony traits and temporary deviations within dyadic exchanges involving both human and virtual participants.\n\nIn a groundbreaking step, SynSig will develop the first multimodal feedback system designed to detect and adjust moment-to-moment deviations from an individual's synchrony signature. This tool will enable the precise tailoring of interpersonal synchrony, fostering the potential to draw direct causal links between these adjustments and subsequent mental health improvements.\n\nUltimately, SynSig aims to deliver transformative insights into the individualized nature of interpersonal synchrony. By spotlighting the nuanced role of social connections in mental health, SynSig promises to pave the way for more personalized, effective therapeutic interventions."

But how such interactions affect mental health is poorly understood. SynSig suggests that interpersonal synchrony is an individual-specific mechanism underlying curative relationships. It seeks to go beyond the one-size-fits-all “the higher the synchrony the better” theoretical assumption underlying the state of the art research. It is the first to propose that individuals have their own individual-specific trait-like synchrony signature as manifests across interacting partners. It further proposes that to make interactions curative, it is necessary to induce an individual-tailored correction to such a signature. That is, the amount and direction of the changes in synchrony must be guided by the individual’s synchrony signature. To develop an individual-specific understanding of synchrony, SynSig focuses on curative interactions encapsulated in time and space: the therapeutic relationship between the client and therapist. It will investigate the existence of individual-specific synchrony signature and how individual-tailored correction of the signature serves as the mechanism transforming relationships into curative ones. It will implement multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) for disentangling the trait-like synchrony signature and state-like deviations from it, of individuals participating in multiple dyadic interactions with humans and virtual humans. The first multimodal feedback system on momentary deviations from the signature will be developed and used to facilitate individual-tailored changes in synchrony and draw causal inferences between such changes and mental health outcomes. The findings will provide new insights into the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and bring us closer to understanding how human connections affect our mental health.",
