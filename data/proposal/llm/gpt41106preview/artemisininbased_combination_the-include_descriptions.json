        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an anthropological research project aimed at exploring the multifaceted nature of the global pharmaceutical drug market through the lens of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs), the primary treatment for malaria. The project focuses on the impact of globalizing processes on drug supply and demand, public health, and the emergence of drug resistance in two African countries with distinct pharmaceutical systems, Benin and Ghana, as well as in Cambodia, where resistance to ACTs has been documented.\n\nThe interdisciplinary team, led by a principal investigator with a strong background in anthropological methodology and theory, is uniquely positioned to conduct this study. The team will include an epidemiologist to examine the extent of ACT consumption and a sociologist to evaluate local pharmaceutical production and regulation. The research will be divided into six work packages (WPs), each addressing a different aspect of the drug market and its implications for health and policy: WP1 and WP2 will assess formal and informal pharmaceutical supply and drug use; WP3 will study ACT consumption patterns; WP4 will focus on pharmaceutical legislation; WP5 will provide insights into the Asian context; and WP6 will manage the project, disseminate findings, and organize symposiums to foster dialogue on improving pharmaceutical systems in Africa and preventing the spread of drug resistance from Asia.\n\nThe proposal emphasizes capacity building through the training of eight master's students, two doctoral candidates, and one postdoctoral researcher. With established partnerships in Benin and Ghana, the project is well-poised to deliver impactful insights into the complex dynamics of the global drug market. The ultimate goals are to inform the development of more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and to mitigate the spread of ACT resistance, thereby safeguarding the effectiveness of malaria treatment and advancing public health."

With dimensions that are simultaneously scientific, therapeutic, popular and commercial, these drugs are central to various issues. ACTs, the new recommended treatment for malaria in Africa, crystallize these issues and provide a case study to investigate the global drug market. This project proposes to use ACTs as a lens to study the realities affecting this market, both in terms of supply and demand in two African countries where the pharmaceutical systems differ significantly. This will involve analyzing the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana and to study their consequences on public health. To further compare the drug systems and to address the serious issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa, the project also proposes conducting a study on the drug system in Cambodia. The central discipline is anthropology, which is extremely relevant to the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply and to the analysis of drug use (WP1 and WP2). However, since a multidisciplinary approach is advised for drug studies, the PI will work with an epidemiologist who will study the scope of ACT consumption (WP3) and a sociologist specializing in pharmaceutical legislation who will analyze local production and ACT regulations (WP4). Opening into Asia will occur through WP5. A WP6 is devoted to project management, dissemination of results, organizing two symposiums and institutional twofold impacts: (1) to foster reflection so that more efficient pharmaceutical systems are established in Africa, and (2) to provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project includes a substantial training component: 8 master students, 2 PhD and 1 post-doct. The PI’s skills in methodology and theory and the solid partnerships she has developed in Benin and Ghana will support the project’s feasibility.",
