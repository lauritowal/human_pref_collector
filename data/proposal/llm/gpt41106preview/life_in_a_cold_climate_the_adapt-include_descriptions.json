        "Abstract:\n\nThe introduction of agriculture to Europe marked a significant ecological and cultural transformation. This project aims to elucidate how the spread of agriculture, akin to enforced climate change, influenced the adaptation of cereals to new environments. Despite recognizing the ecological pressures on crop development, past research has not effectively measured this impact. Leveraging recent advancements spearheaded by the project director, this study seeks to address the imbalance in our comprehension of the human and environmental factors in Europe's domestication process.\n\nThe project will employ state-of-the-art population genomics techniques to pinpoint selection patterns within barley and wheat genomes since the inception of cereal cultivation in Europe. By integrating ecological modeling, the research will identify loci linked to local environmental adaptations through correlation with ecogeographical variables. The temporal framework for these adaptations will be established using ancient DNA sequencing from archaeobotanical samples and computational methods designed to infer the chronological sequence of genetic changes.\n\nFurthermore, the project will integrate the genetic data on environmental adaptations with archaeological evidence of agricultural spread across Europe. This interdisciplinary approach will shed light on potential pauses in agricultural expansion due to environmental adaptation challenges, aligning them with demographic shifts that suggest regional declines in Neolithic populations potentially linked to crop productivity issues. Additionally, an extensive archaeobotanical database will contribute to understanding the changes in cereal prevalence across different European regions.\n\nBy bridging genetic, ecological, and archaeological data, this research will provide a comprehensive view of the role of environmental adaptation in the success and distribution of early European agriculture. The outcomes are expected to offer a profound insight into the interaction between human innovation and ecological constraints during a pivotal era in human history."

Archaeologists have long recognized that the ecological pressures placed on crops would have had an impact on the spread and subsequent development of agriculture, but previously there has been no means of directly assessing the scale and nature of this impact. Recent work that I have directed has shown how such a study could be carried out, and the purpose of this project is to exploit these breakthroughs with the goal of assessing the influence of environmental adaptation on the spread of agriculture, its adoption as the primary subsistence strategy, and the subsequent establishment of farming in different parts of Europe. This will correct the current imbalance between our understanding of the human and environmental dimensions to the domestication of Europe. I will use methods from population genomics to identify loci within the barley and wheat genomes that have undergone selection since the beginning of cereal cultivation in Europe. I will then use ecological modelling to identify those loci whose patterns of selection are associated with ecogeographical variables and hence represent adaptations to local environmental conditions. I will assign dates to the periods when adaptations occurred by sequencing ancient DNA from archaeobotanical assemblages and by computer methods that enable the temporal order of adaptations to be deduced. I will then synthesise the information on environmental adaptations with dating evidence for the spread of agriculture in Europe, which reveals pauses that might be linked to environmental adaptation, with demographic data that indicate regions where Neolithic populations declined, possibly due to inadequate crop productivity, and with an archaeobotanical database showing changes in the prevalence of individual cereals in different regions.",
