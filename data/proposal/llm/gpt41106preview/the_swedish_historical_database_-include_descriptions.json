        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project aims to construct and disseminate an extensive historical database covering the period 1749-1952 for approximately 2,500 Swedish administrative districts. This unique initiative will provide an unparalleled level of detail, offering yearly disaggregated data on economic, political, demographic, occupational, educational, social, agricultural, and infrastructural parameters. The database's distinctiveness lies in its comprehensive coverage and continuity, leveraging Sweden's exceptional historical record-keeping, which boasts the longest-running and most reliable population and vital statistics globally since 1749.\n\nBy assembling this data, we anticipate generating a panel dataset with up to half a million observations per variable, creating a robust foundation for in-depth analysis of long-term economic growth, structural changes, and development patterns. The granularity of the data allows for precise empirical investigation using methods such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation, enhancing our understanding of historical economic phenomena.\n\nThe feasibility and potential impact of the database have been preliminarily demonstrated in a study exploring the relationship between democracy types and resource redistribution post-democratization. Employing a regression-discontinuity design, the study has shown promising results and is currently under second-round revision at the prestigious journal Econometrica. Following the data collection phase, the project will explore various critical questions concerning economic development and growth, contributing significant insights to the field of economic history. The accessibility of the database will also facilitate research endeavors worldwide, thereby enriching the global academic community's resources."

The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction). The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500×T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size. This paper is currently “revise and resubmit” 2nd round at Econometrica. After collecting the new data, we intend to studying a number of questions related to economic development and growth.",
