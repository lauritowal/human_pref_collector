        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal focuses on advancing our comprehension of the economics inherent to the realm of information services by delving into the strategic interactions among agents within the sphere of production and dissemination of such services. Central to our inquiry are the externalities that significantly influence the domain of information services, attributed to factors such as network externalities, the public good nature of information, and the symbiotic relationship between information services and physical infrastructure. These externalities manifest at both the content and infrastructure levels of the information society.\n\nStructured into four comprehensive segments, this proposal outlines a methodical approach to scrutinize the economics of information services. The initial segment lays the theoretical groundwork by employing innovative methods, including global and coordination games, as well as cutting-edge contract theory, to explore two-sided markets and network dynamics. The second segment focuses on the virtual layer, examining the intricacies of recommendation systems, privacy concerns, and transaction costs in online environments, supported by empirical analysis of e-commerce transactions.\n\nThe third segment shifts attention to the physical layer, tackling issues such as net-neutrality and data pricing through the lens of price theory, while also constructing pioneering dynamic investment models to elucidate the interplay between infrastructure and service innovation. Finally, the proposal aims to arm competition policymakers with robust analytical tools, enabling them to navigate the complexities of two-sided markets effectively.\n\nBy embarking on this multidisciplinary investigation, we anticipate not only to enrich the theoretical landscape but also to provide actionable insights into the governance and economic strategies that underpin the burgeoning information services sector."

In this context, externalities play a key role explored by this proposal. Their increasing prevalence in information services can be traced to three features: - Many information services involve one-sided or two-sided network externalities. - Information is a public good and the production and exchange of information between two parties may affect other parties in a positive or negative manner. - Information services and physical infrastructures are complements. Externalities arise in the two layers of the information society, the content level and the physical infrastructure. The proposal is then organized around four parts: 1. Background theory: two-sided markets, network dynamics, contractual externalities 2. Virtual layer: recommendation systems, privacy, transaction costs 3. Physical layer: pricing , investment 4. Competition policy for two-sided markets The first part consists of the development of relevant theory with original and novel methods including for instance global games, coordination games and recent contract theory. The second part studies specific issues in information services such as the design of search engines and the right to privacy. It also includes empirical investigation of on-line transaction costs using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms. The third part is concerned with the infrastructure. It studies net-neutrality and the prices of data from the perspective of price theory, accounting for the gratuity of some services. It will also develop original dynamic investment models to understand the role of the complementarity between infrastructure and service innovation and the role of legacy. The last part will develop tools for competition policy makers.",
