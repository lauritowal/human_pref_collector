        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses a critical gap in international relations research concerning the differential emergence and influence of normative principles (\"norms\") in world politics, with a particular focus on the area of climate change loss and damage. The project, entitled The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD), proposes to explore why certain justice norms related to climate impacts gain prominence and others do not, amidst the urgent recognition by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of the need to address the irreversible consequences of climate change. \n\nDespite the urgency, the policy domain of loss and damage remains deeply contentious and ill-defined, covering a spectrum of issues from disaster risk reduction and non-economic losses, such as loss of sovereignty, to financial mechanisms and climate-induced migration. The proposed research will utilize an interdisciplinary theoretical framework along with an innovative ethnographic methodology to investigate the processes that govern the acceptance and contestation of norms at different governance levels.\n\nCCLAD aims to reveal the dynamic nature of norm content, contesting the notion that norms are static, by showing how they are, in fact, partially constructed through the practices of policy-making and implementation at both international and national scales. The study will conduct a meticulous examination of the micro-politics at play in the negotiation and execution of loss and damage policies, complemented by comparative research on domestic policy practices across nations.\n\nBy synthesizing insights from international negotiations with national policy practices, the project seeks to demonstrate the interplay between policy actions and the shaping of climate justice norms. Furthermore, CCLAD promises to contribute to the field methodologically by refining the approaches of political ethnography and developing \"practice-tracing\" methods, thus providing new tools for understanding the complex life cycle of norms within the realm of global governance."

Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction; non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty); finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and “practice-tracing” methods.",
