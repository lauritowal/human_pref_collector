        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project SUBSILIENCE aims to investigate the influence of climate on the extinction of Neanderthals and the subsequent expansion of Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) across Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. Recognizing the potential of abrupt climatic shifts to induce drastic ecological changes, this research focuses on the adaptive responses of both human species. The central hypothesis posits that the survival of these populations was contingent upon their subsistence strategies in the face of climatic adversity.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, SUBSILIENCE will conduct a comprehensive study at 20 pivotal archaeological sites throughout southern Europe. Employing zooarchaeological and taphonomic methods, the project will evaluate the behavioural flexibility and resilience of Neanderthals and AMH. A key innovation lies in the reconstruction of local terrestrial climates and environments through stable isotope analysis of animal remains, which promises to enhance the chronological and environmental context of these ancient communities.\n\nFurthermore, the project introduces a pioneering technique to estimate prey abundance and ecosystem carrying capacity, which will shed light on the ecology and hunting practices of prehistoric humans. The anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of subsistence patterns that may have conferred an advantage to AMH, and the degree to which climatic fluctuations contributed to Neanderthal extinction.\n\nThe success of SUBSILIENCE in addressing these pressing questions will not only advance the field of Prehistory but also offer critical insights into human adaptability to climate change, with implications that resonate well beyond the European context."

Abrupt and acute oscillations of climate, as recorded from polar ice sheets, are particularly threatening as they can push ecosystems towards catastrophic outcomes. Under these conditions, the survival of a species critically depends on their adaptive skills. Understanding the exact role that these episodes could have had in the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition is then essential to unravel the real causes of Neanderthal demise and AMH success. To do this, SUBSILIENCE will identify the subsistence strategies adopted by both human species in response to those climatic changes at 20 key archaeological sites located across southern European peninsulas. By applying zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses, the behavioural flexibility and resilience of each human species will be assessed. In addition, to enable effective testing, local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions will be accurately reconstructed using stable isotopes from animals consumed, producing a unique, continuous and properly-dated general environmental framework, improving existing knowledge. Finally, to further explore the problem, an innovative procedure to estimate prey abundance, ecology and human behaviour, involving the estimation of the ecosystem carrying capacity, will be developed. This multidisciplinary and novel approach will provide, for the first time, accurate answers to questions concerning a) which particular subsistence patterns (if any) favoured AMH over Neanderthals while coping with the changing environment and b) the extent to which climatic oscillations affected Neanderthal extinction. In this, it will be of relevance to the study of Prehistory on a pan-European scale.",
