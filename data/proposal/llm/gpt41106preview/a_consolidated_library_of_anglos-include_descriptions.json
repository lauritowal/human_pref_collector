        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the objectives and methodology of the Comprehensive Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry (CLASP), a pioneering digital humanities project aimed at revolutionizing the study of early medieval English literature. CLASP endeavors to curate an interactive, online library of all extant Anglo-Saxon verse, both in Old English and Anglo-Latin, spanning over four centuries (c. 670–1100 CE). This corpus, totaling nearly 60,000 lines of poetry, is unique in that it includes works by over fifty identifiable poets, alongside a wealth of anonymous compositions, with most texts preserved in singular manuscript witnesses.\n\nThe project's innovation lies in its application of TEI P5 XML markup to meticulously catalogue linguistic and literary elements, such as sound patterns, metrical structures, spellings, lexis, syntax, formulas, themes, and genre conventions. This level of granular annotation will enable nuanced detection of stylistic and thematic links within and between the dual-language corpus, offering insights into chains of influence and facilitating a comparative chronology of the texts.\n\nA significant aspect of CLASP is its commitment to utilizing the breadth of digital tools, incorporating audio and visual resources to enhance the accessibility and interpretative potential of this ancient poetry. The platform is designed not only for scholarly research but also to engage a wider audience, inviting novel forms of interaction with these cultural artifacts.\n\nThrough a series of scholarly events and publications, CLASP aims to demonstrate the transformative impact of such a comprehensive, bilingual corpus. By providing unprecedented access to the oldest poetry of England, the project aspires to reshape understanding of Anglo-Saxon literary history and contribute to broader European medieval studies, where the interplay of Latin and vernacular literatures within a Christian framework presents parallel opportunities for discovery and analysis."

CLASP will focus on all surviving verse of Anglo-Saxon England, composed in Old English and Anglo-Latin over a period of over four centuries (c. 670–1100 CE), and produce for the first time an online and interactive consolidated library, marked up through TEI P5 XML to facilitate the identification of idiosyncratic features of sound, metre, spellings, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres across the entire corpus, so forging connections and suggesting more certain chains of influence both within and between the two main literary languages of Anglo-Saxon England. The bilingual corpus comprises almost 60,000 lines of poetry, with about half surviving in each language, and mostly appearing in only a single witness, usually in manuscript. More than fifty named poets are identified, many of them dateable with more or less precision, whose influence on each other can be closely documented, while in the case of anonymous verse, most of which is in Old English, the focus will be on tracing potential influence between texts, to establish a comparative rather than an absolute chronology. CLASP will use the full panoply of digital resources, including sound- and image-files where relevant, to make the oldest surviving poetry in England available to a modern audience for unprecedented kinds of exploration, comprehensive analysis, and interrogation, and in a series of conferences, workshops, and other publications will show the potential of such a comprehensive multilingual corpus to revolutionize perspectives not only on Anglo-Saxon England, but elsewhere in Europe, where Latin and the vernacular likewise co-existed in a Christian context across centuries.",
