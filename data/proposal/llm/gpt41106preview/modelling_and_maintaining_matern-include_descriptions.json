        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe HealthyMom project stands at the forefront of addressing the overlooked issue of mental health consequences following pregnancy loss. Despite the recognition of pregnancy's transformative effect on the female brain, the repercussions of miscarriage or stillbirth on brain plasticity and mental health remain enigmatic. This research initiative aims to elucidate the alterations in brain anatomy and function resultant from the abrupt cessation of pregnancy and to discern the mental health challenges experienced during this period of heightened vulnerability and potential stigmatization.\n\nCapitalizing on a multidisciplinary approach that combines multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, HealthyMom is poised to collect groundbreaking longitudinal data in the aftermath of early miscarriage or stillbirth. The study will involve comprehensive mental health monitoring, hormonal assessments, and repeated brain imaging of participating women. Additionally, whole genome sequencing will be extended to include not only the women but also their partners, thereby investigating the influence of genetic interplay between couples on the women's brain trajectory.\n\nBy integrating in-depth surveys with the genomic data, the project will explore the interconnection between individual brain changes, environmental factors that bolster mental health, and genetic predispositions to mental health disorders. The research will leverage existing large datasets and state-of-the-art computational models to contextualize individual brain imaging findings within population norms.\n\nThrough HealthyMom, we anticipate uncovering the neurogenetic signatures that predispose women to mental health disorders post-pregnancy loss and identifying potential targets for preserving maternal mental well-being. The implications of this research are manifold, promising not only to enhance women's health but also to indirectly benefit the health of future generations by informing preventative and therapeutic strategies."

While we have started to gain insights into how pregnancy shapes the female brain toward motherhood, the impact of the abrupt termination of pregnancy on maternal brain plasticity remains largely unknown. Here, I seek to study traces of unwanted terminated pregnancy following early and late pregnancy loss in the female brain, understanding to what degree motherhood associated changes in brain anatomy and function are formed back when a pregnancy is lost. I aim to identify traces and determinants of afflicted mental health in this period of profound vulnerability and (self-)stigmatization. Leveraging my portfolio of expertise in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, the HealthyMom project will acquire unique longitudinal data of the weeks and months following early miscarriage or stillbirth. Specifically, women will undergo repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessment and a comprehensive monitoring of their mental health. I will perform whole genome sequencing, not only of the women but also of their life partners. Together with detailed surveys, this will allow me to uncover how individual brain trajectories relate to environmental levers for mental health maintenance and to genetic risk factors, including genetic effects of the partners on the women. The project will draw on existing big data and advanced computational modelling techniques to chart individual brain imaging patterns in the context of the population norm. As such, HealthyMom offers unprecedented opportunities to understand female-specific brain dynamics and to reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability as well as targets for maintaining maternal mental health. It has significant implications for womenâ€™s health and (indirectly) the health of future offspring.",
