        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative historical research project entitled MedPlaceboEffect, aimed at exploring the intricate relationships between hope, expectation, belief, trust, and their influence on healing practices in late medieval medicine. Recognizing the contemporary relevance of the placebo effect, the project seeks to investigate how these sensibilities were conceptualized, invoked, and operationalized during the late medieval period, particularly in Southern Europe.\n\nUtilizing a multidimensional approach, the project will dissect the interplay between the intellectual underpinnings, social dynamics, and cultural frameworks that shaped and sustained the medieval interpretation of the placebo effect. By analyzing historical texts, medical practices, and institutional structures, the study aims to unravel the complex mechanisms through which the soul's impact on the body was perceived and harnessed for therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe proposed research will engage with current scholarly debates on the symbolic aspects of therapeutic interventions, placing medieval healing sensibilities in dialogue with modern understandings of the placebo effect. The findings are expected to reveal the depth of medieval engagement with psychological and emotional factors in healing, highlighting the role of the mind and soul as central to medical theory and practice of the era.\n\nBy tracing the lineage of these concepts and their manifestation in medieval healthcare, MedPlaceboEffect will not only enrich our historical knowledge but also provide valuable insights into the contemporary challenges facing medicine. The project ultimately aims to inform present-day discussions on patient trust, the efficacy of medical treatments, and the ethical implications of the placebo phenomenon, thereby contributing to the development of more effective healthcare strategies in the 21st century."

The therapeutic power of these sensibilities is recognized today by the modern clustering concept, placebo effect. This integrative project will identify the intellectual, social, and cultural forces in the medieval past that articulated and applied the idea that health may be improved by evoking certain sensibilities. In a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures of healing activity, I analyze the medieval placebo effect as a paradigmatic attribute of the healing of the period. The project brings into dialogue current debates on the curative role of “symbolic aspects of a therapeutic intervention” with medieval perceptions of the soul’s impact on the body. By so doing it will shed new light on the salient engagement of medieval healing practices with hope, expectations, belief, and trust as critical elements of therapy. It will demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities. It will view the breadth of the engagement with the soul/mind as a formative aspect of healing theory and technique, and will show the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in procuring hope, belief, and trust in late medieval Southern European healing. By looking beyond the term to the components that link the phenomena, this historical project will enable the examination of a health system that is simultaneously alien to and part of the underlying legacy of European medicine and will offer a new path for thinking about these issues, essential for effective healthcare. MedPlaceboEffect will thus lay the groundwork for examining the ways these sensibilities are negotiated in the 21st century as healing practices face substantial challenges such as the growing distrust of medical services, and the increasing difficulty of overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research.",
