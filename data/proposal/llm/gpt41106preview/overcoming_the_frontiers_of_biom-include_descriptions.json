        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe BACKWARD project aims to resolve long-standing questions in the phylogeny of African and Asian extinct hominids by advancing palaeoproteomic methodologies. Ancient DNA has significantly enriched our understanding of human evolution, but its retrieval is limited to specimens not older than approximately 400,000 years. In contrast, ancient proteins can be analyzed from remains several millions of years old, providing opportunities to reconstruct evolutionary histories beyond the reach of aDNA.\n\nUtilizing cutting-edge mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, BACKWARD will develop novel palaeoproteomic workflows to investigate two key research areas: the phylogenetic relationships among early South African hominins and the diverse hominid species that once inhabited Southeast Asia. These regions are the center of heated scholarly debate, especially in light of recent discoveries that challenge existing models.\n\nThe project will also pioneer the screening of isolated fossil fragments, typically uninformative in morphology, to determine their species and sex, thereby unveiling critical data from previously inaccessible materials. The results have the potential to redefine our understanding of hominid evolution, particularly the processes that led to human brain development.\n\nMoreover, BACKWARD will explore commercial applications of these innovations, enhancing analytical capabilities in forensic medicine, food, and pharmaceutical industries. A collaborative effort among leading institutions will ensure the integration of diverse expertise, fostering a transformative impact on multiple scientific disciplines akin to the revolution instigated by aDNA research in recent decades. This grant proposal seeks support to propel palaeoproteomics to the forefront of evolutionary biology and beyond."

Ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing revolutionised our knowledge on evolution, migration and admixture of archaic and anatomically modern humans. However, no hominid aDNA older than ~0.4 million years has been retrieved yet. Ancient proteins instead survive much longer than aDNA, enabling molecular-based phylogeny beyond the limits of aDNA degradation. Recently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based ancient protein sequencing, i.e. palaeoproteomics, convincingly demonstrated its transformative value, enabling molecular-based evolutionary reconstructions for species that went extinct millions of years ago. BACKWARD will use palaeoproteomics to address: (i) the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins, and (ii) the hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia; two topics debated for generations, and further complicated by recent finds. This knowledge will also provide the evolutionary scaffolding needed to correctly identify and correlate the series of processes that defined human brain expansion and reorganization. BACKWARD will also screen large sets of morphologically non-informative isolated fossil fragments of bones and teeth, to identify the species and sex of the organism from which they originated. Some of these solutions will be commercially re-purposed to deliver superior performance in public and private analytic laboratories for diagnostics in forensic medicine, and in the food or pharmaceutical industry. As a key BACKWARD feature, the unique contribution provided by each participating institution will be integrated in a strong partnership to transform palaeoanthropology, palaeontology, palaeoecology and archaeology once again, as aDNA did over the last twenty years.",
