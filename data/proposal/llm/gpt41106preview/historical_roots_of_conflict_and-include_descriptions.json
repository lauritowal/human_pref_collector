        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project aimed at exploring the intricate relationship between historical events, institutional development, and economic outcomes in Latin America. The study leverages unique administrative data on early Spanish colonizers to examine the roles that human capital and institutions have played in shaping long-term patterns of economic development and conflict. The first phase of the project delves into the variations in institutional frameworks and personal attributes of settlers from 1492 to 1599, providing a within-country analysis that uncovers the impacts of initial colonization choices on subsequent economic trajectories and disputes. By scrutinizing the heterogeneity of early colonial institutions and their interactions with the settlers' human capital, the research seeks to advance the debate on institutional endogeneity and its consequences for economic performance.\n\nFurthermore, the project intends to uncover the links between contemporary conflicts and historical confrontations by constructing a novel dataset based on archaeological findings. This dataset will pinpoint the locations of ancient conflicts, enabling a longitudinal study of regional conflict dynamics over an extended period. Through this two-pronged approach, the research aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of how past events continue to influence present-day institutional stability and economic prosperity. By shedding light on the roots of institutional persistence and the enduring impact of historical conflicts, the findings are expected to provide valuable insights for policymakers and scholars interested in the nexus between history, institutions, and economic development."

Following the lead of the new institutional economics, part of the literature argues that institutions cause differences in productivity and factor endowments which, in turn, explain economic development. An alternative view assumes that human capital shapes institutional changes and, therefore, institutions are endogenous. In the first part of the project, which is the core of the research proposal, I will try to move one step further in this debate by taking an approach that uses administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The data contain some personal characteristics on each of the settlers from 1492 to 1599 (town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, city of arrival in the Americas, etc). Using within-country analysis, since we have information on the precise destinations of the first “pobladores” (settlers), and the different institutional set-ups during the first years of colonization for different geographical areas in Latin America, I will reexamine the issue of institutions versus human capital in the explanation of economic development and conflict. The institutions in the initial times of colonization were not the same in all the regions of Latin America and, in many cases, represented an evolution of pre-Colombian institutions. The new data allows also the analysis of the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial times. In addition the migrations and the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization provide also some guidance for the research on the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part I plan to go further back in time to understand how very old conflicts influence current conflict. I will construct a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the dynamics of conflict by regions in the very long run.",
