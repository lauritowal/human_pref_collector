        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research aims to elucidate the role of gamma oscillations (30-80Hz) in cortical processes, particularly during active wakefulness and visual perception. Despite gamma waves' established importance in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, their specific function in information transmission and their encoding capacities remain controversial. This proposal builds upon a novel theoretical framework that inverts traditional predictive coding assumptions, positing that gamma waves reflect the congruence between top-down predictions and sensory inputs rather than prediction errors. The project's objective is to empirically test this groundbreaking hypothesis and explore the implications of gamma synchronization in visual cortex columns predicting each other's input.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the research will leverage cutting-edge deep learning networks designed to quantify predictions and prediction errors within natural vision contexts. Advanced multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in both marmosets and humans (via MEG) will be conducted to investigate whether predictability dictates the pattern and synchronization of gamma waves across the cortex. Additionally, the research will examine the influence of experience and perceptual learning on gamma oscillations, positing that exposure to visual stimuli and the consequent learning processes shape gamma wave manifestation.\n\nAn innovative optogenetics approach in marmosets will be employed to determine causality between gamma oscillations and perceptual learning. This will complement the hypothesis that primary visual cortex (V1) gamma waves are contingent on top-down feedback mechanisms. The anticipated outcome of this research is the substantiation of a novel, cohesive theory regarding gamma waves' contribution to the synthesis of sensory evidence and predictive models, offering significant insights into the neural underpinnings of cognitive function and potential interventions for neuropsychiatric conditions."

These waves are believed to be essential for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Their impairment is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, it remains heavily debated what gamma waves encode, and what their precise role in information transmission is. I have recently proposed a new theory about gamma in visual cortex, building on the predictive coding theory. The predictive coding theory holds that the brain makes active top-down predictions about its own sensory inputs. By comparing these, it generates bottom-up prediction errors to drive learning and the updating of priors. The standard view in predictive coding theories is that gamma waves carry prediction errors. However, I recently hypothesized the opposite: 1) Gamma waves signal a match between predictions and sensory inputs (i.e. predictability), and 2) Columns that predict each other's visual input engage in long-range gamma-synchronization. To test this hypothesis, it is critical to develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in the context of natural vision. I will solve this by using recently developed deep-learning networks for prediction. By making multi-areal recordings from visual cortex in marmosets and humans (MEG), I will test if predictability indeed determines gamma waves and their synchronization pattern across space. Because stimulus priors have to be acquired through learning, I will further determine whether gamma waves depend on experience and perceptual learning. In marmosets, I will develop an optogenetics approach to test whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning, and test the prediction that V1 gamma waves depend on top-down feedback. In sum, I expect to provide evidence for a new, unified theory about the role of gamma waves in information transmission and the integration of sensory evidence with predictions.",
