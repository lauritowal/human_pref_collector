        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn response to the UN's declaration of 2020-2030 as the Decade of Action, with a primary focus on combating violent extremism, this proposal seeks funding to address critical gaps in the existing body of research on radicalization and deradicalization. Recognizing the theoretical, empirical, and methodological deficiencies that have hindered progress, our project aims to develop and empirically validate a groundbreaking multi-theoretical framework that elucidates the nature and mechanisms of radicalization leading to violence and subsequent deradicalization processes.\n\nThe first work package (WP1) will establish a robust multi-theory model to capture the complex dynamics of radicalization and deradicalization. In WP2, we will pioneer an innovative methodology and data collection platform, employing dynamic and interactive measures to quantify these phenomena across large samples on five continents. WP3 is dedicated to the investigation of radicalization mechanisms, both within the general populace and inside prisons, across ten diverse nations (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan). This will involve a combination of in-depth interviews and cross-sectional as well as longitudinal online experiments designed to deduce causality. Lastly, WP4 will translate findings into actionable interventions, focusing on the creation of evidence-based prevention programs targeting radicalization in prisons and effective de-radicalization strategies for incarcerated extremists.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this comprehensive framework are twofold: it promises to substantially advance the scientific understanding of violent extremism through unparalleled empirical data gathered from global samples of violent extremists; and it will yield innovative, evidence-based methodologies and interventions for predicting, preventing, and countering violent extremism, thus contributing to the Decade of Action's overarching goal."

This call is grounded in the insufficient progress achieved despite the vast efforts from Governments and scholars to tackle this issue. The main shortcomings of previous approaches are (1) theoretical (poor consensus about the nature and causes), (2) empirical (infrequent access to populations of interest), and (3) methodological (research designs that do not allow to test for causality, no comparative studies, over-reliance on qualitative data). I am going to introduce and test empirically the first comprehensive multi-theoretical framework for the study of radicalization leading to violence and deradicalization by understanding its nature to develop intervention programs. In part one (WP1) I will develop a multi-theory model for the nature and mechanisms underlying radicalization leading to violence and deradicalization. In WP2 I will develop an innovative methodology to assess these processes by a platform for data collection including dynamic and interactive measures of radicalization and deradicalization in large samples in five continents. WP3 will examine the mechanisms underlying radicalization outside and inside prisons in 10 nations (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan) through interviews, combined with online cross-sectional and longitudinal experiments to allow the inference of causality. WP4 will focus on the development of evidence-based programs designed to prevent radicalization in prisons and to conduct de-radicalization with incarcerated violent extremist offenders. The contributions of this framework are twofold: a) advancing the scientific understanding of violent extremism by collecting unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders collected worldwide, and b) providing novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism.",
