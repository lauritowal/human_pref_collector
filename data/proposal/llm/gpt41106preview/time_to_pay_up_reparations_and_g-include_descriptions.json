        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe quest for reparations is gaining momentum across the globe, with marginalized communities and nations of the Global South advocating for redress of historical and contemporary injustices. These calls encompass demands for apologies, recognition of harms through symbolic and institutional reforms, and, notably, financial compensation. The proposed research project, REPAIR, seeks to examine these burgeoning demands for reparations within the context of global development challenges, including environmental degradation, climate change, public health crises, terrorist attacks, and violations of minority rights. By conducting a comparative analysis of reparations related to these issues, REPAIR aims to achieve three primary research objectives: (1) to evaluate the processes of establishment, implementation, and reception of reparations payments; (2) to extract lessons regarding the role of reparations in development from economic, moral, and political viewpoints; and (3) to determine the nature of wealth transfers through reparations, thereby shedding light on the reparative dimensions of economic transactions.\n\nREPAIR stands out as the inaugural comparative social science investigation into reparations within the development sector, expanding the scope of analysis beyond individual case studies. The project is pioneering in its application of economic anthropology theories and methodologies to scrutinize reparations, poised to deliver novel insights into their sociocultural implications and impacts. By exploring the concept of reparations as a mechanism for wealth transfer and probing the reparative facets of economic activities, REPAIR aspires to advance our comprehension of economic life at large. The anticipated findings of this research have the potential to significantly influence policy debates and contribute to a deeper understanding of economic reparations as a tool for justice and development."

Disenfranchised groups from around the world and countries from the Global South increasingly call for reparations. They ask for apologies for past harm, symbolic and institutional measures that recognize and prevent such harm, and – most controversially – for monetary payments. Reparations are meant to respond to environmental pollution, mitigate the worst effects of climate change, compensate for infectious disease outbreaks and terrorist attacks, and bring some degree of justice for indigenous peoples and other minorities. REPAIR studies these new calls for reparations that address different global development challenges. It compares reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. The project’s research objectives are: 1. Compare how reparations payments are established, implemented and received as part of addressing these global development challenges 2. Learn what these payments teach us about reparations in development, from an economic, moral and political perspective 3. Identify what kind of wealth transfer reparations constitute, and what this tells us about the “reparative aspects” of economic life more generally. REPAIR is innovative in that it is the first comparative social-science study of reparations in the field of development. It not only analyses a new and important set of reparations cases, but drastically broadens the comparative frame of their study. Moreover, REPAIR is the first research project to use novel theory and methods from economic anthropology to study reparations. This promises relevant new insights into their sociocultural nature and effects. Lastly, by investigating reparations as a form of wealth transfer and focusing on the “reparative aspects” of economic activity, REPAIR hopes to push the boundaries of our understanding of economic life in general.",
