        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the realm of social science research, understanding the dynamics between constructs such as beliefs, values, and perceived threats is paramount, especially when they inform pressing societal issues like climate change opinions, political polarization, and vaccine hesitancy. The proposed project aims to address three significant methodological challenges that currently impede the accurate analysis of large-scale survey data in the exploration of these constructs. The first challenge is the prevalence of measurement error within survey items, which, if uncorrected, results in the underestimation of effects and potentially misguided conclusions. The second challenge arises when analyzing data from multiple groups, such as different countries, where underlying processes influencing the constructs may vary, complicating the interpretation of group-specific regression slopes or random effects. The third challenge is the issue of measurement non-invariance, particularly in cross-cultural research where translation issues can lead to inequivalent construct measurements, threatening the validity of comparative analysis.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the grant proposal introduces an innovative mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework designed to refine the understanding of what drives polarized beliefs and other related constructs. This framework will facilitate the identification of subsets of groups that share common underlying processes by incorporating a clustering algorithm. Moreover, it will integrate flexible measurement models that can account for non-invariance, thus ensuring that clustering and comparisons are based on true process differences rather than measurement artifacts.\n\nThe project will culminate in the development and dissemination of freely available software, providing the wider research community with advanced tools for the rigorous examination of complex social constructs. By enhancing methodological precision, this research has the potential to yield insights that can inform interventions to mitigate the societal threats posed by polarized beliefs."

For example, do values affect climate change beliefs? Do perceived threats predict political beliefs? Do risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation determine vaccine hesitancy? Polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination are a societal threat and it is important to study what drives them. Large-scale survey data is gathered to do so. Using regression to answer the questions ignores that constructs are not directly observable, but measured by survey items containing measurement error (challenge 1). Not correcting for this causes the studied effects to be underestimated and conclusions to be misguided. When many groups are involved - such as many countries in the European Social Survey - the underlying processes likely differ across groups. For example, drivers of climate change beliefs may differ for countries experiencing extreme weather. Group-specific or multilevel analyses result in numerous group-specific regression slopes or random effects, making it hard to find which regression effects are different or similar for which groups (challenge 2). Across many groups, the constructs' measurement is often inequivalent or 'non-invariant', for example, due to translation (challenge 3). A measurement model indicates how items measure a construct and disregarding non-invariance in this model invalidates the comparison of effects among constructs (i.e., one may find differences that are actually due to non-invariance). By tackling challenges 1-3, the proposed mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework provides the tools to break new ground in understanding what drives constructs like polarized beliefs. A clustering finds subsets of groups with common processes. Flexible measurement models account for non-invariance so that the clustering focuses on the processes. I will implement the methods in freely available software.",
