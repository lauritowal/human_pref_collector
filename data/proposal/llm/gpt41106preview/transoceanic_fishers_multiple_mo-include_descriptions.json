    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"TransOcean\" aims to explore the recent trajectory of China’s and Vietnam’s fishing fleets, which have extended their operations beyond the South China Sea to the waters of Africa and Oceania. While prevailing scholarly discourse frames fishers as mere conduits for their nations' geopolitical stratagems, \"TransOcean\" seeks to uncover the genuine dynamics fueling the geographic shift in fishing practices, as well as the overlooked transoceanic linkages between fishers that transcend national and localized maritime zones. The research will investigate the fluid identities and roles of these individuals and groups—ranging from legally recognized fishers to those deemed poachers, traders, or smugglers—and their interactions with African and Pacific counterparts. Utilizing a ground-breaking concept that focuses on relational and evolving patterns of mobility, coupled with thalassographic analysis, the project endeavors to redefine fishers as versatile and migratory maritime participants, leveraging their varied roles, earnings, and networks for transoceanic ventures.\n\n\"TransOcean\" is distinctive in its examination of disparate, interconnected fishing collectives outside conventional territorial or regional confines, emphasizing movements beyond typical sea migration or diasporic dispersal. Rooted in nuanced ethnography, this study will concentrate on Vietnamese and Chinese as well as African and Pacific fishers within key terrestrial hubs, linked by the burgeoning Sino-Vietnamese appetite for illicit seafood. By pioneering a novel theoretical and methodological approach, \"TransOcean\" aspires to provide fresh insights and tools for addressing complex marine challenges that hold considerable implications for both scientific inquiry and policy-making."

Scholarly analysis has largely assumed that fishers are instruments of their states’ geopolitical agendas, responding to regulations and incentives. This both obscures the actual motivations and modalities of fishers’ expansion of their fishing grounds and downplays the transoceanic networks connecting different fishers beyond state territories and localized fishing grounds in past and present. Charting this spike in maritime trespass, TransOcean will analyze and theorize how individuals and groups of fishers move in and out of legal and illegal, state and non-state categories of fisher, poacher, trader and smuggler, and how the emergent mobilities of Asian fishers interact and collide with those of Pacific and African fishers. Deploying the innovative concept of relational and shifting multiple mobilities and employing thalassographic analysis, TransOcean develops a novel theoretical and methodological framework of fishers as mobile maritime actors who exploit their multiple occupations, incomes and networks to pursue transoceanic expansion. TransOcean studies, for the first time, diverse groups of interconnected fishers outside of territorially bounded fisheries and area studies, by analyzing mobilities beyond sea-borne migration or diasporic settlement. Though multi-scalar and globally oriented TransOcean remains firmly rooted in fine-grained ethnography, with a focus on Vietnamese and Chinese and African and Pacific fishers in specific on-shore nodal points, connected by the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. Thus, TransOcean breaks new methodological and theoretical ground for tackling intractable marine problems of significant scientific and policy value.",
