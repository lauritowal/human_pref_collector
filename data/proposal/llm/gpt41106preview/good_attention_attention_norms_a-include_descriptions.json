        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project GOODATTENTION seeks to explore the largely uncharted normative dimensions of attention within the human mind and its societal implications. In an era where attention is constantly vied for by various forces—be it social media, public health concerns, or political discourse—the question of what constitutes 'good attention' becomes increasingly pertinent. Despite its significance, there is a notable absence of philosophical inquiry into the norms that govern attention and the development of a comprehensive framework to assess these norms.\n\nGOODATTENTION proposes an interdisciplinary and groundbreaking study that bridges gaps between the empirical research on attention in psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics, and the philosophical fields of decision theory, epistemology, and ethics. At the heart of this research is the innovative concept of priority structures that organize mental processes, with the project's central hypothesis positing that the key norms of attention revolve around the concept of relevance.\n\nThe project has two primary objectives: to delineate how attention norms are formed within individual psychological processes and within the social sphere, and to critically appraise these norms through their integration into normative philosophy. To achieve these aims, GOODATTENTION will investigate the biological functionality of relevance processing, the influence of social relevance on attention directed by social norms, and the implications of attention norms on decision-making, knowledge acquisition, and ethical judgment.\n\nThe anticipated impact of GOODATTENTION is multifaceted, promising to invigorate philosophical discourse by incorporating attention norms and to inform diverse fields such as evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Furthermore, by elucidating the epistemic role of attention and the ethical considerations surrounding it, GOODATTENTION aims to provide policymakers with a robust analytical framework for addressing attention-related challenges in contemporary society."

Much public discussion about social media, public health, and political debates is focused on versions of this question. What deserves our attention and how we should regulate attention in the face of distraction occupies the debate. What is missing is a philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for thinking about them. This is what GOODATTENTION provides. While entire fields of philosophy investigate the normative assessment of other aspects of the mind, the normative structure of attention remains largely unstudied. In its ground-breaking and interdisciplinary approach GOODATTENTION connects the study of the nature and the causal role of attention in psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics with the philosophical fields of decision theory, epistemology, and ethics. It develops a unified foundation for the study of attention norms by using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind. It aims, first, to understand how attention norms emerge within our individual psychology and in the social domain. And it aims, second, to evaluate attention norms by integrating them into normative philosophy. The project's hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. GOODATTENTION investigates the biological function of relevance processing and the role of social relevance for how attention is guided by social norms. Building on this investigation, GOODATTENTION considers the role of attention norms for relevance in decision making, and in epistemic and ethical considerations. GOODATTENTION will impact these philosophical fields by showing how they can integrate norms of attention. It unifies research in evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Its investigation of the epistemic role of attention and ethical rights and duties regarding attention will provide an analytical framework as input for policy making.",
