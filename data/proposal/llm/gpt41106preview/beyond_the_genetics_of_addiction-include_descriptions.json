        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research aims to dissect the intricate web of genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in substance use and the propensity for abuse. Substance use, involving agents such as nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and caffeine, presents diverse health implications, some deleterious and others potentially beneficial. Previous twin studies have highlighted the involvement of both heritable and environmental influences in substance use behaviors. Building on these findings, the current proposal outlines a multipronged approach to deepen the understanding of these contributions.\n\nThe primary objectives of this research include: (1) delineating the genetic and environmental determinants of substance use through extended twin family designs; (2) identifying genetic variants and networks associated with substance use via DNA-variant data; (3) examining gene expression differences between substance users and non-users through RNA data analysis; (4) discovering biomarkers by comparing biological samples from users and non-users; and (5) elucidating the relationship between substance use and health outcomes by integrating twin-family data with national health records.\n\nCapitalizing on the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR)—which encompasses a rich longitudinal phenotype database and biological samples—this project is poised for success. The principal investigator brings a wealth of experience from a career commencing in 1999, involving data collection, coordination, and analysis within the NTR framework. This expertise, coupled with a team dedicated to gathering additional data, ensures a robust research endeavor.\n\nThe project will utilize large sample sizes and employ advanced analytic techniques to offer novel insights into the complex interplay of genetics and environment in substance use. The outcomes of this research have the potential to inform prevention and intervention strategies, ultimately reducing the health burden associated with substance abuse."

Substance use is common. Substances like nicotine and cannabis have well-known negative health consequences, while alcohol and caffeine use may be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on quantity and frequency of use. Twin studies (including my own) demonstrated that both heritable and environmental factors play a role. My proposal on substance use (nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and caffeine) is organized around several key objectives: 1. To unravel the complex contribution of genetic and environmental factors to substance use by using extended twin family designs; 2. To identify and confirm genes and gene networks involved in substance use by using DNA-variant data; 3. To explore gene expression patterns with RNA data in substance users versus non-users; 4. To investigate biomarkers in substance users versus non-users using blood or urine; 5. To unravel relation between substance use and health by linking twin-family data to national medical databases. To realize these aims I will use the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR); including both the longitudinal phenotype database and the biological samples. I have been involved in data collection, coordination of data collection and analyzing NTR data since 1999. With my comprehensive experience in data collection, data analyses and my knowledge in the field of behavior genetics and addiction research I will be able to successfully lead this cutting-edge project. Additional data crucial for the project will be collected by my team. Large samples will be available for this study and state-of-the art methods will be used to analyze the data. All together, my project will offer powerful approaches to unravel the complex interaction between genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in substance use and the risk for abuse.",
