        "**Abstract:**\n\nOur research project aims to significantly advance the understanding of economic inequality's multi-dimensional nature and its profound impact on the macroeconomy. By delving into \"3D Inequality\" which encompasses Consumption, Income, and Wealth, we intend to utilize groundbreaking microdata that facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the economy at the household level. This approach will enable us to explore the complex interplay between inequality and macroeconomic outcomes, a nexus that remains underexplored due to the limitations of traditional models in capturing household-level disparities.\n\nIn the context of recent theoretical advancements, heterogeneous agent models have emerged, challenging the conventional wisdom derived from representative agent frameworks and reshaping our comprehension of policy implications. These models suggest that inequality is not merely a byproduct of macroeconomic processes but is a key driver that shapes them. Conversely, macroeconomic fluctuations and policy interventions have varying distributional effects on households.\n\nOur project is poised to rigorously test the mechanisms proposed by heterogeneous agent models, thus bridging the gap between theoretical possibilities and empirical realities. By identifying the specific aspects of micro-level heterogeneity that are critical for macroeconomic dynamics, we will contribute to refining models that incorporate such complexities.\n\nThe findings from this research are anticipated to have substantial policy relevance, potentially revolutionizing fiscal and monetary policy interventions. Additionally, by unraveling the determinants of rising inequality, we can provide empirical evidence to inform the ongoing debate and assist policymakers in addressing the challenges posed by economic disparities. This project promises to reshape our understanding of the economy and deliver actionable insights into combating inequality."

We will study inequality and its dynamics along three dimensions: Consumption, Income and Wealth, “3D Inequality.” With novel microdata we can measure the entirety of the economy down to the single household along the 3 dimensions. In macroeconomics, much theoretical progress has been made in understanding when distributions matter for aggregates. Newer heterogeneous agent models deliver strikingly different implications for monetary and fiscal policies than what the traditional representative agent models do, and also allow us to study the distributional implications of different policies across households. In principle, this class of models can incorporate the potentially rich interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy: on the one hand, inequality shapes macroeconomic aggregates; on the other hand, macroeconomic shocks and policies affect inequality. However, absent precise micro-level facts it is difficult to establish which of the potential mechanisms highlighted by these models are the most important in reality. Our empirical efforts will be disciplined by these recent developments in modelling macroeconomic phenomena with microeconomic heterogeneity. Our overarching motivation is to quantify the type of micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory and thereby inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models. The novel insights we aim to provide could lead to substantial improvements in both fiscal and monetary policy tools. Furthermore, a better understanding of the forces behind growing inequality will inform the current debate on this issue and provide important lessons to policy makers who see economic inequality as a problem in itself.",
