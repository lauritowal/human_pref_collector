        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the ECO project, a multidisciplinary research endeavor aimed at understanding the dynamic role of non-human entities in shaping human cultural narratives within Amazonia. Central to the project is the hypothesis that cultural representations of the Amazon—spanning mythology, folklore, music, essays, literature, travel narratives, cinema, and art—give voice to the region's animals and plants, thus influencing human cultural life. The project introduces the novel concept of 'zoophytography,' the inscription of non-human life into cultural media, challenging the anthropocentric paradigm that prioritizes human agency in meaning-making.\n\nThe ECO project will unfold in three interconnected research streams. The first, \"Amazonian Zoophytography,\" will formulate a theoretical framework for zoophytography, drawing from Amazonian thought, Indigenous and riverine epistemologies, as well as Western philosophical traditions. The second stream, \"Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out,\" will concentrate on the explicit expression of animals in Amazonian cultural outputs, investigating their portrayal and significance. The third, \"Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations,\" will delve into the representation of plant life, challenging the notion of vegetation as merely passive entities.\n\nBy employing ecocriticism and archival research methodologies, ECO aspires to contribute substantially to environmental humanities. The project will provide an Amazonian lens to ecocriticism, intersecting with environmental philosophy and post-colonial studies, ultimately enhancing understanding of Amazonian biodiversity. Moreover, ECO will shed light on the intricate interdependencies between humans and non-humans, highlight the urgent issues of environmental degradation in the Amazon, and advocate for more equitable perspectives on the region's fauna and flora. The outcomes of this project promise to offer new insights into the ecological interconnections that are vital for both local and global ecosystems."

The key hypothesis of ECO is that texts (broadly understood to include mythology, folk tales, the lyrics of songs, essays, literature, travel writings, etc.), cinema and art about this area highlight the ways in which non-human beings dynamically shape human cultural life. The project’s main challenge is to resort both to Amazonian thought and to the academic field of ecocriticism to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants. ECO develops the concept of zoophytography to describe the inscription of non-humans in texts, films and artworks, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making. Research stream I. “Amazonian Zoophytography” formulates a definition of this notion and traces its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies and to Western philosophy. Through archival research, ECO will then gather and analyze sources that portray Amazonian animals and plants from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards in two other research streams: II. “Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out” focuses on the articulation of animals in cultural productions about the Amazon; III. “Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations” analyzes plant inscription in texts, cinema and artworks that question the role of vegetal life as a passive form of existence. ECO will make a significant contribution to the environmental humanities, offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy and post-colonial studies. By creating a deeper understanding of conceptions of Amazonian fauna and flora, the project will reveal the interdependence of humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia and uncover more equitable views on animals and plants from the region.",
