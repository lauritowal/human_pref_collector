        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe BEMOTHER project seeks to elucidate the complex biological and psychological adaptations that underpin motherhood, with a focus on the cerebral and behavioral transformations occurring during and after pregnancy. Previous groundbreaking research by our team has demonstrated that pregnancy induces significant and long-lasting reductions in gray matter (GM) volume within the social cognition network of the brain. Building upon these findings, BEMOTHER aims to construct an integrative model to detail the timeline and evolution of these brain changes, their relationship with cognitive and emotional maternal functions, and the impact of environmental and psychological factors on these adaptations.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, BEMOTHER will employ a prospective longitudinal study design, tracking changes across five critical time points: one pre-pregnancy, two during pregnancy, and two following childbirth. This design will capture neuroimaging data, cognitive performance metrics, maternal-infant bonding assessments, theory-of-mind evaluations, psychiatric profiles, and metabolomics biomarkers. The study will involve three distinct cohorts: women experiencing their first pregnancy, women whose same-sex partners are pregnant, and a control group of nulliparous women. \n\nBy integrating our findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, BEMOTHER will provide innovative insights into the maternal brain, offering intermediate longitudinal evaluations and cross-sectional analyses at strategic intervals. This will enable the creation of a dynamic, RDoC-based model that maps the trajectory of maternal brain and behavioral modifications. BEMOTHER's comprehensive approach promises to revolutionize our understanding of maternal adaptations, integrating multiple functional domains and levels of analysis to paint a holistic picture of the journey into motherhood."

We were the first group to find (1, 2) that pregnancy is associated with consistent, pronounced and long-lasting reductions in cerebral gray matter (GM) volume in areas of the social-cognition network. The aim of BEMOTHER is to develop an integrative model of the adaptations for motherhood that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period by: i) establishing when the brain of pregnant women begins to change and how it evolves; ii) characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding and psychiatric measures; iii) assessing the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors in the maternal adaptations, iv) identifying the metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and v) integrating the previous findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework (RDoC) (3). We will use a prospective longitudinal design at 5 time points (1 pre-pregnancy session, 2 intra-pregnancy sessions and 2 postpartum sessions) during which neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral and metabolomics data will be acquired in 3 groups of women: a group of nulliparous women who will be undergoing a full-term pregnancy, another group of nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo a full-term pregnancy, and a group of control nulliparous women. We will provide the longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, but we will also deliver intermediate longitudinal evaluations after the postpartum session, as well as cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session. BEMOTHER is timely and innovative. It adopts the translational RDoC framework in order to provide a pioneering, comprehensive and dynamic characterization of the adaptations for motherhood, addressing the interaction among different functional domains at different levels of analysis.",
