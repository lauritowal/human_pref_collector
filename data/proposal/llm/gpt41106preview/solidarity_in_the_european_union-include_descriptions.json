        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the normative underpinnings of solidarity within the European Union (EU), a core value essential for European integration. The project will critically examine the principles of socioeconomic justice that should govern the EU, interrogating the extent of social justice obligations transcending member state borders. Two primary objectives structure the research: firstly, the formulation of a normative model of solidarity (EUSOL1) tailored to the EU's unique context and historical evolution; and secondly, the application of this model to pivotal EU challenges, such as labor mobility, refugee policy, fiscal transfers, and expansion policies (EUSOL2). This investigation is poised to advance theoretical discussions on EU identity, international justice, and the intersection of factual and normative dimensions within political theory. Furthermore, it aims to provide critical insights into some of the most contentious and urgent debates presently confronting the EU, thereby contributing to a more coherent and just European framework."

Do European citizens have obligations of social justice that cross the borders of member states? If so, what are their grounds? I propose to answer these questions by providing a normative account of one of the fundamental values underpinning European integration, namely solidarity. The project has two main aims. The first is to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity that is responsive to the specific circumstances and history of the European Union (EUSOL1). The second aim is to apply this model to a number of central issues dividing the EU, including the free movement of persons, burden-sharing within the EUâ€™s refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). The project breaks new ground in normative debates on the nature and development of the EU, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory, and addresses some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today.",
