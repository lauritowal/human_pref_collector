        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project, MetCogCon, aimed at exploring the realm of metacognition in relation to our use of concepts. Concepts are the cornerstone of human cognition, serving as the essential tools of thought that allow for complex reasoning and understanding. Despite their significance, the metacognitive processes that inform the reliability and application of these concepts remain largely unexplored. This project seeks to fill this gap by systematically examining how individuals assess the dependability of concepts and the impact this has on cognitive control and decision-making.\n\nThe investigation will delve into why certain concepts, such as GENE, are perceived as more dependable than others, like MEME, and how this influences our acceptance or rejection of them. Such metacognitive judgments are pivotal in both theoretical and practical reasoning, affecting the selection and use of concepts in everyday life and scholarly inquiry. Currently, the lack of a robust theoretical framework hinders progress in understanding these cognitive phenomena, which MetCogCon intends to address.\n\nEmploying a multidisciplinary approach, the research will integrate philosophical analysis with psychological modeling and empirical experimentation. By doing so, the project aims to construct a clearer theoretical model of metacognitive processes relating to concept usage. The findings from MetCogCon have the potential to inform policy on reasoning strategies in various contexts, highlighting when the intuitive cues and heuristics guiding our conceptual choices are reliable. Ultimately, the project's contributions will extend beyond practical applications, shedding light on foundational aspects of human cognitive architecture and resolving complex philosophical issues.\n\nMetCogCon represents a pioneering step towards unraveling the intricate relationship between metacognition and concepts, with the promise of enhancing our understanding of the human mind's extraordinary capabilities."

Concepts lie at the heart of the extraordinary power of the human mind. They are the building blocks of thought, the tools with which we think. Like physical tools, they can be more or less dependable, more or less fit for purpose: e.g. for most people GENE feels like a better concept than MEME. We have an intuitive sense of how dependable a concept is, which is crucial when we decide whether to rely on the concept. It can underpin our decision to reject some concepts (e.g. RACE) and embrace others in our theorising (e.g SPECIES). Similarly in everyday thinking: when concepts are selected for reasoning and induction, and when different cognitive processes compete for control of action, the metacognition that accompanies the concepts involved will have a powerful effect. However, metacognition directed at concepts is still poorly understood. We lack even a clear theoretical framework to underpin research in this area. That is unfortunate because developing an account of peopleâ€™s metacognitive understanding of their concepts is likely to tell us important things about concepts and about cognitive control; and to solve some thorny philosophical problems. MetCogCon takes up that opportunity. The project will be the first systematic investigation of the scope of metacognition as it applies to concepts. We propose to combine the analytic methods developed by philosophers of mind and cognitive science with psychological model-building and experimental investigation. The insights gained in the project could have important implications for policies about how to reason in everyday and in scientific/philosophical contexts, by outlining when the cues and heuristics that underpin our decisions to embrace or reject particular concepts can and cannot be trusted. Most significantly, the project promises to increase our understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind.",
