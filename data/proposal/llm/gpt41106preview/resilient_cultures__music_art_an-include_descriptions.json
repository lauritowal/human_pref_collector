        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the RESCUE project, a rigorous academic study examining the interplay between cultural practices and authoritarian governance in mainland China and Hong Kong. As these regions experience a clampdown on free expression, RESCUE seeks to understand how actors within popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema develop strategies to navigate and articulate social and political dissent. The project aims to theorize the dynamics of resilience and critique amidst growing authoritarianism and the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of digital platforms.\n\nRESCUE will conduct a relational comparative analysis across various cultural fields and localities, including Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui. This will include a focus on indie and folk music scenes, the functioning of art institutes, socially engaged art initiatives, and queer film culture. By employing a mixed-methods approach—incorporating ethnography, textual analysis, digital methodologies, and collaborative research—the project will delve into the varied ways that cultural practitioners negotiate the boundaries of expression and critique.\n\nMoreover, RESCUE is committed to fostering a collaborative network of scholars, creatives, and activists spanning mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe. This network will be energized through workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition, all designed to amplify the project's social impact. The outcomes of RESCUE will challenge prevailing perceptions of a monolithic Chinese state by highlighting the nuanced, resilient, and diverse voices within its cultural landscape. These findings will not only shed light on the specific context of China and Hong Kong but will also resonate with and potentially benefit communities in other regions, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, who are grappling with similar issues of oppression and cultural resistance."

How to speak against power while being silenced? How to stay amidst suppression? RESCUE studies how cultural practices in the domains of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, in mainland China and Hong Kong, develop resilient tactics to express their social and political discontent. It theorises resilience and cultural critique in times of intensified authoritarianism and rapid platformization. Whereas such practices can resort to a history of experiences in China to negotiate a recently intensified authoritarianism, cultural practitioners in Hong Kong are facing a compressed authoritarianism – still searching for resilient tactics. RESCUE studies indie music in Hong Kong; folk music in China; the role of official and unofficial art institutes in China and Hong Kong; socially engaged art projects in rural and urban areas in China and Hong Kong; and queer cinema and queer film festivals in China and Hong Kong. It develops a relational comparative analysis between different cultural fields, and at different localities (Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianshui), to unpack the (im)possibilities of critique. RESCUE develops an innovative methodological toolkit, combining ethnography with textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research. RESCUE will establish and consolidate a network of academics, cultural practitioners, and activists in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, through multiple workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition – thereby increasing the social impact of the project. Findings will not only attest to the multivocality, diversity, and vitality of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, thus pushing back against the idea of the omnipotent Chinese state, but also inspire and forge connections to other localities facing a comparable predicament (e.g. Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey).",
