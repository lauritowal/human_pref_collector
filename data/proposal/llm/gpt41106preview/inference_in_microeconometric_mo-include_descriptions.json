        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal presents a comprehensive research initiative aimed at advancing econometric methods to address unobserved heterogeneity—an integral factor in varying economic outcomes among agents—in economic modeling. The project exploits the rich structure of longitudinal data to develop robust inference methods that can reconcile observed data variability with econometric models. It is structured into three interconnected blocks, each targeting a critical aspect of panel data applications in contemporary economic research.\n\nBlock one focuses on the enhancement of statistical hypothesis tests within nonlinear models, a domain that has been predominantly confined to point estimation. By incorporating statistical inference, researchers will be able to more accurately account for uncertainty in economic data, providing a stronger foundation for testing economic theories.\n\nThe second block addresses the estimation challenges in models for network data. Recognizing the profound impact of social and economic networks, the project seeks to establish formal results by treating network data as a specialized form of panel data, thereby extending the analytical capabilities within this burgeoning field.\n\nBlock three is devoted to the non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models, taking into account unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables. Despite their ubiquity in labor economics and industrial organization, such models currently lack rigorous non-parametric estimation techniques. The proposed methods will be evaluated both theoretically and through simulations to ensure their efficacy.\n\nThe practical applications of these methods are vast and will be demonstrated through empirical studies, including an examination of the factors influencing labor force participation and the behaviors driving the import and export activities of firms and countries. This project promises to significantly enhance the precision and reliability of econometric analyses, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of economic phenomena."

Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in economic modeling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. The aim of this project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three blocks. Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel data. The first block deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second block makes progress on the estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third block uses panel data to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and they will be applied to various empirical problems. Two examples of applications that we will study are the extensive margin of labor force participation and the determinants of the import and export behavior of firms and countries.",
