        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe REDHIS initiative seeks to authoritatively redefine the narrative of Roman legal culture during Late Antiquity by examining its enduring elements of sophistication. This project uniquely investigates two core facets of the era's jurisprudential heritage. First, it undertakes a critical analysis of the manuscript transmission of legal texts, an area previously overlooked, to reveal the sustained engagement with classical jurists' oeuvres in educational and judicial settings. By meticulously cataloging and interpreting the surviving papyri and parchment remnants, the project aims to illuminate how fourth- and fifth-century lawyers remained connected to their historical predecessors' legal accomplishments.\n\nSecond, REDHIS challenges the prevailing notion that Late Antiquity was solely characterized by imperial edicts, contrasting with an era dominated by private juridical scholarship. Through an in-depth examination of imperial motivations, the project proposes to uncover the cognitive processes behind legislative actions, demonstrating continuity with earlier juristic works and a profound interplay between imperial and private legal thought.\n\nThe project will be executed by three interdisciplinary research teams under the principal investigator's stewardship. Their work will include editing a comprehensive collection of papyri and parchments, forming the foundation for a novel interpretive framework. REDHIS is committed to collaborative knowledge exchange, orchestrating workshops with European scholars and culminating in a capstone international conference aimed at broadening scholarly understanding of Late Antique legal culture.\n\nThe deliverables of this project will be substantial, comprising four major scholarly contributions: an anthology of direct juristic writings, a monograph detailing the historical and geographical context of Late Antique legal literature, a critical volume on Emperor Justinian's legislative impact, and the proceedings of the international conference. Through these publications, REDHIS aspires to offer profound insights into the legal tradition of Late Antiquity, fostering a reevaluation of its complexity and cohesiveness within the broader scope of Roman legal history."

The project will focus on the elements which display the persistence of a legal culture of high level. Two are the main aspects that will be researched. First, a comprehensive understanding of legal culture has to include the study of the legal texts’ manuscript transmission. Although in Late Antiquity few works were composed anew, the books of the main classical jurists of previous centuries were copied, read and studied in the school and in the courts. A full appreciation of the remains of such copies in papyri and parchment – which has been neglected here so far – will explain how the lawyers of the 4th and 5th centuries AD kept in touch with the achievements of previous jurists. Secondly, Late Antiquity is considered to be the epoch of the emperors’ legislation, in opposition to the previous epoch dominated by private jurists. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of the motivations of the emperors’ decisions will show the mental proceeding of the lawgivers and, at the same time, will show a deep relationship with the works of the roman jurists. The project will be developed, under the direction of the PI, by three research teams, with a strong cross-disciplinary composition. A wide collection of papyri and parchments will be edited, as a basis for a new interpretation, which will be the second part of the project. REDHIS will organize a series of workshops with the participation of scholars from different European countries. A final international conference on the legal culture in Late Antiquity will disseminate into the scientific community the results of the research. Four publications will be produced: a collection of the jurists' writings that have come down to us in direct tradition, i.e. outside the Digest; a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature; a book on Justinian as a lawgiver; the proceedings of the international conference.",
