        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for GoviB, a pioneering historical research project aimed at profoundly enhancing our understanding of governance in the ancient capital of Babylon. This seminal study targets the transformative period between the late 8th and 4th centuries BC when Babylon underwent significant political and cultural evolution under the successive dominion of three empires: the Assyrian, the Chaldean, and the Persian.\n\nThe primary objective of GoviB is to unravel the complexities of imperial governance, local negotiation, and the dynamic interplay of strategies between rulers and the ruled. Such an understanding will not only shed light on the factors contributing to societal stability or instability but also challenge modern preconceptions of ancient 'oriental' governance systems as being uniformly despotic.\n\nThe research is poised to offer an unprecedented analysis of newly accessible sources, notably the Neo-Babylonian archival texts unearthed during German excavations. These texts represent a significant repository of knowledge that has been made available to GoviB through an exclusive agreement with the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin. \n\nIn addition, GoviB will incorporate a modern conceptual framework from governance studies, which emphasizes the range of actors, interactions, and non-personal factors impacting decision-making processes. This approach promises to redirect the focus from traditional government structures to a broader understanding of governance, thereby offering a fresh perspective on the historical mechanisms at play.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of GoviB will not only contribute to a re-assessment of ancient Near Eastern cultural transformations but also resonate with broader geopolitical inquiries regarding the conditions under which states experience continuity or upheaval, and the mechanisms behind successful or failed regime changes. The project's innovative methodology and use of previously untapped resources stand to position it as a landmark study with implications for both historical scholarship and contemporary governance theory."

Babylonia is the earliest society in the ancient world that produced sufficient indigenous sources that allow studying the transition from a strongly anchored local to a more ‘global’ (imperial), de-nationalized form of governance. From the late 8th to the 4th century BC, Babylon experienced two major regime changes and was consecutively ruled by three empires – the Assyrian, the Chaldean and the (first) Persian. While the regime changes and other events are known as historical facts, little is known about how imperial rule was negotiated locally and how the strategies which rulers and ruled applied in pursuit of their interests interacted and led to instability or stability. The reasons are incomplete historical data, and difficulties to interpret available ambivalent or conflicting data. With GoviB I want to achieve a novel understanding of politics and authority in the ancient city of Babylon, leading to a new balanced evaluation of the role which the empires played in the long-term cultural transformation of the ancient Near East. The results will contribute to a re-evaluation of modern perceptions of ‘oriental’ governance as absolute or ‘despotic’, and to the wider question of what causes states to be stable or instable, and how regime changes fail or succeed. I will achieve these goals by analysing newly available textual and archaeological material: the Neo-Babylonian archival texts from the German excavations in Babylon. The Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin granted me the rights to put this museum treasure trove to use for GoviB. Furthermore, I will apply the conceptual framework of governance studies to the historical evidence. Its heuristic value lies in the fact that it relocates the focus from government to governance, that is, the interdependencies and interactions between actors, and it includes non-personal factors that influenced decision-making.",
