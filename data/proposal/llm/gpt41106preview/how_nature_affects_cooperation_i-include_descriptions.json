        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project, NATCOOP, that seeks to explore the intricate interplay between natural systems and socio-economic behaviors as they pertain to the sustainable management of common-pool resources. The research hypothesizes that the dynamic constraints of nature significantly influence the economic preferences and incentives of individuals, which in turn shape their collective resource management strategies. With a focus on developing countries, where the reliance on shared resources is critical to community survival, the project will examine three key mechanisms: (A) the potential for natural system thresholds to inspire cooperation; (B) the impact of resource volatility on risk tolerance and subsequent community management outcomes; and (C) the role of leadership in conjunction with natural environmental factors in promoting collaborative solutions to resource-use challenges.\n\nNATCOOP represents an ambitious effort to merge economic theory with sustainability science, leveraging case studies from diverse socio-economic and ecological settings across three continents. These empirical investigations will be complemented by theoretical and statistical analyses to uncover novel insights into the feedback loops between natural systems and human cooperation. The project's expansive scope is designed to produce a body of knowledge that offers actionable guidance for the formulation of policies that align natural conditions with social objectives to foster the sustainable exploitation of renewable resources.\n\nThe principal investigator's interdisciplinary expertise in economics and ecology ideally positions them to steer this groundbreaking research. The ultimate aim of NATCOOP is to pinpoint scenarios wherein the environment and society can synergistically work together to ensure the enduring viability of communal resources, thereby contributing to the economic stability and ecological resilience of vulnerable populations worldwide. Through this endeavor, the project promises to redefine our understanding of social-ecological systems and pave the way for more effective resource governance."

This can be taken into account to formulate effective policies. However, the causal pathway from the natural to the social environment and its feedback for sustainable resource use is often overlooked, not the least because preferences and incentives are traditionally viewed as being stable and fixed. Yet, it is high time to take this new perspective: Social-ecological systems around the globe are under mounting stress and common pool resources are vital, in particular in developing countries. This project aims to establish how nature shapes preferences and incentives of economic agents and how this in turn affects common-pool resource management. To this end, I investigate three mechanisms: (A) how tipping points and thresholds in the natural system may encourage cooperation; (B) how the volatility of resource abundance influences risk preferences and how this in turn affects community-based management; and (C) how leadership, which is closely linked to risk preferences, interacts with the natural environment to foster cooperation that overcomes common-pool dilemmas. NATCOOP's bold agenda pushes the frontier of economics and sustainability science. Not only the investigation of the feedbacks between nature and cooperation from a new angle, also the scale and scope of the project -- combining cases from different socio-economic and ecological setting at three continents with theoretical and statistical work -- will generate new knowledge and be highly rewarding. Though challenging, I am confident that my background in economics and ecology puts me in an ideal position to achieve this important task. My ultimate goal is to identify circumstances in which natural preconditions and the social setting may go hand in hand to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources.",
