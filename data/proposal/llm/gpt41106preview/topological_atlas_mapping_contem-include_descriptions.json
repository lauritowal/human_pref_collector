        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn an era where borders are increasingly dynamic and multifaceted, the concept of the border itself is facing radical reevaluation. The proposed research program seeks to address this complexity through the creation of a digital atlas that employs a novel methodology named Topological Atlas. This project aims to map, analyze, and intervene in border areas by crafting visual counter-geographies that reflect the diverse experiences of individuals interacting with these spaces—particularly those at the peripheries of traditional geopolitical discourse.\n\nThe Topological Atlas approach is innovative in its integration of digital technology with participatory methods, focusing on the lived realities of migrants and the security mechanisms that regulate their movements. The project challenges conventional cartography, which is dominated by GIS technology and platforms like Google Earth, by offering maps that foster 'seamless transitions' between the migrant space and that of the controlling security apparatus. Through this, it endeavors to subvert the cartographic norms that reinforce existing power structures.\n\nThe project is transdisciplinary, engaging with topology both as a conceptual framework and a methodological tool to represent borders as topological entities, understood through the experiences of those who navigate them. It is especially attuned to crisis contexts, suggesting alternate forms of visual and co-produced research that move beyond traditional international relations or security-focused perspectives. This approach also critically examines the reciprocal relationship between scholarly inquiry, the generation of knowledge, and the practical implications of such knowledge.\n\nCentral to the research agenda is the question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them? The intent is to offer a new model for understanding and interacting with border areas, one that is grounded in the real-world implications of border politics and the individuals most directly affected by them."

They have been variously conceptualised as porous, shifting and solidified. Where a border may be open for some, for others it is an impenetrable wall. Combined with the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations that operate beyond legal frameworks, such as the formation of ISIS and the situation in Europe where borders are being opened and closed against agreed treaties, the very concept of the border is being radically questioned. We need new ways to make sense of these increasingly complex spaces. This proposal aims to develop a transdisciplinary research programme for mapping, analysing and intervening in border areas in the form of a digital atlas. Topological Atlas is developed as a methodology for producing visual counter-geographies at border sites. It is ground breaking in its use of digital technologies combined with a participative approach that attends to those who are at the margins of traditional geopolitical inquiry. The project uses topology as conceptual framework and methodology to make maps that produce ‘seamless transitions’ from the space of the migrant to that of the security apparatus that creates barriers to her movement. In doing so it seeks to disrupt the cartographic norms that are being reinforced through the prevalence of GIS technology and mapping platforms such as Google Earth. It investigates forms of visual and co-produced research adapted to situations of crisis and proposes a new model for researching border areas beyond the current top-down international relations or security perspective. At the same time it acknowledges the intertwined relationship between the practice of academic inquiry, the knowledge it produces and what such knowledge can do. The project is organised around the following research question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?",
