        "Abstract:\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of governmental structural change remains a critical question within political science. While conventional wisdom attributes these changes to the influence of political parties, this perspective overlooks the historical evolution of government structures that predate modern party systems and the recent global decline in party-centric governance. The STATE-DNA project aims to fill this gap in scholarship by proposing a novel theory of evolutionary government, where structural change is conceptualized as a product of the interaction between a governmental unit's structural characteristics and its organizational as well as environmental context. This approach transcends traditional party-centric models, allowing for a multifaceted exploration of the causes of change and their direct impact on government policy.\n\nThe project sets out to create the most extensive dataset to date, tracing the 'building blocks' of government—units within ministries and agencies—from the 'primordial soup' of the early 19th century to the present (1815–2025), across six countries and approximately 150,000 units. STATE-DNA employs innovative genetic measures to assess these structural changes and leverages historical data on legislative activity, organizational features, and environmental variables.\n\nBy harnessing advanced biological methodologies, such as data assimilation techniques, STATE-DNA will conduct a groundbreaking analysis of the origins and implications of structural change in government. This research not only promises to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving change but also introduces a predictive element to the field of government studies, with potential applications for anticipating and managing future structural evolution within state systems."

Traditionally, the answer refers to political parties exercising control over a state bureaucracy. Yet government structures have been changing ever since they emerged alongside the modern state and thus already before parties existed. The recent decline of party government worldwide also begs the question whether other actors and mechanisms matter that have been underestimated so far. Meanwhile, it became a truism that “structure shapes policy”, but existing research focuses on other effects of structural change in government, such as democratic and economic outcomes or cabinet governance. We lack systematic analyses of how structural change affects government policy. To address these gaps, STATE-DNA studies the change of units inside ministries and agencies as the ‘building blocks’ of the modern state. It submits a novel theory of evolutionary government that regards structural change in government as an interplay between a unit’s structural features and its organizational and environmental environment. This notion of multiple levels allows to study more than ‘party-centric’ causes of change and, for the first time, to analyze the effects on government policy explicitly, as evolutionary consequences managed by distinct units. STATE-DNA breaks new ground by applying genetic measures to assess structural change in government, establishing the most comprehensive data set, which begins with the ‘primordial soup’ of the early 19th century when government structures fragmented (~150,000 units, six countries, 1815–2025). For the empirical analyses, existing (historical) data on legislative activity, organizational, and environmental features will be used and extended. STATE-DNA will exploit methodological advancements in biology, such as data assimilation techniques, to analyze the origins and consequences of structural change in government and to forecast such change, thereby injecting a predictive notion into government studies.",
