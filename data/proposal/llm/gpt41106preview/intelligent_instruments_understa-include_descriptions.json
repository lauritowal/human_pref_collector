    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, resembling human capabilities more closely, particularly in creative domains such as music, it is imperative to understand the implications of this technological advancement on our concepts of art, culture, and society. The proposed research project seeks to investigate how creative AI is transforming our interactions with technology and each other by focusing on music as a central theme. This innovative study will explore the integration of AI in musical creativity through three targeted work packages: the development of AI-powered musical instruments, the collaborative processes between humans and AI in music creation, and the use of sonic instruments as a means to study intelligent instruments as scientific tools.\n\nThe project aims to foster public discourse on creative AI and establish a theoretical model that articulates the shifting perceptions of self, relationships, and knowledge in the context of intelligent instrument usage. It will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, uniting experts across various fields to conduct groundbreaking research on intelligent instruments as interfaces that bridge disciplines. Leveraging open science practices, the research outcomes will delve into the impact of creative AI on embodied technologies and enhance the understanding of AI's role in future societal structures.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI), with a robust background in music, philosophy, computer science, and AI, as well as significant experience in academic leadership, is ideally suited to spearhead this transformative research endeavor. By balancing technological innovation with humanistic inquiry, the project promises to contribute to multiple academic domains by formulating a theoretical framework for creative AI, sparking conversation around human-centric AI creativity, and establishing ethical guidelines for AI design in everyday applications."

But what does this mean? How does creative AI change our notions of art, culture and society? As new machine learning technologies begin to mirror ourselves, we need to look into that mirror and ask how this is changing us. This project takes a pioneering leap in research about AI by answering how new creative AI transforms our relationships with technology and other people. This ambitious vision is achieved by using music as a platform to establish public understanding of AI. Three respective work packages will develop: 1) instruments with creative AI; 2) human-AI collaboration in music; and 3) sonic instruments as scientific instruments. The project initiates a public discourse on creative AI and develops a theoretical framework describing the transformed notions of self, others and knowledge when we adopt intelligent instruments in our work. INTENT is interdisciplinary in nature. Applying the methodology of our new research collaboration protocol, we summon researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct frontier science on intelligent instruments as boundary objects. Through open science methods the outcomes will address: a) the role of creative AI in embodied technologies, and b) the understanding and reflection of artificial intelligence in future society. The PI is an established authority on new instruments and music software development. His interdisciplinary background in music, philosophy and computer science and AI, together with impactful academic leadership roles make him uniquely placed to lead this radical research programme. Grounded equally in technology development and the humanities, the project will benefit diverse disciplines by developing a theoretical framework of creative AI, initiating a discourse around human-centred creative AI, and defining principles of ethical AI design in services and products.",
