        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to illuminate the historical trajectory and interdisciplinary development of the concepts of 'global psyche' and transcultural psychiatry. It aims to provide a pioneering historical analysis of the genesis and evolution of these ideas, particularly in relation to their colonial and post-colonial underpinnings and the subsequent global mental health movement. This investigation will argue that the notion of a universal mental constitution gained prominence post-World War II and throughout the decolonization era. During this period, Western psychiatry endeavored to shed its colonial vestiges and foster an equitable dialogue with non-Western mental health perspectives.\n\nThe project will critically dissect the era when leading psychiatrists worldwide sought to establish universal psychological mechanisms believed to be common across different cultures and 'civilizations'. This quest for a redefined 'common humanity' unfolded within a context of growing global connectivity and cultural diversity. The research will scrutinize the historical dynamics that powered this search and the profession's efforts to balance the investigation of cultural specificities with the creation of novel, cross-cultural mental models.\n\nFundamental questions will be addressed, examining how post-WWII and post-colonial psychiatrists and anthropologists reconceptualized the links between culture, race, and the individual psyche. Additionally, the project will assess the contributions of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe to this transformative epoch. A key objective is to evaluate whether this emergent global and transcultural psychiatry truly managed to break free from its colonial legacy.\n\nThe outcomes of this research stand to contribute significantly to contemporary debates on the universality of mental health concepts and provide a comprehensive, historically grounded account of the development of transcultural psychiatry. It promises to advance our understanding of the global mental health paradigm, its origins, challenges, and its potential future trajectories."

It will offer the first historical analysis of the colonial and post-colonial roots of the current global mental health movement, and the first systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. It will argue that the concept of universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of WWII and during decolonisation, when Western psychiatry strove to leave behind its colonial legacies, and lay the foundation for a more inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities. In this period, leading psychiatrists across the globe set about identifying and defining the universal psychological mechanisms supposedly shared among all cultures (and 'civilisations'). I will explore this far-reaching psychiatric, social and cultural search for a new definition of 'common humanity', which developed in an increasingly inter-connected and culturally diverse global context, and examine the historical forces that drove it. I will also examine how the profession negotiated the tensions between researching cultural particularities and developing new, cross-cultural models of the mind. The project will answer some of the core questions related to this transformative period: How did psychiatrists and anthropologists from all over the world re-define the relationship between culture, race and individual psyche following the end of the Second World War and colonialism, what was the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in this transformative process, and did this new global and transcultural psychiatry succeed in departing from the erstwhile colonial frameworks?",
