        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents the Multimodal Assessment of Deprivation-Induced Visual Systems (MADVIS), a groundbreaking study designed to explore the dynamic interplay between crossmodal plasticity and sight restoration. The occipital cortex, traditionally associated with visual processing, has been shown to undergo significant functional reorganization in response to blindness, adapting to support non-visual inputs. MADVIS aims to dissect the complexities of this adaptation, focusing on how visual deprivation during various developmental periods influences the occipital cortex's organization and connectivity. The project is poised to make significant advances in two key areas: firstly, elucidating the impact of sensitive developmental periods on the occipital cortex's response to visual deprivation, and secondly, applying this knowledge to predict and enhance outcomes for sight restoration procedures.\n\nEmploying cutting-edge techniques at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and ophthalmology, MADVIS will significantly advance our understanding of brain plasticity. The findings promise to inform the development of new predictive models for sensory restoration, bridging the gap between crossmodal cortical reorganization and the rehabilitation of visual function. Ultimately, MADVIS aspires to lay the groundwork for future predictive surveys that will optimize the success of sight restoration interventions, heralding a new era in therapeutic strategies for individuals with visual impairments."

These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity, classically considered compensatory, inevitably raise crucial challenges for sight-restoration. The neglected relation between crossmodal plasticity and sight-recovery will represent the testing ground of MADVIS in order to gain important novel insights on how specific brain regions become, stay and change their functional tuning toward the processing of specific stimuli. The main goal of MADVIS is therefore to make a breakthrough on two fronts: (1) understanding how visual deprivation at different sensitive periods in development affects the functional organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex; and (2) use the fundamental knowledge derived from (1) to test and predict the outcome of sight restoration. Using a pioneering interdisciplinary approach that crosses the boundaries between cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, MADVIS will have a large impact on our understanding of how experience at different sensitive periods shapes the response properties of specific brain regions. Finally, in its attempt to fill the existing gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, MADVIS will eventually pave the way for a new generation of predictive surveys prior to sensory restoration.",
