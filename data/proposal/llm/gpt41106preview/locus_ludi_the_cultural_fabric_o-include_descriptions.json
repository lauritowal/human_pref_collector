        "Abstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal seeks funding to support \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity,\" a pioneering research project aimed at conducting the first comprehensive study of ludic culture from the birth of the Greek city-state to the end of the Western Roman Empire. Play and games have been integral to human societies, serving not merely as leisure activities but as significant cultural and societal touchstones that reflect and shape identities and values. Despite the ubiquity of play in antiquity, its study has been marginalized due to contemporary biases that dismiss such activities as trivial. Locus Ludi endeavors to challenge this perception by meticulously examining written, archaeological, and iconographic evidence that has been largely overlooked in museums and libraries.\n\nThe project will span a timeline from approximately 800 BCE to 500 CE, encompassing both Greek and Roman societies. By applying linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological methodologies, the research team will identify, categorize, and reconstruct ancient games and play, exploring their significance in gender, religious, economic, and political spheres. Furthermore, the study will delve into the role of play in cultural transmission and heritage, its evolution, and its part in societal interactions, such as the romanisation process and religious transitions.\n\nThis research will be informed by contemporary theoretical, gender, and education studies, aiming to provide a nuanced understanding of the ancient world's cultural tapestry. The outcomes of Locus Ludi will have broad implications, offering new perspectives for related academic fields, and producing accessible resources for educational institutions, museums, and libraries. Ultimately, by decoding the educational, societal, and integrative functions of play in classical antiquity, the project seeks to contribute to current discussions on modern play, technology, and social engagement."

Even gods played. Ludic culture created communities from early childhood to a ripe old age. Did these groups play together, or did they play different games, with distinct rules? And did they play similar games to us? This interdisciplinary project will provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence. Written, archaeological and iconographic sources are abundant, but forgotten in museums and libraries. This neglect is due to the modern Western view of games as childrenâ€™s pastime, if not a waste of time. Ancient play and games reflect the gendered, religious, economic, and political fabric of a society, as much as they shape the lives of players by transmitting a cultural identity and an intangible heritage. Ludic culture evolves over time and this project intends to provide a benchmark by reconstructing this history in the Greek world, from the birth of the city-state, c. 800 BCE, to the Roman conquest in 146 BCE, and in the Roman world from the Republican age, c. 500 BCE, to the end of the Western Roman Empire, c. 500 CE. Locus Ludi will identify, categorize, and reconstruct games and play thanks to close linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological studies. Ludic culture also mirrors interactions between different populations, as in the romanisation process, and religious shifts. The research will be informed by theoretical studies of the past as well as by gender and education studies. It will generate a new vision of the cultural fabric of ancient society, provide models for training and research in related fields, as well as up-to-date material for schools, museums, and libraries. Understanding the educational, societal and integrative role of play in the past is important to understand the present and widen the debate on high tech toys and new forms of sociability.",
