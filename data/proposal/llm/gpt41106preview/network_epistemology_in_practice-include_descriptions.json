        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering project situated at the intersection of the history and philosophy of science and digital humanities, aimed at elucidating the collective knowledge generation processes within large-scale scientific collaborations. The case study at the heart of this project is the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), known for its groundbreaking work in particle physics. A central hypothesis posits that a macroscopic analysis of the collaboration's internal communication, reconstructed from an extensive corpus of born-digital documents such as emails and wiki pages, can yield epistemologically significant insights into how knowledge is produced and corroborated in such a multidisciplinary and complex environment.\n\nBy employing advanced digital tools and methodologies, the project seeks to move beyond the traditional methods of studying scientific practice—largely confined to the evaluation of published papers, interviews, and participant observation—which have proven insufficient for capturing the intricacies of modern research dynamics. The proposed research will pioneer the development of historiographic guidelines to systematically approach digital archives, thereby setting a precedent for future epistemological inquiries into large-scale scientific endeavors.\n\nFurther, the project will enhance discourse in the philosophy of science, specifically addressing recent debates in network epistemology. Adapting theoretical models to better represent the realities of contemporary scientific practice will provide a crucial philosophical contribution to our understanding of collective knowledge creation.\n\nIn summary, this project promises to deliver a comprehensive and nuanced portrayal of the research practices at CERN. The findings will not only contribute to the history and philosophy of science but also establish a robust framework for analyzing born-digital data, enriching our appreciation of the complexities inherent in modern scientific collaboration."

The project will focus on an investigation of recent research practice in particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in order to gain a better understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in very large scientific collaborations. The main working hypothesis of the project is that collective research processes can be characterized, in epistemologically relevant terms, through a bird’s eye view analysis of the collaboration’s internal communication. The internal communication will be reconstructed from born-digital documents (e-mails, internal wiki pages, etc.) which accrue in the research practice of the collaboration. Abstracting from the case study, the project will also develop historiographic guidelines that can be transferred to future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations. Last but not least, the project will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, in particular to recent issues in “network epistemology”, by adapting the theoretical models to better fit important real-world cases. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to capture large-scale and complex research processes, such as the ones at CERN, and make them accessible for epistemological analysis. Almost all the studies of the research practice at CERN or similar cases have so far been restricted to the analysis of published articles, selected interviews and participant observation. Accompanied by historiographic guidelines and practical strategies (both of which are lacking at the moment) for best practices in the history and philosophy of science based on born-digital sources, the application of digital tools and computational methods may finally help us attain a maximally comprehensive picture of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond.",
