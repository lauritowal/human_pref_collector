        "**Abstract:**\n\nUnderstanding the intertwined development of adolescent social networks and the social brain is vital for insights into human social functioning. Adolescence represents a pivotal period where the maturation of social-cognitive functions is both influenced by and reflected in the dynamics of social networks. This proposal seeks to bridge the gap between social network research and social brain research by examining how alterations in the social brain correspond to shifts in social network roles and configurations during this critical developmental stage.\n\nTo achieve this, the proposed study will implement a synergistic methodology, combining the quantitative rigor of social network analysis with the experimental precision of social neuroscience. A longitudinal study design will follow a cohort of 1000 adolescents across 50 classroom settings, with six data collection points over a span of three years. A subset of 100 participants will undergo annual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess task-related brain activation and connectivity, thereby providing a neural dimension to the investigation.\n\nThe research will delve into the neural and behavioral underpinnings of social cognition through tasks designed to assess the understanding of and interaction with others. Additionally, social behavior will be monitored through ecological momentary assessments, while social network structures will be delineated using a combination of traditional surveys and innovative mobile sensing techniques.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is a nuanced understanding of the bidirectional relationship between the social brain and social networks during adolescence. By elucidating this reciprocal influence, the research holds the promise of informing interventions that can positively steer social development, with potential long-term benefits for individual well-being and societal cohesion."

Social scientists have scrutinized the structure of the elaborate social networks that characterize todayâ€™s society. Neuroscientists have elucidated the brain mechanisms underlying our ability to navigate this social world. Yet, these research lines have been largely separated. This proposal aims to integrate social network research and social brain research, focusing on adolescence as the most dynamic phase shaping the interplay between social networks and the social brain. Social development in adolescents is clearly driven by maturation of specific social-cognitive functions; yet these functions are manifest in, and moulded by, interpersonal relationships within social networks. I aim to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development. This can be achieved by using the quantitative tools of social network analysis in conjunction with the experimental approach of social neuroscience. I plan to investigate a cohort of approximately 1000 adolescents nested in 50 classes in a longitudinal design with 6 measurements over 3 years; fMRI investigating task-related functional activation and connectivity is conducted yearly in a subsample of 100. The neural and behavioural correlates of social cognition are investigated using experimental tasks tapping i) understanding others and ii) interacting with others; social behaviour is charted through ecological momentary assessment techniques; social networks are mapped using surveys and digital information acquired routinely via mobile phones (mobile sensing). This approach clarifies how during a crucial developmental phase the social brain shapes the social environment, and vice versa, the social environment influences maturation of the social brain.",
