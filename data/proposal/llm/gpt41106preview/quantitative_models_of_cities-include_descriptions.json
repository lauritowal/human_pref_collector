        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project proposed herein seeks to advance the understanding of urban economics by examining the pronounced disparities in economic activity characterized by the dichotomy between urban and rural areas. Building upon recent progress in the accessibility of high-resolution spatial data and theoretical advancements in the study of city dynamics, the research aims to explore the underpinnings of location choices within cities and the resulting economic consequences. Leveraging the comprehensive register data from Denmark, which documents every resident, the project will introduce four innovative dimensions to the study of urban economics.\n\nFirstly, the project will integrate quantitative urban models, derived from the applicant's previous research, with the extensive Danish data, thus providing an unprecedented level of detail in analyzing urban phenomena. Secondly, the research will pioneer a dynamic version of existing static models, using structural estimation techniques to harness the rich information within the Danish registers. Thirdly, the project will break new ground by moving beyond the simplified assumptions of uniform workers and singular output typifying current models, instead embracing the diverse heterogeneity inherent in the workforce and firm landscape evident in the Danish context.\n\nFinally, the proposal stands out in its direct engagement with policy-relevant issues. Through sophisticated modelling and empirical investigation, the research will assess the widespread implications of urban transport infrastructure enhancements and the impact of regulatory measures, such as height restrictions, on urban development and welfare. The outcomes of this project are expected to provide critical insights into the forces of agglomeration, the evolution of commuting patterns, and the growth trajectories of cities, thereby offering a valuable tool for policymakers to shape future urban landscapes with a view towards optimizing economic welfare."

Within countries, this is most clearly illustrated by the vast differences in economic activity between cities and rural areas. Despite this first-order economic phenomenon, the study of the economics of cities has been a niche interest for much of the 20th century. This has changed recently with the arrival of data with a high level of spatial resolution for cities and key theoretical breakthroughs. In particular, Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding and Sturm (2020) develop an empirically tractable model of location choices in cities. They show how this model can be used to estimate the strength of agglomeration forces in cities and the effect of the construction of the railways on commuting flows and city growth. This project will take our understanding of the economics of cities to the next level by innovating along four different dimensions. First, the project will combine quantitative urban models that build on my prior work with extraordinary detailed register data covering every person in Denmark. Second, the project will develop a dynamic version of the current static models and structurally estimate this model with the information available in the Danish data. Third, the rich heterogeneity that can be observed in the Danish register data will make it possible to innovate on the current state of the art, which assumes ex-ante identical workers and a single output, and allow for worker and firm heterogeneity. Fourth, the modelling and empirical work will directly address questions of first-order policy relevance. These questions include evaluating the general equilibrium benefits of improvements in urban transport infrastructure, and the effect of height restrictions and other planning interventions on the growth and welfare of cities.",
