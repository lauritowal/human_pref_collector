        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research project designed to examine the influence of legislatures on democratic processes within African electoral authoritarian regimes. The study aims to address a significant gap in contemporary political science by scrutinizing the dualistic theories currently posited about the impact of legislative bodies in autocracies. On one hand, some scholars argue that the introduction of elections, national assemblies, and multiparty systems can serve to entrench autocratic rule. On the other hand, there is a contrasting perspective that suggests the repetition of multiparty elections inherently leads to democratization. The lack of clarity on this issue is compounded by the secretive nature of authoritarian governments and a paucity of existing research, particularly concerning African nations.\n\nTo navigate these challenges, the proposed research will collect and analyze data from authoritarian legislatures in seven African countries, focusing on three key areas: legislative law-making processes, the nature of political dialogue and interaction patterns between ruling and opposition parties, and the level of representation and responsiveness to constituents. The methodological approach will be a Mixed Methods-Design, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data. Content analysis will be applied to parliamentary debates to explore legislative law-making, while full population surveys in the national assemblies will gather biographical, opinion, and social interaction data. This data will be further examined using Social Network Analysis techniques. Additionally, process tracing will be employed to decode the causal relationship between legislative behavior and democratic progression.\n\nThis ambitious project promises to deliver comprehensive and systematic empirical evidence on the role of legislatures in African electoral autocracies, a scholarly endeavor that has not been previously undertaken. With a robust network of partner institutions across the seven countries, this research has the potential to provide critical insights into the complex dynamics that shape the trajectory of democracy in African authoritarian contexts."

This project seeks to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes. There are two opposing theoretical views: While several studies have found that holding elections, introducing a national assembly and a multiparty system prolongs the life of autocracies, other authors claim the exact opposite: in their view, the more successive multiparty elections take place, the more democratic a regime becomes. Answering these questions is difficult due to the opaqueness of authoritarian regimes. Moreover, most work has concentrated on only a few cases â€“ African cases, in particular, have remained largely absent from the research agenda. This project attempts to fill these gaps by collecting data on authoritarian legislatures in seven African countries. We focus on three areas of investigation: 1) law-making; 2) interaction patterns and political dialogue between the ruling party and the opposition; and 3) representation and constituency responsiveness. The main question is whether legislatures in authoritarian countries actually have a potential to enhance democracy. We use a Mixed Methods-Design which combines qualitative and quantitative data. To answer Question 1, we use content analysis of parliamentary debates. For Question 2 and 3, we will conduct full population surveys in the national assemblies of our seven countries. We will collect biographical and opinion data, as well as data on the social interactions between government and opposition, which will be analyzed with the methods of Social Network Analysis. Furthermore, we employ process tracing to understand the causal mechanism between legislative behaviour and the level of democracy. With a strong team of partner institutions in seven African countries, this project fills a research gap by collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behaviour in electoral autocracies for the first time.",
