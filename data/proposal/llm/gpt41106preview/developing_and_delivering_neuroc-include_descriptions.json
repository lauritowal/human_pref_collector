        "Abstract:\n\nThe frontiers of cognitive neuroscience hold the transformative potential to illuminate the enigmatic nexus between the human brain and mind, particularly in understanding how cognitive functions emerge from neural activities and their implications for neurological patient care. This research seeks to advance our grasp on the neural underpinnings of cognitive processes by synthesizing three critical elements: the analysis of complex mental behaviors, the delineation of neural systems, and, notably, the development of pioneering methods that cohesively integrate cognitive and systems neuroscience. Previous strides in experimental psychology and behavioural neurology have provided insights into intricate mental behaviors, while in vivo neuroimaging technologies have facilitated the exploration of neural systems. The ERC Advanced grant proposed herein aims to achieve a groundbreaking third component: creating methodologies and tools for systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience.\n\nCentral to this initiative are two innovative activities: the simultaneous application of neuroscience and cognitive methods to foster a convergence of findings, and the evolution of neurocomputational models that embody a dualistic approach, linking neuroanatomy with cognitive functions. These models, traditionally employed to replicate both normal and impaired behaviors, possess the latent capacity to integrate computational architecture with systems-level neuroanatomy and function. This grant aims to harness this potential, enabling simulations of detailed cognitive behavior while concurrently reflecting the architecture of neural systems.\n\nBy achieving this integration, the project will not only provide a novel formalism for connecting brain and cognition but will also offer a transformative framework for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurological impairments, significantly benefiting scientific understanding and clinical practice. The ambition of this research is no less than to establish a new paradigm in cognitive-clinical neuroscience, bridging the final gap in our understanding of the brain-mind relationship."

This is crucial, scientifically, if we are to understand the nature of mental processes and how they arise from neural machinery but also, clinically, if we are to establish the basis of neurological patients’ impairments, their clinical management and treatment. Cognitive-clinical neuroscience depends on three ingredients: (a) investigating complex mental behaviours and the underlying cognitive processes; (b) mapping neural systems and their function; and (c) methods and tools that can bridge the gap between brain and mental behaviour. Experimental psychology and behavioural neurology has delivered the first component. In vivo neuroimaging and other allied technologies allow us to probe and map neural systems, their connectivity and neurobiological responses. The principal aim of this ERC Advanced grant is to secure, for the first time, the crucial third ingredient – the methods and tools for bridging systematically between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. The grant will be based on two main activities: (i) convergence of methods – instead of employing each neuroscience and cognitive method independently, they will be planned and executed simultaneously to force a convergence of results; and (ii) development of a new type of neurocomputational model - to provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. Computational models are used in cognitive science to mimic normal and impaired behaviour. Such models also have an as-yet untapped potential to connect neuroanatomy and cognition: latent in every model is a kind of brain-mind duality – each model is based on a computational architecture which generates behaviour. We will retain the ability to simulate detailed cognitive behaviour but simultaneously make the models’ architecture reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function.",
