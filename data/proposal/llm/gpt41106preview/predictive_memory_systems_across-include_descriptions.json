        "**Abstract:**\n\nUnderstanding how the human brain operates is a central challenge in neuroscience. Recent theories suggest that the brain functions as a prediction machine, continuously generating and updating internal models to anticipate future events. This grant proposal introduces Project PIVOTAL (Prediction In Variably Organized Temporal Anticipation and Learning), which aims to investigate two fundamental aspects of this predictive coding framework: the nature and development of internal models and the variation of predictive processes across the human lifespan.\n\nPIVOTAL seeks to elucidate how experiential factors shape internal models, which are essential for generating predictions. It will explore how these models are influenced by episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences) and semantic memory (general world knowledge), and how they differ across age groups due to maturation and aging. The project will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to reveal the cognitive and neural underpinnings of predictive processing in diverse populations, including children, young adults, and older adults. These groups represent distinct stages of cognitive development and neurocognitive integrity, offering insights into the brain's capacity for adaptation through prediction.\n\nBy integrating cognitive neuroscience research on predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development, PIVOTAL will advance our understanding of neurocognitive architecture. The project's innovative approach will provide a more dynamic view of the predictive brain, with implications for identifying critical periods in the emergence of neurological and cognitive disorders. This research is poised to make a significant contribution to the field by unraveling the complex interplay between memory, prediction, and age-related brain changes, ultimately informing interventions to maintain cognitive health across the human lifespan."

For this, the predictive coding framework emerges as a promising route, with the notion that the brain operates as a prediction machine; internal models in the brain predict future states against which incoming information of new experience is compared. This new conceptual framework leads to two essential empirical questions that PIVOTAL will tackle: (1) What is the nature of the internal models on which predictions are generated and how do our actual experiences shape them? (2) How do prediction processes play out in human brains that are inherently diverse due to changes such as those caused by maturation and senescence. Addressing these issues is important for advancing our basic understanding of the neurocognitive architectures that enable the brain to perform adaptively in our environment, with predictive processing as a fundamental operation. PIVOTAL will integrate three separate strands of cognitive neuroscience research on predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental research designs, we aim to unravel the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie predictive processing based on individualsâ€™ memory of prior experience (episodic memory) and well-learned knowledge about the world (semantic memory). These mechanisms will be systematically examined in samples of children, younger adults, and older adults, who differ from each other in important ways due to divergence in developmental orientation (progression vs. conservation) and neurocognitive landscape (structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits). By explicating a more dynamic version of the predictive brain principle, we can start addressing issues related to the emergence of disorders at particular time windows in life.",
