        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe intricate relationship between dietary choices and sensory feedback is a cornerstone of behavioral modulation. While the role of post-ingestive energy signals in preference formation is established in animal models, as evidenced by sugar-induced striatal dopamine release and preference conditioning via the vagus nerve, the underlying mechanisms in humans remain less understood. Despite replicated findings of increased consumption of flavor-paired carbohydrates, our meticulous experiments revealed no corresponding enhancement in flavor pleasantness post-ingestion. This discrepancy highlights a potential divergence in nutrient conditioning effects, emphasizing action value modulation rather than stimulus-associated pleasantness.\n\nOur proposed project, CalorieRL, seeks to unravel the complexities of post-ingestive food-seeking reinforcement through an innovative blend of computational reinforcement learning models and human probabilistic decision-making tasks. By leveraging the precision of computational approaches that have revolutionized the understanding of appetitive learning, CalorieRL aims to dissect the dopaminergic underpinnings and neural reward circuit activity that stem from post-ingestive sensory information processed via the vagus nerve.\n\nAdditionally, CalorieRL will employ functional and molecular brain imaging alongside peripheral nerve stimulation to offer a comprehensive analysis of these mechanisms. A crucial aspect of CalorieRL is the investigation of the relevance of post-ingestive reinforcement in the context of obesity, a growing global health concern. Through this multifaceted approach, we anticipate not only advancing the knowledge of dietary behavior modulation but also contributing to the development of targeted interventions for obesity and related disorders, grounded in an enhanced understanding of post-ingestive reinforcement."

Selection of food is guided by sensory feedback, including post-ingestive information about energy content, that has been studied across several species, paradigms and nutrients. In rodents, post-oral administration of sugar is associated with striatal dopamine release and conditions robust preferences, in part as a result of viscerosensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Consistently, in humans there is evidence that pairing a flavour with a tasteless carbohydrate will enhance pleasantness of the pre-ingestive stimulus and increase its consumption. However, available data in humans have provided limited mechanistic underpinnings for this process and, in our own experiments, performed with greater control of pre-ingestive stimulation, while we reproduced increased consumption of conditioned flavours, we found no evidence for post-ingestive mediated changes of pleasantness. Critically, this suggests that the impact of nutrient conditioning on behaviour and choice reflects the modulation of the value of actions, rather than that of associated stimuli. The application of computational reinforcement learning theory to human probabilistic decision-making tasks, which has allowed for renewed sophistication and progress to understand the mechanisms of appetitive learning, is yet to be applied to address this question. In CalorieRL, we will use computational reinforcement models applied to instrumental conditioning, in addition to brain functional and molecular imaging and peripheral nerve stimulation, to study post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behaviour. We hypothesize such behaviour has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits, resulting from sensory information transmitted through the vagus nerve. Importantly, we will also address if post-ingestive reinforcement is relevant in the context of obesity.",
