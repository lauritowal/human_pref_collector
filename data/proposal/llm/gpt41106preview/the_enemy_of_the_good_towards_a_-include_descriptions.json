        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to challenge and expand upon the predominant narrative of moral progress, which posits an ever-widening 'circle' of moral concern, historically moving from exclusive enfranchisement based on privileged categories to a more inclusive ethic embracing diversity in race, creed, gender, and even species. Traditional models suggest that moral advancement is synonymous with the broadening of this circle, advocating for the disregard of ethically arbitrary distinctions. However, this perspective is problematized by the inherent limitations within human psychology, such as the parochial nature of empathy and the kin-centric bias of altruism, which ostensibly cap the potential for moral extension.\n\nThe proposed research endeavors to construct an alternative framework for understanding moral progress. This will involve a meticulous examination of diverse modalities of moral evolution that are not inherently constrained by evolutionary psychology. The project aims to identify and cultivate moral attitudes that transcend genetic predispositions and to design innovative institutions capable of circumventing psychological barriers. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that the scope for moral progress is broader than previously acknowledged when alternative pathways, independent of the conventional expanding circle, are considered. This reimagined approach holds the promise of fostering a more pragmatic and achievable trajectory for advancing collective ethical standards."

Full moral status was only accorded to people of a certain class, age, gender, ethnicity, or religion. Over time, the moral franchise was gradually extended, however imperfectly, to include human beings of all races, creeds, or genders. Eventually, even species membership is recognized as morally irrelevant, and the moral circle is extended towards non-human animals as well. Many influential ethicists call this the “expanding circle” of moral concern. Moral progress, on this account, consists in further expansions of the moral realm beyond ethically arbitrary features. This account, however, faces a serious feasibility problem: our moral concern is limited due to features of our evolved psychology. Empathy is parochial; altruism remains tied to friends and kin. This project will develop an alternative theory of moral progress. By focusing on different forms of moral progress other than the expanding circle, different moral attitudes which are not subject to the same evolutionary constraints, and smart institutions that can bypass the limits of our inherited psychology, it will be shown that the prospects of moral progress have been severely underestimated.",
