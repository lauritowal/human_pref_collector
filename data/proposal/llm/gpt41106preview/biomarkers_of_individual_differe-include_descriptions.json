        "Abstract:\n\nThe PUPILTRAITS project seeks to explore the intricate relationship between visual perception, physiological state, and personality traits. While the mechanics of visual processing are well-documented, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the individual differences in perception; specifically, why some individuals prioritize global information (\"the forest\") over local details (\"the trees\"), and vice versa. This research aims to elucidate the underlying factors contributing to these perceptual styles and to establish new biomarkers for local context-independent perception, particularly in relation to autistic traits.\n\nThrough the utilization of cutting-edge techniques, including pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance imaging of the visual cortex, and advanced psychophysics, the study will investigate the co-variation of behavioral and cortical properties with personality traits. Preliminary data suggests a promising connection between these factors. A novel aspect of this research involves the induction of ketosis—a metabolic state achievable through fasting or intense physical activity—to assess its influence on early visual processing and subsequent perceptual style shifts within individuals.\n\nThe project's objectives include a comprehensive understanding of how metabolism affects cortical processing and perception, potentially revolutionizing our comprehension of pervasive developmental disorders like Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD). By recognizing ASD as a differential way of processing sensory information, this research could vastly improve diagnostic methods through the objective evaluation of perceptual styles. Furthermore, it opens up possibilities for innovative therapeutic interventions that target general physiology, such as dietary and exercise modifications, to transform perception and behavior.\n\nPUPILTRAITS stands to make a significant societal impact by reframing developmental disorders in terms of perceptual differences, enhancing the specificity of diagnoses, and fostering new approaches to therapy that are grounded in an individual's physical state and lifestyle."

We know in detail the fundamental steps leading to visual perception, but we do not know why normally sighted people differ in how they perceive: why some “see the forest before the trees”, while others have a fragmented perceptual experience focused on local features. PUPILTRAITS aims to fill this gap by taking an innovative approach to vision science, to understand how vision is affected by physiological state and personality traits. I will measure visual processing with both classic and new methods (that I helped develop), including pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance of human visual cortex, and psychophysics. Based on solid pilot data, I predict that differences in behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits, providing new reliable biomarkers of the local context-independent perception associated with autistics traits, even in young children (using pupillometry). These tools will also reveal changes of perception within individuals: during a safe and simple physiological intervention (ketosis, a metabolic state that can be naturally induced by fasting and intense physical activity), to show that early visual processing can be altered by acting on metabolism, and that this consequently affects holistic/local perceptual styles. My aim is to provide new knowledge on the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing and perception. This has the potential for a strong societal impact: it can change our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, like Autistic Spectrum Disorders, characterized by a different way of processing incoming information; it can aid their diagnosis through objective evaluation of perceptual styles, and encourage innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at changing perception and behavior by acting on general physiology: how we eat and exercise",
