        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the BabMed project, a pioneering research initiative aimed at conducting the first-ever comprehensive examination of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform script. BabMed is set to unravel the intricacies of the largest pre-Hippocratic collection of medical data, with a focus on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine documented in Aramaic within the Babylonian Talmud. This historically significant yet understudied corpus has eluded systematic scholarly analysis in relation to its cuneiform predecessors, leaving a gap in contemporary medical historiography.\n\nThe project seeks to test groundbreaking hypotheses, including the extended survival of cuneiform script and the derivation of Aramaic medicine from Akkadian traditions. By employing native taxonomies over modern disease classifications, BabMed aims to correct the anachronistic misinterpretations that have rendered past medical practices invisible in current medical histories. The research will also confront the Eurocentric bias that unduly elevates Greek medicine as the template for all ancient medical knowledge.\n\nBy comparing Babylonian medical systems with those of neighboring cultures, BabMed aspires to redefine the understanding of knowledge transfer in antiquity, revealing how ancient medical arts transcended barriers of script and language. The project posits that Babylonian medical knowledge persisted beyond the era of cuneiform through its preservation in the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a text reflecting the confluence of Greco-Roman and Persian influences. The grant will facilitate a transformative scholarly endeavor, repositioning Babylonian medicine as a critical node in the broader history of medical science."

The latest phase of Babylonian medicine, as preserved in Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud, has never been systematically studied in the light of older cuneiform materials. The absence of accessible cuneiform medical literature has forced recent medical histories to bypass Babylonian medicine, while Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has simply been ignored. BabMed tests a number of 'high risk' propositions, including two key hypotheses: 1) cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected, and 2) Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. BabMed's methodology relies upon native taxonomies rather than modern biomedical disease classifications, countering flawed retrospective diagnoses that obviate the entire history of medicine. Comparisons with neighbouring medical systems challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories, in which Greek medicine has become the standard for all ancient medicine. BabMed will introduce a new paradigm for knowledge transfer which will recognise the barriers between ancient arts of medicine and how they were overcome in antiquity. One such barrier was script and language, and BabMed proposes that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text which straddles the borders of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia and mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds.",
