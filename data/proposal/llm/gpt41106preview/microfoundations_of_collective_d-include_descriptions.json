        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe MICROCODE (Microfoundations of Collective Defence) project seeks to pioneer research into the critical yet under-explored role of public opinion in the functioning of military alliances, with a focus on NATO member states. Despite a history of allies failing to honor defence commitments, the influence of public sentiment on such high-stakes decisions remains unclear. This project proposes a comprehensive, cross-national analysis using experimental methodologies from political science, international relations, and political psychology to delve into the individual and collective attitudes towards collective defence scenarios.\n\nThe project's core objective is to develop a theoretical model that elucidates: (1) the process of attitude formation in individuals regarding allied assistance; (2) the aggregation of these attitudes into a broader public opinion influenced by societal cues; and (3) the consequential effect of public opinion on policy-making in allied nations. A primary hypothesis is that strategic context—ranging from clear acts of aggression to ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts—significantly affects public opinion formation and its policy implications. In particular, it is posited that less clear-cut conflicts may result in a greater \"contestation space,\" leading to more polarized and influential public perspectives.\n\nTo achieve its goals, MICROCODE will employ innovative immersive mixed-media experiments to simulate realistic defence scenarios for participants, thereby assessing changes in their support for allied defence under varying conditions. This methodological advancement promises to engage participants deeply and yield nuanced insights into the dynamics of opinion formation.\n\nGiven the deteriorating international security climate, the outcomes of the MICROCODE project have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the determinants of military alliance stability and credibility, with significant implications for both theory and policy."

The historical record shows that allied states often do not honour their collective defence commitments, but existing scholarship has not yet explained the role of public views in these high-stakes decisions. The MICROCODE project aims to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence that puts public opinion in allied countries at the centre of inquiry. Building on cutting-edge approaches in experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, I aim to conduct an extensive, cross-national investigation in the key NATO member states, with the views of individuals as the principal unit of analysis. I introduce a complex theoretical model to explain (1) how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios; (2) how these individual attitudes aggregate to form public opinion shaped by societal cues; and (3) how, in turn, public opinion shapes the views of decision-makers in allied states. My main set of hypotheses concerns the critical impact of the strategic context on the formation of public opinion and its relevance for policy-making: I propose that whereas conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression leave a limited role for public opinion, the more ambiguous “grey zone” conflicts potentially open a wide “contestation space” where public views become more polarised, elastic, and simultaneously more relevant for decision-makers. As a methodological innovation, I will use novel immersive mixed-media experiments to create an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for the participants and examine how their attitudes towards defending allies change under different conditions. At a time of dramatic deterioration of the international security environment, the MICROCODE project’s findings could redefine how we view the stability and credibility of military alliances.",
