        "**Abstract:**\n\nAs nations grapple with the challenges of a multicultural landscape, the perceived failure of coexistence policies has prompted a scholarly reassessment of how diverse communities interact. This research program embarks on a comparative, inductive exploration of ethno-religious coexistence, focusing on practical, everyday interactions rather than the theoretical underpinnings of policy. Through a series of case studies, the project, titled \"The Praxis of Coexistence,\" aims to uncover the organic strategies employed by various communities to navigate the complexities of living amidst diversity.\n\nThe core question guiding this inquiry is how communities spontaneously accommodate differences and what intrinsic resources they utilize to foster peaceful cohabitation and avert conflict among distinct religious and ethnic groups sharing the same social space. By shifting the analytical lens away from policy impacts, the research will delve into the cultural dimension of coexistence, spotlighting the expectations, aspirations, and cultural practices that inherently guide intergroup relations.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this program is to broaden the theoretical and normative frameworks for understanding coexistence, accounting for deep-seated differences, divergent worldviews, and a multiplicity of values. It posits that cultural practices and existing norms are critical components that must be considered in crafting effective approaches to managing diversity. This project holds the promise of informing more culturally resonant and sustainable coexistence policies, thereby addressing the urgent need for harmonious multicultural integration in a world marked by increasing ethno-religious diversity."

Over the past decade, growing and increasingly mainstream voices have declared multiculturalism to have failed, in such places as Europe, the United States, India, Israel, to name a few. In view of growing concerns over the ineffectiveness of current coexistence policies, and brewing ethno-religious conflicts, this research program will address this issue by taking a comparative approach to the question of ethno-religious coexistence in multiple sites. By examining cases of “ordinary” coexistence in situations of religious and ethnic diversity, the research seeks to understand how coexistence is actually practiced. The Praxis of Coexistence seeks to open an entirely new empirical, inductive, and comparative line of inquiry that does not seek to examine the effects of different policies on coexistence, but rather looks at coexistence practices to, among other things, achieve better policy. Understanding how people handle diversity spontaneously will enlighten us about what they “expect”, what they are looking for in coexistence. I ask: How do communities accommodate difference in spontaneous and culturally resonant ways? What resources do they actually draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict and violence between the different religious and ethnic groups that cohabit the same space? This project will open theoretical and normative space for a broader range of approaches to coexistence, ones that are attuned to questions of deep difference, divergent worldviews, and diverse values. In contrast to studies on the effects of policy or structural conditions on the dynamics of coexistence, this project will demonstrate why we should also take culture and existing practice seriously when considering the dilemmas of diversity.",
