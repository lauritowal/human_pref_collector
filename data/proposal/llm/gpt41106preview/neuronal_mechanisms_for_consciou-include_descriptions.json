        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe quest to decipher the neural underpinnings of consciousness remains one of the most captivating challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Our research endeavors to unravel the cerebral mechanisms that distinguish consciously perceived stimuli from those that escape awareness, with a focus on the interplay between conscious perception, attention, and working memory. Preliminary investigations in our laboratory suggest that simple visual stimuli become reportable when they invoke a threshold level of activity within the frontal cortex, implicating this region in the retention of stimuli within working memory. Conversely, the perception of complex stimuli appears to necessitate prolonged interactions between the visual cortex and associative areas, implicating processes of scene segmentation and visual attention.\n\nBuilding upon these findings, our grant proposal aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the neural trajectories of simple and complex stimuli, both within and outside of conscious perception, across a comprehensive array of brain regions. We plan to utilize intraoperative recordings from single neurons in human patients undergoing treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Additionally, we intend to implement innovative methodologies that allow for the recording of single neurons across an entire hemisphere in non-human primates, thereby facilitating a detailed characterization of neuronal activity throughout cortical and subcortical regions.\n\nThe proposed research will also employ perturbation techniques and functional imaging in monkeys to construct a functional connectome, enabling us to pinpoint the brain regions where activity correlates with the emergence of reportable experiences. This multifaceted approach is poised to offer an unparalleled view of the processes through which sensory stimuli are transformed into conscious perceptions, potentially leading to groundbreaking insights into the neural foundations of consciousness."

Why are some visual stimuli consciously perceived, whereas others remain subliminal? What is the relation between conscious perception, attention and working memory? Recent work of my lab demonstrated that weak but simple stimuli can be reported once they elicit a minimal level of activity in the frontal cortex, which is related to the storage of the stimulus in working memory. For these simple stimuli, the visual cortex acts as a relay station that needs to pass the information to higher cortical areas. However, we found that the perception of more complex visual stimuli relies on a more sustained interaction between visual cortex and associative brain regions, related to scene segmentation and visual attention. These recent results pave the way for a genuine understanding of mechanisms for consciousness, inspiring new paradigms that assess the awareness of stimuli while varying the demands on attention and working memory. The present proposal will be the first to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across most brain regions. We will measure the activity of single neurons in human patients who are implanted with electrodes as part of their treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We will also use a new method that permits the recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will use perturbation methods at numerous locations throughout the brain in combination with functional imaging in monkeys to measure a “functional connectome” and to investigate the brain regions in which activity does (or does not) readily lead to a reportable experience. The proposed combination of experiments will provide unprecedented insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception.",
