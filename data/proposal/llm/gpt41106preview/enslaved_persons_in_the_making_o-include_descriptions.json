        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"SLaVEgents: Rethinking Ancient Histories through Slave Agency\"**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the SLaVEgents project, a groundbreaking initiative that aims to redefine the understanding of ancient societies by highlighting the significant impact of enslaved individuals on the development of Western Eurasian and North African civilizations from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. SLaVEgents intends to delve into the multifaceted identities of enslaved persons, their sociocultural networks, and the pivotal roles they played in effecting transformative political, social, economic, and cultural shifts during antiquity.\n\nSLaVEgents is set to pioneer a comprehensive research approach by extending its analysis beyond the commonly studied contexts of classical Greece and Roman Italy to encompass the entirety of ancient slaveries spanning from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic. This extensive study will incorporate sources in an array of ancient languages, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, alongside pertinent archaeological evidence.\n\nThe project's interdisciplinary team, consisting of the principal investigator, eight senior researchers, seven postdoctoral researchers, and three doctoral candidates, will collaborate to construct a comprehensive digital prosopography. This database will catalog all recorded ancient slaves, presenting the data both in original languages and English translation. Leveraging Linked Open Data, the prosopography will facilitate innovative quantitative and qualitative scholarly inquiries, thereby advancing the field of Digital Humanities.\n\nDeliverables for SLaVEgents include a foundational monograph, two edited volumes, fifteen scholarly articles, and three doctoral theses. The project will also engage the academic community through three specialized workshops, an international conference, and the establishment of a dedicated website. By placing enslaved individuals at the forefront of historical narratives, SLaVEgents seeks to contribute a transformative and inclusive reexamination of antiquity, thereby reshaping contemporary perspectives on historical agency and social structures."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",
