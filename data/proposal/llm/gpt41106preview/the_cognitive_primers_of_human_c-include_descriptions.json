        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the PRIMERS project, an innovative research initiative aimed at unraveling the conditions that led to a defining moment in human evolution: the inception of sharp stone tool use. This behavior signifies the first discernible split between human and non-human animal technology and laid the foundation for the advanced culture that characterizes our species. PRIMERS seeks to elucidate when and how this pivotal shift occurred by exploring the cognitive and developmental prerequisites of innovation in primates, thus offering profound insights into the origins of human culture.\n\nThe research will employ a comprehensive triangulation methodology, examining the natural stone manipulation tendencies and the impact of exposure and experience on the ability to create and use flakes in three primate species: wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. The first objective is to determine each species' inherent propensities towards stone manipulation through cutting-edge artificial intelligence coding techniques. The second objective involves rigorously designed experiments with extensive sample sizes and prolonged testing periods to empirically assess innovation catalysts. The third objective aims to draw parallels between primate-produced stone assemblages and the earliest known human-made tools, thereby pinpointing the cognitive divergence between humans and our closest relatives.\n\nIn implementing a large-scale, controlled experimental framework and leveraging advanced statistical models like Structural Equation Models, the project will quantify the various factors' contributions and interplay in fostering innovation. PRIMERS' multi-faceted approach, encompassing a broad spectrum of primate species, enhanced experimental designs, and sophisticated analytical tools, promises to significantly advance our comprehension of the prerequisites for innovation. The outcomes of this research have the potential to redefine our understanding of the evolutionary journey that led to the unparalleled culture-building capabilities of humans."

By identifying the conditions driving innovations across primates, we can provide new insight into when and how humans developed this unique culture. PRIMERS will address this need by adopting a systematic and holistic approach to testing the catalysts of a watershed behaviour in our evolutionary history: the ability to make and use sharp stone tools (flakes). The advent of intentional flakes in the human lineage marks the first clear divergence between animal and human technology. With tools to access high-value calories, our ancestors now had the physical and cognitive resources to lay the groundwork for our culture. PRIMERS will use a triangulation approach to follow the emergence of flaking in appropriate proxy models: wild and captive chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. Objective 1 will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of these species using novel artificial intelligence coding methods. Objective 2 will test two other major drivers of innovations: exposure and experience. An experimental paradigm with in-built controls, large sample sizes (N =350), and long-term testing protocols (approx. 4 years) will be used to empirically evaluate the cognitive and developmental primers of innovations. Objective 3 will systematically compare primate assemblages to some of the oldest human stone tools, allowing for inferences to be made on when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Structural Equation Models will then determine the relative contributions and interactions between the measured factors. By testing three species, combining and upscaling experimental paradigms and implementing powerful modelling tools, PRIMERS will radically enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations, and with it, the primers of human culture.",
