        "Abstract:\n\nThe Strategic Transport and Routes in Ancient Domains (STRADA) project is an innovative endeavor that seeks to fundamentally enhance our understanding of the Roman Empire's economic cohesion and long-term sustainability by examining its inland transport systems. Despite the traditionally negative perspective held by Roman elites on transport, modern scholarship has recognized its critical role in the prosperity of the Roman economy. STRADA aims to construct a dynamic, computer-based simulation system that models both water and land transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube.\n\nThis project has three primary objectives: to investigate the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier; to analyze the impact of environmental factors on ancient transport networks; and to incorporate dynamic simulations into historical research methodologies. STRADA's approach is transdisciplinary, merging state-of-the-art technology, experimental data, and comprehensive historical analysis to achieve the most accurate transport time estimations.\n\nThe project's methodology consists of three interrelated components. Firstly, the project will meticulously reconstruct ancient land and water routes. Secondly, it will empirically determine the performance capacities of traditional means of transport under variable environmental conditions. Lastly, it will develop a time-sensitive simulation system that integrates detailed topographical data, historical weather patterns, various transport modes and loads, and the physical limitations of human and animal participants.\n\nDesigned to be modular, STRADA's system promises not only sustainability but also the potential for future expansion. The research will encompass a diverse set of landscapes, ensuring that the simulation system is versatile and adaptable to other geographical contexts and historical periods. By achieving these aims, STRADA will offer unprecedented insights into the economic networks that underpinned one of history's most formidable empires."

Therefore, it is an absolute desideratum to explore Roman inland transport transdisciplinary, combining recent technological developments with experimental data and profound historical research to gain the most realistic transport times. The objective of STRADA is the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system for water and land borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube. Thereby, STRADA is geared to three aims: a) the study of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, for gaining a better understanding of the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire, b) the analysis of the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system, c) and the introduction of dynamic simulations into historical research. For the implementation, the project will focus on three closely interwoven strands: The exact reconstruction of the ancient land- and water-routes, the experimental determination of the performance of the used land- and water-borne means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and the development of a time-related simulation system including local fine granular topography and historical weather data, different means of transport (water- and land-based) with different loads, the fatigue of the actors as well as necessary rests and loading times. STRADA will follow a modular design that will ease the sustainable use and a future extension of the simulation system. The chosen research area covers a wide range of landscapes from the Mediterranean lowlands, followed by different kinds of alpine regions, to a central European river landscape, which makes it easy adaptÂ¬able to other times and places.",
