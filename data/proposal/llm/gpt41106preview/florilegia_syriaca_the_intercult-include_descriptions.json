        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Florilegia and the Shaping of Syriac and Christian Arabic Thought in Late Antiquity\" (FLOS) seeks to investigate the transformation of Greek Christian intellectual traditions as they were transmitted and reshaped in Syriac and Arabic during the first millennium CE. Despite the significant role of Syriac Christianity as a conduit of cultural exchange in Late Antiquity, its contributions remain largely unrecognized in contemporary scholarship. FLOS aims to rectify this oversight by examining unexplored Syriac and Christian Arabic sources, particularly florilegia—anthologies that compiled and reinvented the patristic canon—to reveal their function as innovative cultural crucibles rather than mere repositories of tradition.\n\nThis initiative comprises two innovative objectives: the creation of open-access digital editions of selected 8th–10th-century Syriac florilegia and a comprehensive analysis of under-studied Syriac and Christian Arabic writings from the 8th–11th centuries. These texts, which engage with the doctrines of the incarnation and the Trinity, exemplify the adaptive use of patristic sources to forge new theological insights within the context of religious dialogue and competition, notably with Islam during the Abbasid period.\n\nBy illuminating these processes of intellectual evolution, FLOS endeavors to enhance our understanding of the dynamic cultural interplay that characterized Late Antiquity. The outcomes of this research will challenge the prevailing Greco-centric perspective and reposition patristic Christianity as a critical bridge linking European and Middle Eastern intellectual histories. Furthermore, FLOS's findings will offer valuable perspectives on contemporary religious discourse in Europe and contribute to the preservation of the cultural legacy of Syriac Christians, an endangered community. The project thus promises to make a substantial contribution to the fields of religious studies, interfaith relations, and heritage conservation."

Syriac Christianity was a pivotal mediator of culture in the Late Antique epistemic space, but is little-known today. FLOS aims to bring to light for the first time a body of highly relevant Syriac and Christian Arabic sources that have hardly ever been studied before. At the end of the millennium, in Islamic-ruled Syria, Mesopotamia, and Iran, Syriac Christians strived to define their religious identity. One of their strategies was the production of florilegia, i.e. anthologies that they used to excerpt and reinvent the patristic canon, a corpus of Greek Christian works of the 2nd–6th centuries shared by European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures. A Greco-centric bias has prevented scholars from viewing these florilegia as laboratories of cultural creativity. FLOS will reverse the state of the art through two groundbreaking endeavours: 1) open-access digital editions of a set of Syriac florilegia of the 8th–10th centuries; 2) a study of many neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors of the 8th–11th centuries. These tremendously important writings drew from Syriac patristic florilegia to pinpoint topics like incarnation and the Trinity against other Christians or Islam, showing how patristic sources were used to create new knowledge for the entangled environment of the Abbasid era. FLOS will thus dramatically improve our understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity; patristic Christianity will emerge as a bridge between the intellectual history of Europe and of the Middle East. By studying how this shared patrimony was transformed in situations of interreligious interaction, especially with Islam, FLOS will facilitate the comprehension of Europe’s current religious discourses, and the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of the Syriac Christians.",
