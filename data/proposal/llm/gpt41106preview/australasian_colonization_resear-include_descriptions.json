        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to explore one of archaeology's most compelling enigmas: the peopling of Australasia around 50,000 years ago, a migration that necessitated seafaring despite the absence of land bridges even during the lowest sea levels. The project aims to unravel the maritime aspects of this human dispersal, which are crucial to understanding early technological, cognitive, and social advancements. This research will move beyond traditional archaeological methods by employing a multidisciplinary approach, integrating marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics to answer fundamental questions about the earliest known open-water crossing from Sunda to Sahul.\n\nDue to the scarcity of early archaeological sites and the substantial changes in the submerged northwestern Australian palaeolandscape, the specifics of these ancient sea routes and the nature of these voyages remain largely speculative. The proposed study will investigate the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf to refine our understanding of the ancient onshore/offshore environments. It will seek to identify submerged prehistoric sites and reconstruct the palaeoshoreline and ancient tidal patterns.\n\nIn parallel, archaeogenetics will be employed to analyze mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data, which will provide insights into the demography, chronology, and migration patterns of these early humans. This groundbreaking research is poised to significantly advance our knowledge of human origins, the interaction between humans and their environment, population dynamics, and the development of seafaring technology and social structures. Bridging diverse scientific disciplines, this project represents a unique opportunity to address profound questions about early human history and the cognitive leap required for oceanic voyaging."

This represents some of the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa, yet, even at the greatest sea-level lowstand, this migration would have involved seafaring. It is the maritime nature of this dispersal which makes it so important to questions of technological, cognitive and social human development. These issues have traditionally been the preserve of archaeologists, but with a multidisciplinary approach that embraces cutting-edge marine geophysical, hydrodynamic and archaeogenetic analyses, we now have the opportunity to examine the When, Where, Who and How of the earliest seafaring in world history. The voyage from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia) provides evidence for the earliest ‘open water’ crossing in the world. A combination of the sparse number of early archaeological finds and the significant changes in the palaeolandscape and submergence of the broad north western Australian continental shelf, mean that little is known about the routes taken and what these crossings may have entailed. This project will combine research of the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf to refine our knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, identify potential submerged prehistoric sites and enhance our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. This will be combined with archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and dating. For the first time this project takes a truly multidisciplinary approach to address the colonization of Sahul, providing an unique opportunity to tackle some of the most important questions about human origins, the relationship between humans and the changing environment, population dynamics and migration, seafaring technology, social organisation and cognition.",
