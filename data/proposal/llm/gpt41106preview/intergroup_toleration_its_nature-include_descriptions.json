        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the urgent need to foster intergroup tolerance within increasingly diverse societies. As Europe grapples with the challenges posed by diversity, the capacity for intergroup tolerance emerges as a cornerstone for harmonious coexistence. This research aims to fill the significant gap in social psychological literature concerning the mechanisms of intergroup toleration. The proposed project will explore the complex phenomena of toleration by delineating its psychological components, processes, boundaries, and social implications. \n\nSpecifically, the research will dissect the objection component (underlying psychological aspects of tolerance), acceptance component (psychological processes facilitating tolerance), rejection component (limits of tolerance), and the experiential outcomes for those who are tolerated. Our innovative approach will integrate survey methodologies, framing experiments, and cutting-edge lab experiments, including the use of EEG technology, to gain a comprehensive understanding of intergroup toleration.\n\nThe results of this research will pave the way for creating actionable strategies to promote tolerance, aiming to enhance societal cohesion and equality. By pioneering a new direction in social psychology, this project stands to offer groundbreaking insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration at a time when such knowledge is critically needed. The anticipated findings have the potential to inform policy, guide interventions, and shape inclusive practices, making a significant impact on the fabric of diverse societies."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",
