        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project that investigates the phenomena of boat refugees and their quest for asylum across various periods and geographies. The study aims to explore and compare the experiences and receptions of boat refugees who braved perilous seas from the 1940s through the early 21st century, encompassing Jewish refugees in the 1940s, Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s and 1980s, Cubans and Haitians in the 1980s and 1990s, and diverse populations crossing the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean from the 1990s to the 2010s.\n\nThe central research question addresses how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary have influenced the experiences and reception of boat refugees. Guided by this inquiry, the research will delve into the dynamics of assistance and hindrance faced by refugees during their perilous journeys. Specifically, it will investigate the presence of solidarity among refugees, the aid from non-state actors such as merchant vessels and NGOs, state responses to refugees at sea, and the ultimate attainment of sanctuary.\n\nThis project's innovative approach is threefold: it conceptualizes the refugee experience through maritime routes (\"thinking through seas\"), it extends the analysis beyond state-centric perspectives (\"going beyond the state\"), and it conducts a comparative examination across different time periods and locations.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, the research team will use a diverse array of sources, including interviews with boat refugees, non-state and state actors, oral histories, state and NGO archives, legal cases, and contemporary media reports. The project's findings promise to offer new insights into the complex interplay of human mobility, international solidarity, and sovereign practices, making a significant contribution to our understanding of migration and asylum policies. The research is poised to reshape historical and contemporary discourse on refugees and asylum seekers, with implications for policy and humanitarian practice."

This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 198In 2015, over one million boat refugees sailed across the Mediterranean. This was not the first time that people took to the seas in search of asylum. During the 1940s, Jewish boat refugees voyaged across the Mediterranean; in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese boat people traversed the South China Sea; in the 1980s and 1990s, Cubans and Haitians tried to navigate the Caribbean to reach the US; and in the 1990s and 2000s, boat refugees sailed across the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and the Mediterranean in an attempt to reach Australia, Yemen, and Europe respectively. The central research question framing this project is: how did notions of solidarity, sovereignty and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? The research team will be guided by the related sub-question: who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? Each of the sub-projects will examine a) whether there was solidarity onboard between boat refugees, b) whether boat refugees encountered solidarity from non-state actors, such as merchant vessels, fishing boats and NGO search and rescue missions, c) how states responded to boat refugees at sea, and d) whether boat refugees attained sanctuary after their journey. This projectâ€™s ground-breaking character lies in three aspects: 1) thinking through seas, 2) going beyond the state, and 3) comparing the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space. The main sources that the project will rely upon will be interviews with boat refugees, non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage.",
