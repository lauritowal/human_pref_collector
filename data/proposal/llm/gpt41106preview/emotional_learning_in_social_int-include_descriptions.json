        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project aimed at exploring the intricate relationship between emotional learning and social interaction. The study seeks to delve into the biological and cognitive underpinnings of aversive learning within social contexts, bridging two previously unconnected research domains: the biology of aversive learning and social cognition. The project is structured around four key objectives: first, to delineate the mechanisms of aversive learning about others, influenced by both stimulus bound (e.g., ethnic group affiliation) and conceptual (e.g., moral and social status) factors; second, to investigate aversive learning from others via observation, examining the impact of stimulus bound (e.g., emotional expressiveness) and conceptual (e.g., empathy and mental state attributions) characteristics; third, to understand aversive learning during social interaction, focusing on the interplay of social characteristics as previously mentioned; and fourth, to construct and empirically validate a neural model of social-emotional learning.\n\nTo realize these goals, the research employs a multi-faceted methodological approach, incorporating cutting-edge behavioral paradigms, virtual reality environments, cognitive neuroscience techniques, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The hypothesis is that social-emotional learning operates through four partially overlapping neural networks responsible for affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed processes. While classical conditioning and social learning may share networks for affective and associative coding, social learning is thought to be uniquely characterized by the activation of the social-cognitive network. The instrumental/goal-directed network is anticipated to play a crucial role in learning through social interactions and the establishment of behavioral norms.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research have far-reaching implications, offering new insights into social dynamics such as group conflicts and conformity to norms. Furthermore, the findings have the potential to illuminate the pathophysiology of various psychological disorders, including social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy, which are marked by impairments in social emotional learning systems."

By bringing together a novel set of experimental manipulations with two hitherto unconnected lines of research; biology of aversive learning and social cognition, it aims at answering four specific objectives, namely to identify the mechanisms of aversive learning (1) about others and its dependence on stimulus bound (e.g. ethnic group belonging) and conceptual (e.g. moral and social status) characteristics; (2) from others through observation, and its dependence on processing of stimulus bound (e.g. emotional expressiveness) and conceptual (e.g. empathy and mental state attributions) characteristics; (3) during interaction and its dependence social characteristics as described in 1 and 2; and (4) build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. To achieve these objectives, I propose a multi-method research program using novel behavioral paradigms and manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. I predict that social emotional learning will be accomplished through the interaction of four, partially overlapping, neural networks coding for affective, associative, social cognitive and instrumental/goal directed aspects. Whereas the two first networks will be common to classical conditioning and social learning, I hypothesize that the latter will be distinguished by its reliance on the social-cognitive network. The fourth network is predicted to be integral to the social learning through interactions and the shaping of behavioral norms. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of important social phenomena, such as group conflicts and norm compliance. It will also shed light on common psychological disorders, such as social anxiety, autism and psychopathy that are characterized by dysfunctional of the social emotional learning system.",
