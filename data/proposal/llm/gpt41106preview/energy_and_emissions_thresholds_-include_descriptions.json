        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive study to elucidate the interplay between poverty eradication and climate change, focusing on the essential question of how to provide decent living standards to the global population without exacerbating environmental degradation. The lack of clarity regarding the energy requirements for a dignified life and the resultant climate impact forms the core of this research, which aims to bridge disciplines such as global justice, economics, energy systems, and industrial ecology.\n\nThe project will address three pivotal questions: What constitutes ‘decent living standards’ across different societies? What are the energy requirements for maintaining these standards in various contexts, and what is the consequent climate impact? Finally, how do these needs evolve with a country's development? The research will methodically define ‘decent living standards’ by identifying basic goods and services integral to human well-being, as evidenced in household consumption patterns. A rigorous analysis will quantify the energy and emissions footprint of these goods and services across five emerging economies, using lifecycle and input-output analyses, while accounting for variables such as culture, climate, and technology.\n\nThe study will also employ energy-economy integrated assessment modeling tools to map energy demand to climate change implications. Furthermore, by examining empirical data, it will explore the historical evolution of basic goods consumption and their energy intensity, aiming to uncover trends and path dependencies. The anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of how to support sustainable development pathways and inform equitable burden-sharing arrangements for global climate mitigation efforts. This research has the potential to inform policy and contribute to the global endeavor of balancing human development with environmental sustainability."

This is due to knowledge gaps related to the material basis of poverty, and the relationship between energy and human development. Addressing this issue rigorously requires bridging gaps between global justice, economics, energy systems analysis, and industrial ecology, and applying this knowledge to projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This project will develop a body of knowledge that quantifies the energy needs and related climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all. The research will address three questions: which goods and services, and with what characteristics, constitute ‘decent living standards’? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what impact will this energy use have on climate change? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? The first task will operationalize basic needs views of human development and advance their empirical validity by discerning characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. The second will quantify the energy needs (and climate-related emissions) for decent living constituents and reveal their dependence on culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions in countries. This will be done using lifecycle analysis and input-output analysis, and mapping energy to climate change using state-of-the-art energy-economy integrated assessment modelling tools for 5 emerging economies that face the challenges of eradicating poverty and mitigating climate change. The third task will shed light on path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity using empirical analysis. This research will identify opportunities to shift developing societies towards low-carbon pathways, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation.",
