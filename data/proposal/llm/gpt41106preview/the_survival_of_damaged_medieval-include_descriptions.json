        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal supports POLYCHROME, a research initiative aimed at investigating the historical trajectory and current vulnerabilities of polychromed Christian artifacts in the Nordic region post-Reformation. The project focuses on richly decorated ecclesiastical objects, including wooden sculptures, panel paintings, and altarpieces, that have transcended their original religious functions to become valued cultural heritage. With the Reformation marking a significant shift in the perception and treatment of such objects, the project seeks to unravel the complex history of these artworks, particularly examining the extent to which physical damage can be attributed to deliberate iconoclastic acts as opposed to accidental damage or general vandalism.\n\nThe lack of direct documentary evidence has led to a conservative approach among scholars and conservators, often ascribing damages to non-specific causes. POLYCHROME challenges this narrative by employing advanced scientific techniques to analyze approximately 150 polychromed objects, aiming to differentiate between violence-inflicted mutilation and other forms of damage. By uncovering and interpreting material evidence, the project intends to trace restoration efforts and understand the underlying motivations and methodologies applied over time.\n\nThe findings of this research will not only provide a nuanced understanding of the post-Reformation history of these objects but also inform conservation practices and heritage debates. The project's comprehensive analysis promises to shed light on the broader implications of religious transformations on cultural heritage, potentially revising the narrative of Lutheranism's preservationist role. Furthermore, the outcomes are expected to impact the training of conservators and the stewardship of religious artifacts in the Nordic countries, ensuring the informed preservation of this significant aspect of cultural heritage for future generations."

How have wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces transformed from potent objects of devotion to cultural heritage? To what extent is this category of cultural heritage at risk? Values attached to Catholic devotional objects have fluctuated dramatically since Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway declared a break with the church in Rome (1527 and 1537, respectively). However, documentary sources shed little light on changes in status, volatility, and repairs. POLYCHROME will take an ambitious leap that scholars concerned with polychromy in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been reluctant to make: to determine the extent to which losses of noses, eyes and limbs are tied to iconoclastic acts. To date, historians and most conservators have attributed damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism, but not to targeted violence. This is due in part to a lack of archival evidence, but also because secondary paints often mask critical information on surfaces and in internal structures. POLYCHROME will harness technologies from the natural sciences to create, from the ground up, the first analytical overview of c. 150 polychromed objects that are (or potentially were) partially mutilated. The material data will offer essential foundations for determining whether damages and losses can be linked to violence, accidents or inherent weakness. The data will guide the mapping of restorations and repairs, and will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates about heritage values and the future care of religious heritage in the Nordics. The outcomes will complicate conversations about the preserving effects of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects, and will influence training priorities for years to come.",
