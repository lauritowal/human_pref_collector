        "**Abstract:**\n\nEmpathy, the ability to share and comprehend the emotions and thoughts of others, is a hallmark of human social interaction, yet its developmental and evolutionary origins remain inadequately understood. The EMPORIGIN project aims to address this gap by investigating the emergence and nature of empathic behavior in infants and great apes, specifically bonobos, to discern the extent to which empathy is a human-specific trait or shared across species. Traditional views have underplayed the empathic abilities of infants and great apes, possibly due to insufficient research methodologies. EMPORIGIN will employ cutting-edge techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking in conjunction with longitudinal studies and novel experimental designs to explore empathy in these groups comprehensively.\n\nThe project will analyze developmental trajectories of bonobo infants in both wild and semi-captive settings, contrasting these with human infant development in two culturally distinct societies, Vanuatu and Samoa, which practice distributed caregiving but differ in social structure and emotional expression. This cross-species and cross-cultural framework will enable EMPORIGIN to generate transformative insights into the evolution and development of empathy, challenging the assumption of its human exclusivity.\n\nEMPORIGIN hypothesizes that a foundational empathic capacity is shared between humans and bonobos, with divergence occurring in humans' enhanced inclination to alleviate others' emotional distress and engage in reciprocal emotional interactions. These divergences may have catalyzed unique aspects of human cooperation and social sharing. By integrating methodologies from biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, EMPORIGIN aspires to redefine our understanding of empathy, illuminating its origins and questioning the current paradigm of its uniqueness to humans."

However, we lack knowledge about the origins of empathy and to what extent its sub-components reflect species and cultural universals. Studying infants and great apes enables us to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy and the extent of its human uniqueness. Until now, it has largely been assumed that infants and great apes lack the capacity for empathy. However, this claim may reflect a lack of adequate methodologies and research attention, leaving infant and great ape empathy underestimated. Now, combining novel techniques to investigate empathy comparatively (thermal-imaging, pupillometry and eye-tracking) with longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, EMPORIGIN will overcome this issue to provide the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Rich datasets on bonobo (wild and semi-captive) infant development and caregiver interactions will be compared to those from human infants in two small-scale, traditional societies – Vanuatu and Samoa. Both societies show distributed-caregiving but vary in societal structure and emotional expressivity. Using a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN will deliver step-change insights into empathy development that go far beyond the State-of-the-Art. We will test the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in a greater motivation to ameliorate others’ emotional states and a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. These capacities could lead to a cascade of human-unique forms of sharing and co-operation. Combining approaches across biology, psychology, ethology and anthropology, EMPORIGIN will advance our understanding of the origins of empathy, one of our most remarkable capacities, and challenge current perspectives about its human uniqueness.",
