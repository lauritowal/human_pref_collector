        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal seeks to advance the field of market design by introducing a novel theoretical framework, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), which acknowledges and incorporates the pervasive issue of inequality into the structure of marketplaces. Traditional economic models prioritize allocative efficiency, often neglecting the substantial disparities among market participants. IMD challenges this paradigm by proposing a mechanism-design approach that emphasizes redistributive preferences and welfare considerations alongside efficiency. By focusing on the imbalance of welfare weights among individuals, IMD aims to identify optimal market structures that recognize both private information about participants' willingness to trade and their relative welfare positions.\n\nThe central hypothesis of the project posits that when inequalities are substantial and identifiable from market behaviors, it may be justifiable to deviate from purely efficient allocations in favor of more equitable distributions of surplus, even at the cost of some efficiency. Such scenarios could justify interventions like inefficient rationing, which have traditionally been eschewed by market-efficiency proponents. The research will empirically test this hypothesis and delineate the conditions under which IMD approaches outperform traditional market designs.\n\nThe proposed theory of IMD stands to make significant contributions to both academic discourse and practical policy formulation. It diverges from the classical focus on efficiency and revenue in mechanism design, and instead, it synergizes with the public-finance approach of using taxation for redistribution. The resulting insights from this project will provide valuable guidance to policymakers who grapple with the challenge of rectifying market-induced inequalities without sacrificing the benefits that well-designed markets can offer. This research offers a transformative perspective on how markets can be structured to balance efficiency with equity in the presence of inherent social disparities."

Yet, traditional economic intuition opposes these sorts of policies because—unlike well-functioning markets—they introduce allocative inefficiency. In this project, I will explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). My approach is to deploy a mechanism-design framework that identifies the optimal way to structure the market. In the baseline framework, the designer maximizes a welfare function whose welfare weights reflect her redistributive preferences induced by the inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information both about their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. Research will focus on testing the validity and scope of the main hypothesis: When inequalities are sufficiently pronounced and can be detected based on agents’ behavior in the market, it becomes optimal to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable split of surplus. For example, optimal market designs may involve inefficient rationing. Inequality-aware Market Design provides a novel way to address the growing problem of inequality in market-design settings. The redistributive objective distinguishes this theory from the traditional mechanism-design literature that has focused predominantly on efficiency and revenue as design goals; the focus on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace complements the public-finance approach to redistribution through the tax system. IMD provides policy guidance by explaining whether and how policymakers concerned about inequality should resort to distortionary market interventions.",
