    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative anthropological research project that seeks to explore the multifaceted concept of combat trauma within military and psychiatric institutions across three Western nations: Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Recognizing that trauma holds diverse meanings and values across different social and economic contexts, the study aims to dissect the processes by which clinical definitions of combat trauma are constructed, modified, contested, and assimilated within these varied national settings.\n\nThe proposed research will employ a comprehensive methodological approach, intertwining ethnographic fieldwork with veterans, rigorous investigation of clinical practices, and critical analysis of the policies and discourses that give shape to the notion of combat trauma. This tripartite methodology is designed to foster a comparative understanding of the interplay between two significant modern institutions—the military and psychiatry—and their influence on the conceptualization of combat-related psychological distress.\n\nIn a departure from traditional trauma studies, this research aspires to illuminate the discordant values regarding violence and suffering that may be obscured within military and psychiatric circles. Particularly, it will examine how the interplay of ethnicity within these institutions affects veterans' experiences, thereby offering insights into the treatment of marginalized ethnic groups.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this study include the identification of central challenges in providing effective care to veterans, which has the potential to inform policy and healthcare improvements. Theoretically, the research promises to enhance the academic discourse on biopolitics and the medicalization of mental health, challenging existing theories that often overlook patient resistance to clinical illness models. It will delve into the unique resistance that may emerge in the context of combat trauma, an area that remains under-explored.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to make a substantial contribution to our understanding of how societies internalize and institutionalize war-induced suffering as clinical illness, while also engaging with the evolving landscape of psychiatry as it increasingly embraces biological interpretations of mental health conditions."

Trauma means different things to different actors, and acquires a different value (both economic and social) in different therapeutic settings. Research will examine how clinical notions of combat trauma are established, adapted, resisted or internalized in different nations. It will result in a comparative framework for understanding how combat trauma is shaped by two major modern institutions: the military and psychiatry. Methodologically, it combines ethnographic fieldwork with veterans, research on clinical practices, and analysis of the policies and discourses that institutionalize combat trauma. Unusual within trauma studies, it aims to shed light on potentially conflicting values about violence and suffering in military and psychiatric instiutions, which may be less apparent to researchers trained within those institutions. By analyzing how veterans and clinicians perceive ethnicity, it will also contribute to understanding of the experiences of subordinate ethnic groups in military and psychiatric institutions. It is expected to identify key problems in the delivery of good care to veterans and have an impact on policy and healthcare. Theoretically, it will advance studies of biopolitics and medicalization. Existing theories tend to minimize how patients contest clinical models of illness. The moral significance of violence in combat trauma may, however, create particular kinds of resistance to clinical illness models – an issue that has not been previously addressed. This study will make a major contribution to understanding how war related suffering is internalized and institutionalized as clinical illness. It will also advance social science studies of psychiatry during a time when the field is undergoing a major and controversial move towards a biological approach to mental illness.",
