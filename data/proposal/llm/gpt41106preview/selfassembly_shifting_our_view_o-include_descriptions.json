        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe AssemblingLife project proposes a transformative approach to the philosophy of science as it pertains to the study of living systems. Traditional biological paradigms depict life as a laborious process, perpetually driven by energy consumption and meticulously orchestrated by genetic directives. This perspective dominates our comprehension of biological phenomena, shaping the explanatory models in philosophy of science. However, this project challenges the conventional view, hypothesizing that life may not be as energetically demanding as presumed, and that genes may play a role more akin to gentle influencers rather than rigid commanders of biological processes.\n\nCentral to our inquiry is the concept of self-assembly — the autonomous organization of components into intricate structures without external guidance, akin to lego bricks spontaneously forming a fortress. This phenomenon, a focus of cutting-edge research in nanoscience intersecting chemistry, biology, and materials science, leverages self-assembly for the creation of novel materials and technologies, offering fresh insights into the workings of life.\n\nAssemblingLife aims to construct an interdisciplinary theoretical framework within the philosophy of science, grounded in the burgeoning knowledge of self-assembly. The objective is to reconceptualize genetic causation, viewing genes as subtle influencers that nudge self-assembly, rather than as micromanagers dictating life's processes. Furthermore, the project seeks to develop a novel theory of scientific explanation, acknowledging that self-assembled systems diverge from classical mechanistic behaviors or interventionist models.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a redefined understanding of genetic influence, an innovative explanatory paradigm that aligns with the characteristics of self-assembly, and a set of conceptual tools that bridge philosophical and empirical insights. By reevaluating the foundational principles of life, AssemblingLife aspires to enrich philosophical discourse and empower empirical research in the life sciences, fostering a paradigm shift in the understanding of life's complexity."

Living beings are mainly viewed as systems requiring the constant input of energy and the detailed regulation by genetic material. These ideas of life very much influence the general understanding of living systems, and, particularly interesting for this project, it influences current philosophy of science accounts of the understanding and explanation of living processes. But what if life is much less “hard work” than often presented? And what if genes should be understood as “nudgers” rather than as “directing” living processes? Self-assembly is the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structure. It can be visualized as a pile of lego bricks turning into a Ninjago fortress on its own. There are no lego-builders. The parts “self-assemble”, possibly as a result of chemical and physical processes working between and on the parts. Recent nanoscience research efforts at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and material science, increasingly utilize self-assembly processes in the development of new materials, technologies and understanding of living systems. AssemblingLife will, on an interdisciplinary basis, build a new theoretical framework withing the philosophy of science for understanding and explaining life, building on the increasing focus and knowledge about self-assembly processes that carry the potential to shift our view of life. The project will provide a new understanding of genetic causation starting from the idea of genes as “nudging” self-assembly processes rather than as providing detailed regulation, and it will develop new theory of scientific explanation that will account for the observation that self-assembly processes do not behave like classical mechanisms or interventions targets. AssemblingLife plan for contributing novel and needed theory and conceptual tools both to the philosophy of science and to the empirical life sciences.",
