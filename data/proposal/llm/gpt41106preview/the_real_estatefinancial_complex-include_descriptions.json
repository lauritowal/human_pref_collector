        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to explore the intricately interwoven relationship between real estate, finance, and state institutions—a nexus that played a pivotal role in the 2007 global economic crisis. Despite the critical impact of these sectors, their interplay remains insufficiently understood and theorized. Current scholarship in political economy has delved into finance-state dynamics but has often overlooked the real estate sector. Conversely, research focusing on real estate-state interactions tends to emphasize municipal involvement in property development, frequently neglecting the financial dimension. This dichotomy points to a need for a holistic approach that bridges the gap between micro-level urban studies and macro-level political economy analyses.\n\nThe proposed research introduces the concept of the \"real estate/financial complex,\" drawing a parallel to the well-known military/industrial complex, suggesting a triangular relationship that includes states as a crucial element. This metaphor serves as a focal point for examining the intertwined nature of real estate, finance, and state apparatuses across different scales—local, national, and global.\n\nThe research team, led by the Principal Investigator (PI), will conduct a comprehensive, internationally comparative investigation. A Postdoctoral researcher will undertake both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the shifts within and between real estate and finance sectors. Three doctoral candidates will each study two countries, offering national mappings of the complex complemented by in-depth local urban case studies.\n\nThe PI will concentrate on qualitative transformations in the real estate and finance domains, the state's evolving role, the global ramifications of the real estate/financial complex, and the re-conceptualization of this complex in light of structural shifts in the relationships among state, society, and market. This multifaceted project aims to yield fresh insights into a critical yet underexplored economic triumvirate, with profound implications for understanding past crises and preventing future ones."

States and their many institutions have also been seen as complicit to the crisis. The connections between real estate (both residential and non-residential), finance and states still remain under-researched and under-theorized. Work in various political economy traditions has done a great deal of research into the connection between finance and states, but they have often ignored a crucial sector: real estate. There is also a tradition of work focusing on the interaction between real estate and states, usually concentrating on the involvement of municipalities in real estate projects. Finance is often ignored in this tradition. Moreover, this tradition has its roots in urban studies and is very micro focused, while the various political economy traditions are very macro focused. In other words, we not only need a stronger connection between finance and real estate, we also need a stronger connection between different scales: local/urban, national and global. I here propose a new metaphor that can help us to centre attention on the connection between real estate, finance and states: the real estate/financial complex, akin the military/industrial complex. Both complexes should be seen as triangles since states are also part of the equation. A Postdoc will do internationally comparative research on both the quantitative and qualitative shifts towards real estate, finance and their interaction. Three PhD students will focus on two countries each, each complementing two national mappings of the complex with two local/urban case studies. The PI will focus on the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance and the role of the state in this; the global dimensions of the complex; and the conceptualization of the complex in relation to the structural changes in state-society-market relations.",
