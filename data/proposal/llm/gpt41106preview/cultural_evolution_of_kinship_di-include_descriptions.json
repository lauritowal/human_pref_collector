        "Abstract:\n\nThe VARIKIN project embarks on an interdisciplinary journey to resolve the enigma surrounding the diverse classification of kinship within human societies. This innovative endeavor explores the evolution and variation of kinship systems, employing cultural evolutionary theory, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development to illuminate the patterns and processes underlying familial categorization. The project is segmented into three pivotal research streams.\n\nVARIKIN-Evolution examines the evolution of kinship diversity, leveraging comparative phylogenetic modeling to unravel the dynamics of change within eight language families. It probes into the existence of universal patterns of kinship evolution versus the influence of local cultural history and context. This subproject also scrutinizes the role of social norms in shaping kinship terminologies.\n\nVARIKIN-Usage delves into the actual application of kinship language, utilizing corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to decipher usage patterns in both spoken and written communication. It assesses the frequency and meanings attributed to kinship terms in various settings, seeking correlations between individual language use and historical shifts in kinship systems.\n\nLastly, VARIKIN-Development focuses on how kinship concepts are acquired and comprehended by children across cultures. Through participant observation and elicitation tasks in non-Western communities, this component aims to reveal potential universals in kinship learning and the extent to which socialization may constrain children’s kinship conceptualization.\n\nUniting these components is a comprehensive framework designed to integrate macro- and micro-evolutionary perspectives on kinship. Led by an Applicant with a robust multidisciplinary background, the VARIKIN project is poised to unravel the complexities of kinship classifications, offering groundbreaking insights into the cognitive and social underpinnings of how we define family within our diverse social landscapes."

Why are cousins classed with siblings in some societies but not others? Accounting for the variable ways that cultures classify kin is an enduring puzzle. The VARIKIN project takes a cultural evolutionary approach to variety and unity and engages different fields–cultural phylogenetics, corpus linguistics, and cross-cultural child development. VARIKIN-Evolution asks how and why does kinship diversity evolve across cultures and over time? Using comparative phylogenetic modeling of cultural evolution we investigate the dynamics of how kinship terminologies and family norms change in eight language families. Are there “universal” patterns of change, or does local cultural history and context determine changes in family organisation? How do social norms drive change in kinship terminology? VARIKIN-Usage investigates how people use kinship language by using corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to quantify patterns of usage in spoken and written language. How frequently are kinship terms used in different contexts and what meanings are more prevalent? Do patterns vary between languages, and can the patterns of usage at the individual level be linked to historical processes of change? VARIKIN-Development investigates how children acquire and understand kinship across cultures. Using participant observation and elicitation tasks, we characterise children’s social learning of kinship in a small-scale, non-Western community. Are there cross-cultural patterns of acquisition? Can socialisation produce constraints on the kinds of kinship children can learn? These three research directions are united by a coherent framework for the integration of macro- and micro-evolutionary processes. With a highly multidisciplinary background, the Applicant is uniquely positioned to direct this vanguard project towards a comprehensive understanding of diversity in how we classify our social worlds.",
