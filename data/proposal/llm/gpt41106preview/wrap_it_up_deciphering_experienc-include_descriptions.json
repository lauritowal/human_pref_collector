        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"WRAPPED\" (White matter Reorganization Across Development During Education and Practice) aims to elucidate the biological underpinnings of human brain plasticity, focusing on the role of myelin development in learning across the human lifespan. Unlike other species, humans exhibit an extended period of myelin maturation, which correlates with their unparalleled capacity for learning and skill acquisition. Leveraging recent advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, WRAPPED proposes to longitudinally monitor myelination in the human brain, correlating these changes with different stages of learning and development.\n\nThis research will adopt a two-fold strategy: conducting local longitudinal studies and analyzing large-scale open datasets to investigate myelination during learning processes. Such a comprehensive analysis will span from infancy—monitoring milestones such as crawling—to later life stages, including school-aged children, young adults, and the elderly as they engage in learning novel skills like juggling and reading Chinese. By encompassing the entire developmental spectrum, WRAPPED will provide insight into both maturational and learning-induced myelin changes.\n\nThe transformative potential of WRAPPED lies in its developmental scope, which will significantly enhance our understanding of how prolonged myelination contributes to the human capacity for complex cultural establishment and maintenance. The outcomes of this research will also serve as a critical benchmark for identifying and comprehending psychological and neurological disorders associated with myelin irregularities, offering a foundational reference for conditions like schizophrenia, autism, and learning disabilities. Ultimately, WRAPPED seeks to decode the intricate relationship between myelin dynamics and cognitive development, advancing our knowledge of the human brain's remarkable adaptability."

What is the biological basis of this remarkable plasticity? Animal studies suggest a critical role of myelin in learning and brain plasticity, while post-mortem assessments of the human brain show that myelin maturation, which is completed around birth in other species, continues until adulthood. How does this uniquely protracted myelin development enable and constrain our aptitude for learning? WRAPPED will answer this critical question by assessing changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. Recent critical advances in MRI technology now provide the unprecedented opportunity to compare myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals making it possible to probe the role of myelin in human learning for the first time. Seizing this opportunity, WRAPPED will assess learning-related changes in myelin using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. Critically, WRAPPED will not only evaluate adults, but rather probe the entire developmental lifespan to show how myelin changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults are acquiring the same novel skills (juggling and reading Chinese). This ambitious developmental focus will be transformative for our understanding of the interactions between maturational and learning-related changes in myelin. Thereby, WRAPPED will elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory that allows us to establish and maintain complex cultures. This characterization of healthy human brain plasticity, in turn, will serve as a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.",
