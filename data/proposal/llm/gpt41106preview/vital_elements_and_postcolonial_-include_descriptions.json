        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious research program seeking to address the pressing issue of the persistent loss of lives in the Mediterranean, as evidenced by the bodies arriving on the shores of Zarzis, Tunisia. The central question guiding this investigation is: How did these bodies end up here? The proposal postulates that these tragic events are not isolated incidents but symptomatic of a larger, systemic problem rooted in the (neo-)colonial depletion of livelihoods. To explore this hypothesis, the program proposes a novel methodological approach—forensics as the art of paying attention—which involves a detailed examination of the interconnectedness of \"vital elements\" essential to sustaining life.\n\nOur research will focus on tracing and analyzing the interactions between various vital elements such as phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and the disposal of industrial waste. By concentrating on Zarzis as a strategic nodal point, the program aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex material semiotic relations at play.\n\nThe research team will engage in cross-disciplinary collaboration, establishing a Method Lab for inter-site visits and synergistic research efforts. Additionally, the program will work closely with local artists through the Vital Elements Atelier to integrate and amplify local perspectives and concerns.\n\nThis research program is poised to make significant contributions by: (1) shifting the discourse from a Eurocentric \"migration crisis\" to the systemic \"chronic depletion of life\" in Africa, (2) pioneering the use of forensic ethnography to unravel the intricate web of relationships affecting life and death, and (3) enhancing the conceptual framework surrounding vital elements as dynamic forces that shape existence. Through this innovative approach, the program aims to deepen our understanding of the Mediterranean tragedies and contribute to more effective and empathetic policy responses."

This research program starts out from the question: How did these bodies end up here? While in Europe people who are adrift may be seen as evidence of a “migration crisis,” from the African side of the Mediterranean they point to the chronic, (neo-)colonial depletion of livelihoods. To map how life is enduringly made unliveable, this program develops the method of forensics as the art of paying attention. This method will allow us to trail exemplary vital elements—resources crucial for fostering life and livelihood—and the relations between them. Our cases include: the extraction of phosphate, the fishing of sea sponges, the cultivation of tomatoes, the extraction of water, and the leaving behind of industrial waste. To better understand the complexity of, and material semiotic relations between, vital elements, we focus on Zarzis as a nodal point. This will make it possible for team members to visit each other’s sites and to work together in a Method Lab as well as to collaborate with local artists who will help to sensitise us to local concerns in a Vital Elements Atelier. The research program is innovative in three ways: it (1) contributes to a decolonial shift of attention from the “migration crisis” befalling Europe to the “chronic depletion of life” afflicting Africa; (2) develops the method of forensics as an art of paying attention to ethnographically study the complexity of, and the relations between, vital elements and the ways they impact on living and dying; (3) advances the concept of vital elements for materialities that are active, make connections and foster life, or spur on death.",
