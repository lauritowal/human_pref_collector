        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the dynamic influence of technological advancements on corporate operations and individual prosperity through a comprehensive study. With technology reshaping the landscape of corporate-investor relations, our research aims to critically assess its impact on enhancing corporate transparency, environmental and social governance, and compensation equity. The study is structured around three pivotal pillars:\n\nFirstly, we aim to evaluate the effects of the transition from in-person to virtual shareholder meetings—a shift necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic—on shareholder engagement. Preliminary evidence suggests that virtual meetings may restrict shareholder interaction and enable companies to selectively address inquiries, possibly diluting shareholder influence.\n\nSecondly, the research will employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) to discern the disparity between corporate declarations and actions regarding environmental and social (ES) issues. The initial findings raise concerns that the market may disproportionately recognize companies for their ES declarations rather than their actual contributions, prompting a need for deeper investigation.\n\nLastly, we will scrutinize the relationship between employee demographics within the tech industry and their Equity-Based Compensation (EBC). This analysis will focus on disparities in compensation, particularly concerning gender, and how employees capitalize on their EBC. Understanding this relationship is critical for assessing shifts in the economic well-being of individuals and the broader economic landscape.\n\nThe culmination of these three research pillars will provide a multi-faceted understanding of technology’s role in the corporate world, offering insights into how it affects governance, accountability, and equity. This study will contribute to the discourse on leveraging technology for the betterment of corporate practices and individual wealth, ensuring that the tide of technological progress lifts all boats in the corporate sea."

Technology is changing how investors interact with companies, how investors analyze and interpret the information provided by companies, and even the standard design of compensation in corporations. The goal of this study is to understand whether and how the increasing presence of technology is improving corporations and contributing to the wealth and prosperity of individuals/ investors, and when it is not. I will focus on the following three pillars that each focus on a unique technological development: (1) Communication with shareholders. Aim: To understand whether shareholders’ voice at shareholder meetings is muted following the shift of shareholder meetings from the in-person to the virtual-only arena (due to Covid-19). Initial findings indicate that this shift has minimized communication between shareholders and firms and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing questions submitted by shareholders. (2) Environment and social (ES) issues. Aim: To understand whether investors pay attention to what firms say they do on ES issues, or what they actually do. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to evaluate which actions firms state that they take with respect to ES, and these will be compared to the ES actions firms actually take. Initial results indicate that the market rewards firms that state they take actions promoting ES goals, but not firms that actually take such actions. (3) Compensation. – Aim: To examine how the characteristics of employees (e.g., gender) working in the tech industry relate to the EBC they receive, and their ability to maximize the value of their EBC and changes the economic landscape and welfare of individuals.",
