        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"GenTime: Comparative Study of Gender Inequality in Time Use Across East Asian and Western Societies\"**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the GenTime project, a pioneering sociological study designed to extend our understanding of welfare regimes and gender inequalities in time use beyond the Western context. Recognizing the limitations of existing frameworks, which are largely grounded in Western cultures, this research aims to uncover whether East Asian nations exhibit unique welfare typologies when considering the intersection of gender, culture, and social traditions.\n\nLeveraging new data from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, GenTime will conduct a comprehensive analysis of gender disparities in time allocation for unpaid work, daily activities, and life schedules across different welfare regimes. The project's objectives include exploring developmental trajectories and evaluating the role of unpaid labor within various social systems. By examining the systematic differences in time use between men and women, the study will illuminate the gender division of labor and social inequality across diverse regime types.\n\nA critical component of GenTime is its investigation into the impact of technology on care provision and domestic labor, assessing how these advancements may influence trends in gender inequality. Additionally, the project will explore the implications of these differences on leisure time and overall enjoyment in daily activities. Utilizing high-quality cross-national and historical comparative time diary data, along with household panel data, the research will provide insights into gender inequality at multiple levels: the household division of labor between couples, the societal influence of welfare regimes on domestic roles, and the long-term effects of time use on family outcomes from a life course perspective.\n\nBy offering a global perspective and identifying potential distinct East Asian welfare typologies, GenTime will fill a significant gap in our sociological knowledge. This research stands to inform public policy and contribute to the development of more inclusive and equitable social systems."

But these worlds, and later developments in this field, including the extension and application of the framework to gender roles, derive exclusively from Western models. What will emerge as we seek to develop a global perspective on other models of welfare regimes and how they handle gender inequalities? We will answer this question, using newly available data deriving from beyond the conventional Anglophone and European theatres: from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to explore patterns emerging from other cultural and social traditions. GenTime will be a study of gender inequality in patterns of time use across East Asian and Western societies. We will investigate the development trajectories and provision of unpaid work in different welfare regimes, and the systematic differences between men and women in the amount of time they spend on daily activities and their daily life schedules. It will examine time use as an important parameter of public policies. We will establish if East Asian regimes represent a distinct typology. The project will shed new light on the gender division of labour and social inequality across different regime types. Furthermore, we will examine how the use of modern technology in care provision and domestic labour may shape the trends in gender inequality. We will investigate the impacts on gender differences in leisure time and enjoyment in daily activities. High quality cross-national and historical comparative time diary data and household panel data will be analysed to study gender inequality 1) at the household level on how couples divide their roles in work and family; 2) at the societal level on the role of welfare regimes in shaping the trends in domestic division of labour; and 3) from a life course perspective on the impacts of time use on later family outcomes.",
