        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the P.S. project, aimed at intensifying the research into the cultural and linguistic landscape of the Early Modern Ages in Portugal and Spain through the rigorous examination of personal letters. These epistles, penned between the 17th and early 19th centuries, originate from a diverse populace including, but not limited to, servants, artisans, and political dissidents. Unique to this collection is the fact that these correspondences were confiscated by the Inquisition and civil courts, which also conducted quasi-sociological interviews, providing rich context for the study.\n\nOur project seeks to systematically gather, edit, and analyze these documents to uncover the nuanced interpersonal relations and communication patterns within traditional communities. The letters reveal a spectrum of human experience, from the expression of intimate emotions and common sense to the sharing of unorthodox beliefs and everyday occurrences. The P.S. project aspires to curate a substantial assemblage of these communications, previously only available in scarce quantities, and to produce a digital edition adhering to Textual Criticism standards. This collection will serve as a foundation for a thorough historical-linguistic study, bringing to light the vernacular discourse of the time—a facet of Early Modern history that remains largely unexplored."

The documents in question are original epistolary writings made by servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, political fighters, and many other types of social agents whose paths were crossed by the prosecuting ways of the Inquisition and the civil courts, two institutions that used to seize personal correspondence as instrumental proof. Since the documents are accompanied by the ‘sociological interviews’ carried out by inquisitors and judges, they allow researchers a well-contextualized study of traditional communities in their inter-personal modes of relation. The sources’ texts contain very frequently an (almost) oral rhetoric through which emotions were expressed, commonsense was stated, non-orthodox beliefs were confessed and trivial incidents were narrated. Until now, it has been difficult to discover more than thin samples of this Early Modern ‘popular’ discourse. The P.S. project will not only assemble a large collection of it, but it will also match its philological treatment – an online digital edition following Textual Criticism standards – with the cultural and linguistic study of its contents.",
