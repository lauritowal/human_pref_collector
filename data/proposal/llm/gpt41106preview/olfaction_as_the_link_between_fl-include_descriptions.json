        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe urgent need to shift human diets towards healthier and more sustainable choices is hampered by ingrained preferences for familiar food flavors. Critical to overcoming this obstacle is the understanding of how flavor preferences are formed and influenced by odor-taste associative learning—a primary perceptual support process. Currently, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of the cortical processes that endow environmental objects with appetitive properties based on oral olfactory cues. This project, OLFLINK, aims to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the integration of olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth through a three-tiered investigative approach.\n\nOLFLINK seeks to elucidate the distributed neural codes by which odors acquire and trigger taste associations (WP1), uncover cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of these associations amidst contextual changes (WP2), and examine how digestive feedback interacts with and regulates this flexible coding system during the acquisition and recall of flavor preferences (WP3). Importantly, WP3 will shed light on the body's capacity to modulate preference learning in response to nutritional signals, informing our understanding of maladaptive eating behaviors.\n\nThis comprehensive exploration will provide novel insights into the processes that connect perceptual experiences during food consumption with food evaluation in the broader environment. By identifying the factors that enable or impede the formation of new flavor preferences, OLFLINK has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand the biological underpinnings of eating patterns. The findings from this research will be instrumental in developing innovative strategies to promote dietary shifts throughout an individual's life, thereby addressing a pivotal challenge in public health and environmental sustainability."

Odor-taste associative learning is the principal perceptual support process for flavor preference formation and retrieval. Mechanistic insight into the cortical processes that transfer appetitive properties of an odor from the mouth onto environmental objects is, however, almost completely absent. As a result, fundamental questions about the processes that drive the acquisition of new flavor preferences, and their regulation by signals from the digestive tract, still remain to be answered. OLFLINK will uncover processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth across three nested levels of investigation that are usually studied in separation. In doing so, I propose to discover key factors that facilitate or hinder acquisition of new flavor preferences. Specifically, I will 1: determine the distributed CODE by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (WP1), 2: delineate the cortical CONTROL mechanisms that facilitate encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations in the light of contextual variability (WP2), and 3: determine the interactions with digestive feedback that REGULATE this flexible coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (WP3). This final step especially provides insight into the body’s ability to adjust learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and has potential to transform our thinking about the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. The novel insights from OLFLINK will fill the knowledge gap that currently exists between the mechanisms driving perceptual experiences during food consumption and the subsequent evaluation of food in the outside world, and will inspire the development of novel interventions to facilitate dietary changes over the life course.",
