        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project presents a novel examination of the early evolution of European political economy, challenging traditional narratives that have predominantly focused on the development of modern economic thought. By re-evaluating political economy as an Enlightenment-driven discourse aimed at enhancing human life conditions, the research seeks to disentangle the intricate relationship between Enlightenment ideals and economic theory. The project disputes the simplistic alignment of Enlightenment discourse with the foundations of political economy by delving into an extensive corpus of eighteenth-century literature on growth, wealth, and welfare that has been largely overlooked or misaligned in conventional historical accounts.\n\nRejecting the anachronistic tendency to interpret historical arguments through the lens of contemporary economic methods and models, the project instead investigates the practical preoccupations of the period—specifically, the policies and measures designed for societal betterment and improvement. This approach allows for a more authentic reconstruction of political economy as understood by early modern thinkers.\n\nCentral to the inquiry is the Swedish empire, contemporarily acclaimed as a bastion of 'oeconomia', which serves as the foundational case study. By juxtaposing the Swedish example with other geographical and political contexts, the project ensures a broader relevance and applicability of its conclusions. The research aims to meticulously trace the articulation of key concepts of improvement—wealth, growth, and welfare—across principal forums of intellectual exchange, including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and scholarly journals.\n\nOperating under the hypothesis that these institutions actively pursued the enhancement of state organization, societal structure, and the populace's living standards, the project aspires to offer a comprehensive and substantiated reevaluation of the ascendancy of economic discourse in the eighteenth century. This endeavor promises to reshape our understanding of political economy's place within the broader tapestry of Enlightenment thought and its enduring influence on Western civilization."

Historians of political economy have traditionally concentrated on the genesis of modern economics, tracing the emergence of economic models, methods and ideas that are today recognized as 'economics' through 'classical political economy', neo-classicism and on to the present. This new departure treats political economy as a discourse oriented to the improvement of conditions for human life and, as such, one of the Enlightenment’s key contributions to Western thought. However, any direct association of Enlightenment discourse with political economy requires qualification. Therefore, this project explores a very extensive contemporary literature about growth, wealth and welfare that has not fitted easily into the conventional retrospective history. Instead of converting past arguments into modern arguments about methods and models, the project investigates eighteenth-century political economy in terms of practical concerns, as measures and policies for betterment and improvement. Only in this way we can reconstruct what political economy meant to its contemporaries in the early modern period. The Swedish empire – considered by contemporaries as the stronghold of 'oeconomia' – functions as the primary case study, but is constantly compared with other cases, broadening the applicability of the findings. The aim of the project is to study the ways in which the key concepts of improvement – wealth, growth and welfare – were articulated in the main sites of discursive production: the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The study of the five institutions is based on the hypothesis that in each of them activities were directed towards improving the organisation of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project represents a well-founded reassessment of the rise to predominance of economic argument during the eighteenth century.",
