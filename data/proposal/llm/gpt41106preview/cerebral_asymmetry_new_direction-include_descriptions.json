        "Abstract:\n\nThe phenomenon of functional cerebral asymmetry, particularly the lateralization of language to the left hemisphere, remains an enigmatic aspect of human neurobiology. Despite Broca's assertion over a century ago that \"we speak with the left hemisphere,\" the underlying causes and implications of this bias are still not fully understood. This proposal seeks to elucidate the neurogenetic mechanisms contributing to language lateralization through a multifaceted research strategy that integrates genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging methodologies.\n\nFive interrelated projects will be undertaken to investigate the network efficiency hypothesis, positing that language development is optimized when language functions are organized within the same hemisphere. Project A will examine individual differences in language lateralization using behavioral assessments, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Project B will explore the increased risk of language and literacy impairments associated with cross-hemispheric representation of language functions.\n\nFurthermore, Project C will utilize twin studies to validate predictions from genetic models of language lateralization. Project D will investigate the 'double hit' genetic model, examining individuals with known disruptions in the neuroligin-neurexin circuit, such as those with an extra sex chromosome, to uncover the relationship between brain circuit anomalies and language deficits. Lastly, Project E will identify rare genetic mutations and structural variations linked to inconsistent left hemisphere language dominance.\n\nBy combining the study of typical and atypical cases of language development, this research aims to resolve contradictions in existing literature and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic and neurodevelopmental underpinnings of cerebral asymmetry. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of language lateralization, with implications for educational strategies and interventions for language-related disorders."

I propose that by studying cases of impaired language development and combining genetic and neuropsychological approaches we will be able to make a leap forward in our understanding of the quintessentially human characteristic of functional cerebral asymmetry. I argue that contradictory findings in the literature may be reconciled if we adopt a novel approach to cerebral asymmetry. In particular, I propose a network efficiency hypothesis which maintains that optimal development depends on organisation of key language functions within the same cerebral hemisphere. In project A, I will combine behavioural measures with functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) measures of blood flow and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralisation. In project B I will test the prediction that risk for language and literacy impairment is increased if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres. For project C, simulations of predictions from genetic models will be tested using data on twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralisation. Project D will test a 'double hit' genetic model that predicts that neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including language deficits and inconsistent asymmetry, arise when there is more than one hit on a functional brain circuit. For this study we will use an existing sample of individuals already known to have one 'hit' on the neuroligin-neurexin circuit, viz people with an additional dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome. Project E will focus on individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality and will look for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with a departure from consistent left hemisphere language.",
