        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the Research on Independence and Credibility in Agencies (RICA) project, an ambitious investigation set to revolutionize the conventional wisdom underpinning the European regulatory state. Traditionally, regulatory agencies have been deemed credible when insulated from political influences, creating an increasingly non-majoritarian system and prompting concerns over diminished democratic engagement. Current compensatory measures for legitimacy through accountability have been met with skepticism, as they are perceived to potentially erode the autonomy of regulatory agencies. RICA, drawing on political science and reputation literature, contests these long-held beliefs through a two-pronged approach.\n\nModule 1 of RICA confronts the presumed positive correlation between agency insulation and credibility. Contrary to established thought, the project hypothesizes that insulation may, in fact, tarnish regulatory credibility and engender a delegitimizing effect. This counterintuitive stance is crucial for reevaluating the design principles of regulatory institutions.\n\nModule 2 embarks on a groundbreaking redefinition of accountability within the regulatory framework. It proposes a novel theory of public accountability, deeply informed by reputational dynamics among regulatory actors. This module aims to empirically investigate how reputation influences the conduct and interaction of those responsible for regulation and those who hold them to account. RICA anticipates demonstrating that accountability, when wielded as a tool for reputation enhancement, can bolster rather than weaken autonomy.\n\nThe implications of RICA are profound, promising to reshape our understanding of regulatory credibility, accountability, and autonomy. The project's findings are poised to offer transformative strategies for regulatory control and institutional design, thereby ensuring that regulatory agencies can maintain their independence while enhancing their democratic legitimacy."

Arm’s length governance and regulatory independence have become the cornerstone normative and institutional design principles of the European regulatory state. Regulatory credibility is premised on agency insulation from politics with major systemic implications in the form of a rise in non-majoritarianism and a parallel devaluation of the political process. Efforts to compensate through alternative sources of input legitimacy have proven challenging. Conceptualised in a rational-choice tradition, accountability is seen to be in a zero-sum relationship with regulatory autonomy. Bolstering accountability is said to threaten autonomy, undermining the system’s normative foundations. Informed by insights from the political science literature on reputation, RICA profoundly questions these assumptions. It does so in two separate and interlocking tracks. Module 1 theorises about, and tests, the established wisdom of a wholesale positive relation between agency insulation and credibility. To the contrary, from a reputational perspective, a strategy of insulation is expected to have a negative effect on regulatory credibility, with overall delegitimising effects. Similarly informed by reputation insights, Module 2 challenges dominant understandings of accountability and puts forward the building blocks of a new theory of public accountability. The module draws out and studies empirically how reputation shapes the accountability behaviour of regulatory actors, both account-holders and account-givers, and their interactions. It will re-conceptualise the role played by accountability in the regulatory state as well as its relationship with autonomy. In contrast to dominant understandings, as a mechanism of reputation-building, accountability can reinforce autonomy with sweeping implications for regulatory control strategies and institutional design choices.",
