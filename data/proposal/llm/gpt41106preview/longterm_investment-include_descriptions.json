        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the evolving landscape of the 21st-century economy, the determinants of a firm's competitive edge have shifted from capital intensity to the nuanced arena of intangible assets. This project seeks to unravel the complexities of long-term investment in a firm's quality and reputation, examining its determinants and consequences across three critical dimensions: financial markets, incentives, and the tangible effects of investment.\n\nFirstly, we will challenge the conventional wisdom that financial markets pressure firms toward short-term gains at the expense of long-term value creation. Through rigorous analysis, we aim to uncover how market participants may, in fact, encourage investment by reflecting a firm's historical investments in stock prices and by forecasting future opportunities, thereby informing managerial decisions.\n\nSecondly, we will explore the horizon of incentives, a less-trodden path in research dominated by a focus on pay levels and performance sensitivity. Our theoretical and empirical investigation will delineate the optimal incentive horizon and its impact on long-term strategic choices, extending the inquiry to the educational sector to understand how incentives can shape a focus on students’ long-term success over immediate test results.\n\nLastly, we will confront the challenge of demonstrating the benefits of long-term investment in a firm's stakeholders—a facet of corporate social responsibility—by gathering and analyzing data that is often scarce. Our goal is to establish a robust link between such investments and firm value, thereby substantiating the case for long-term investment strategies.\n\nThis project promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into the cultivation of long-term value in contemporary firms, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing the long-term investment decisions that underpin sustainable success in today's dynamic business environment."

The 21st-century firm is different. Competitive success increasingly depends on product quality, which in turn hinges on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. Unlike tangible investment such as buying a factory, the fruits of intangible investment may take several years to appear. A manager pressured to maximise short-term earnings may fail to invest, jeopardising the long-term future of his firm. This project will study the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three linked components. Financial Markets. The traditional view is that financial markets dissuade investment by forcing firms to cater to short-term shareholders. I will study two channels through which markets promote investment. First, traders gather information about a firm’s past investments and incorporate it into stock prices by trading - rewarding the manager for good investment. Second, traders can gather information about a firm’s future investment opportunities - informing the manager about his future investment decisions. I aim to analyse what determines the efficiency of both channels. Incentives. Most research on incentives focuses on either the level of pay, or the sensitivity of pay to performance, but it is the horizon of incentives that is key to promoting investment. I will theoretically analyse the optimal incentive horizon, and empirically demonstrate how it affects long-term decisions. Moving beyond managers, I will study how to incentivise teachers to focus on their pupils’ long-run development rather than “teaching-to-the-test.” Effects of Investment. A key to inducing long-run investment is to demonstrate its benefits, but this is difficult due to data availability. I aim to gather data on a firm’s corporate social responsibility – its investment in its stakeholders – and link it to firm value.",
