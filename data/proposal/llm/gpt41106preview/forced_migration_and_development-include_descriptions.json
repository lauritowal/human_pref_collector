        "**Abstract:**\n\nAmidst an escalating global forced migration crisis, with 68.5 million individuals displaced by the end of 2016, the economic ramifications within developing countries—home to 85% of these populations—remain poorly understood. FORCEDMIGDEV endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap by dissecting the economic implications of forced migration, focusing on internal displacement and international refugees—phenomena with distinct economic characteristics.\n\nThe first segment of FORCEDMIGDEV employs a structural model to scrutinize the enduring economic impact of refugee influxes on developing nations, exemplified by Syrian refugees in Turkey, the predominant host country. This model will enable the investigation into pertinent questions applicable to both developing and developed countries: the distributional effects of refugee influxes, the welfare consequences across different regions, and the economic implications of granting refugees legal status.\n\nThe second segment advances the analysis by integrating reduced-form and structural approaches to explore the economic effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement, particularly within Brazil. This segment leverages unique data sets to calculate the immediate impact of displacement on various economic outcomes in the affected regions. Subsequently, a pioneering quantitative spatial model will be constructed to elucidate the equilibrium dynamics in both origin and destination areas, factoring in the complexities of congestion, agglomeration externalities, and labor market frictions. This model will be calibrated and applied to evaluate the extensive, both micro and macro, long-term consequences of internal displacement within the Brazilian context.\n\nFORCEDMIGDEV positions itself at the crossroads of climate and development economics, offering substantial potential for groundbreaking research pathways. The outcomes of this project aim to inform policy decisions and contribute to a more sustainable economic integration of displaced populations, ultimately fostering resilience in host communities within developing nations."

This crisis is vastly concentrated in developing countries, which host 85% of the world’s displaced population. Nevertheless, we still know relatively about the economic consequences of forced migration in these countries. FORCEDMIGDEV seeks to fill this gap. It is organised in complementary parts that analyse the two dimensions of forced migration – internal displacement and international migration (refugees) – which constitute very different economic phenomena. The first part develops a structural model to analyse the long-run impacts of refugee inflows in developing countries. The model is estimated and used to investigate the effects of the Syrian refugees in Turkey, the largest host country in the world. I am able to answer questions that are relevant for developing but also developed host countries. What are the distributional effects of refugee shocks? What are the welfare effects across regions? What are the effects of providing refugees with a legal status? The second part combines reduced-form and structural methods to investigate the effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement and its impacts on economic development. I take advantage of unique data availability in Brazil to estimate the reduced-form effects of internal displacement on a broad array of outcomes at destination. I then move to develop a novel quantitative spatial model that captures the equilibrium effects in origin and destination regions, while accounting for congestion and agglomeration externalities and labour market frictions. I estimate the model and use it to assess the long-run, micro and macro effects of internal displacement in Brazil. This part lies on the under-explored intersection of climate and development economics, which has a large potential to open new avenues for future research,",
