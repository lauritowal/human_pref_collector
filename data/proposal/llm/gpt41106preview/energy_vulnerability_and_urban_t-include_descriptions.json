        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for EvalUaTE, a pioneering research initiative aimed at advancing the understanding of energy poverty in Eastern and Central European (ECE) urban settings within the post-socialist context. Energy poverty, defined as the inability to afford basic heating requirements, affects millions of households in this region due to a complex interplay of factors, including skyrocketing energy costs, inefficient housing, aging infrastructure, and socio-economic transitions. The existing approach to this issue has been predominantly reductionist, focusing largely on income disparities and energy efficiency without adequately addressing the multifaceted nature of the problem.\n\nEvalUaTE proposes a groundbreaking analytical framework—energy vulnerability—to holistically examine the interrelated social and spatial determinants of domestic energy deprivation. Energy vulnerability captures the likelihood of households to fall short of essential energy needs, influenced by institutional policies, urban fabric, and daily life patterns. This comprehensive study will employ mixed methods, integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, to conduct a comparative analysis across eight urban districts within four cities: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje.\n\nThe outcomes of EvalUaTE are expected to significantly influence the discourse and practice surrounding energy poverty. By uncovering the nuanced factors contributing to energy vulnerability in post-socialist urban environments, the project will inform the refinement of existing policies and the design of innovative technical and institutional solutions. These improvements will not only enhance access to affordable, clean, and efficient energy for vulnerable populations but will also contribute to broader climate change mitigation efforts. The transformative potential of EvalUaTE lies in its ability to reconceptualize and address energy poverty as a multidimensional challenge, paving the way for more resilient and equitable urban energy futures in transitioning societies."

The limited body of scholarship and policy tends to conceptualize domestic energy deprivation in ECE through the narrow lens of incomes and energy efficiency. The purpose of this project is to radically transform the state of the art in the field by undertaking the first comprehensive investigation of the multiple social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the grain of the post-socialist city. The project will use an energy vulnerability framework to explore the causes, character and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE. Energy vulnerability can be seen as the propensity of a household to experience a lack of socially- and materially-necessitated energy services in the home. EvalUaTE will investigate the manner in which institutional structures, built tissues and everyday practices shape urban energy vulnerability. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will achieve its aims by undertaking a comparative study of eight urban districts within Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia). The knowledge gained from the project can potentially lead to the improvement of existing, or establishment of new, technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, ultimately aiding climate change mitigation.",
