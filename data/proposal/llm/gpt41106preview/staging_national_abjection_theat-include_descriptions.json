        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an interdisciplinary research project titled \"Staging National Abjection,\" which investigates the intersection of theatre and nation-building, focusing on Turkey and its diasporas. The study examines the dual role of theatre in both contributing to the delineation of national identity and serving as a medium for marginalized groups to contest the politics of belonging. The project spans from the emergence of European-style theatre in the mid-19th century Ottoman Empire to present-day productions, emphasizing the period's significance in shaping national consciousness.\n\nThe proposed research delves into under-explored thematic arenas, such as the theatrical representation of Armenians post-Genocide, the interplay of sexuality and national identity in queer drama, the dynamics of Islamic theatre within Turkey and its European diasporas, the cultural productions of Sephardic Jews both domestically and abroad, and the expressions of Alevi identity through theatre in Turkey and Europe. These case studies are strategically selected to shed light on the multifaceted concept of national abjection and to highlight the complexity of the political economy influencing contemporary Turkish theatre under the influence of a conservative neoliberal administration.\n\nMethodologically, the project will utilize a combination of archival research and ethnographic fieldwork, tapping into both mainstream and alternative sources to achieve a comprehensive analysis. By scrutinizing Turkey's unique position as a case study, the research aims to contribute significant theoretical insights into the broader implications of theatrical arts in shaping and challenging the politics of citizenship and belonging within nation-states.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are expected to enrich academic discourse on the role of artistic performance in national identity formation, expand our comprehension of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and offer innovative perspectives on cultural politics in post-Imperial settings and illiberal democracies."

This research will analyse how theatre has served the processes of national abjection, and how abjected minorities have used theatre to negotiate the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas. Employing a rigorous transdisciplinary theoretical and methodological framework, the project will study the key role theatre has played in the constitution of “the Turkish nation” and its Others. Staging National Abjection covers the period from the rise of European-style theatre in the Ottoman Empire in the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Using both mainstream and alternative archives and ethnographic research methods, the project will investigate topics of vital importance that have received limited academic attention: theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide; negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas; Islamic theatre in Turkey and its European diasporas; Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe; and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. These case studies will bring different perspectives to the issue of national abjection, and provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre responding to pressures of a conservative neoliberal government. Using the case of Turkey as a vantage point, this project will ask critical questions of broader theoretical significance about the role of theatre in regulating the politics of belonging in the nation-state, and about the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. This research will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, advance our understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and provide ground-breaking insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.",
