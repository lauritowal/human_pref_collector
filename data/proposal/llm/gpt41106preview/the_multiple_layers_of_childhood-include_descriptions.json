        "**Abstract:**\n\nAddressing health inequality, a pressing societal issue with roots in childhood, requires a comprehensive understanding of adversity across multiple domains. Existing research has predominantly focused on social adversity, neglecting the multifaceted nature of challenges faced by disadvantaged children. This proposal introduces an ambitious project, LAYERS, which aims to fill this critical knowledge gap by constructing a comprehensive data infrastructure for analyzing the impact of diverse adversities on health outcomes. The project will leverage data from 2 million individuals spanning three generations, thereby enabling life course analyses that incorporate biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental factors.\n\nLAYERS represents a pioneering approach by integrating cutting-edge techniques from various disciplines—data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science—within an innovative complex systems framework. This multidisciplinary fusion will facilitate the exploration of early-life patterns of health inequality, the underlying mechanisms, and their temporal dynamics. Insights gained will have profound implications for understanding how health disparities are perpetuated and evolve over time.\n\nTo ensure the translation of research findings into tangible public health strategies, LAYERS will also include the establishment of a policy data lab. This lab will synthesize evidence from national policies and simulations, creating a bridge between academic research and policy-making. The outcome of this project is expected to reshape the landscape of health inequality research by providing a holistic view of the adversities that contribute to lifelong and intergenerational disparities. By identifying at-risk children and families, LAYERS will be instrumental in developing targeted interventions, thereby helping to interrupt the cycle of adversity and promote equity in health from early life onwards."

Childhood is a sensitive period with rapid growth and development, and adversity during this period may have long-lasting health effects. More importantly, multiple forms of adversity intersect with each other, and disadvantaged children are often exposed to adversity across multiple biological, health, social, neighbourhood and environmental layers, but the childhood adversity literature has almost exclusively focused on social adversity. This is a major gap in our understanding, and empirical data which transcends multitude layers of adversity and follows individuals over entire life courses or across generations is lacking. With LAYERS, I am in a unique position to meet this challenge by creating a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of multiple layers of childhood adversity in 2M people over three generations combined with an interdisciplinary fusion of methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a newly developed complex systems framework. This innovative combination of data and methods will allow for a systematic generation of knowledge on the patterns of health inequality that emerge in early life and transcend generations, the mechanisms which generate these patterns, and the dynamics that make them change over time. To translate these insights into actionable public health, LAYERS will establish a real-world policy data lab which integrates evidence from nationwide policies and simulations. Combined, these interconnected elements will redirect the next frontier in health inequality research towards the multiple layers of adversity which generate inequality over the life course and across generations. Ultimately, this will help us break vicious circles of adversity by identifying children and families who would benefit from targeted support.",
