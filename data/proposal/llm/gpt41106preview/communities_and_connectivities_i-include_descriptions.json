        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe COMMIOS project seeks funding to embark on an unprecedented interdisciplinary exploration of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) and their European connections, harnessing revolutionary techniques in ancient DNA and isotope analysis. This initiative aims to conduct a pioneering genome-wide ancient DNA study of approximately 1,250 individuals from Britain and Europe—the first of its kind globally for Iron Age populations. By mapping genetic clusters, the project will illuminate the characteristics of ancient populations and their links to present-day genetic patterns. In conjunction with isotope analysis, and supported by osteoarchaeological and cultural archaeological methodologies, COMMIOS will delve into the complexities of population movement and inter-regional connectivity during the Iron Age.\n\nThe research will leverage cutting-edge scientific methods to investigate the structure and societal dynamics of these ancient societies, exploring aspects such as household composition, kinship, gender-specific mobility patterns, and the evolution of social hierarchies. By translating questions traditionally confined to cultural anthropology of contemporary societies into the realm of archaeology, the project will pioneer new avenues of inquiry into prehistoric social organization.\n\nCOMMIOS stands to redefine European archaeology, enabled by the maturation of advanced analytical techniques—many of which have been developed by the project's leading experts in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology. While concentrated on Iron Age Britain, the project's outcome will set a new standard for the analysis of ancient societies, offering a model that can be replicated for other regions and time periods across Europe and potentially worldwide."

COMMIOS integrates these cutting-edge methods on a scale not previously attempted, within a ground-breaking interdisciplinary framework, to provide a radically new vision of Iron Age communities in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) within their wider European context. At the broad scale, we will conduct the first concerted programme of genome-wide ancient DNA analysis on Iron Age populations anywhere in the world (c. 1000 individuals in the UK, 250 in Europe), mapping genetic clusters to shed light on ancient populations themselves and on their relationships to modern genetic patterning. Together with isotope analysis, and underpinned by both osteoarchaeological and cultural archaeological approaches, this will also enable us to directly address critical issues of population movement and inter-regional connectivity in Iron Age Europe. We will utilise the power of these new scientific methods to examine the structure and social dynamics of Iron Age societies in Britain, including household and kin-group composition, the identification of familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. Previously the preserve of cultural anthropologists studying recent societies, we will draw these questions into the archaeological domain, opening up new areas of enquiry for prehistoric societies. The scope and scale of the project represents a new departure for European archaeology, made possible by the coming-of-age of new analytical methods. Many of these have been pioneered by the project team, which comprises world-leaders in the fields of ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling and cultural archaeology. Although focussed on Iron Age Britain, the project will establish a new benchmark for future analyses of other regions and periods in Europe and beyond.",
