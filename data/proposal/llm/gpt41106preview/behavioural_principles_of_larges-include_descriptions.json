        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"PRINCIPLES: An Interdisciplinary Framework for Understanding Global Cooperation\"**\n\nThis proposal outlines an innovative interdisciplinary research program aimed at addressing a critical question in the face of global challenges such as climate change and pandemics: What motivates individuals to cooperate on a large scale for the collective good? Traditional behavioral models in the social sciences, including economics, provide an incomplete picture, as they often dissect human behavior into isolated factors without recognizing the concurrent motivations at play. To overcome these limitations, this program seeks to integrate insights and methodologies from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to forge a unified science of human cooperation.\n\nThe cornerstone of this research program is the development and experimental validation of a comprehensive model that delineates the behavioral principles of cooperation. Rule-following behavior will serve as the initial focus, laying the groundwork for a broader examination of cooperation. Subsequently, the program will explore the behavioral connections between previously segregated principles, as identified in various social science disciplines. The model will also offer new behavioral analyses of key social dilemma models, underpinning a deeper understanding of cooperation dynamics.\n\nThe final stage of the project will apply this framework to representative samples from major global economies, examining behaviors in pertinent cooperation scenarios, such as climate action, through incentivized experiments. The expected outcome is a robust, experimentally tested framework named PRINCIPLES, which will provide researchers and policymakers with valuable behavioral principles, tools, and data. This resource will revolutionize the study of cooperation challenges, enabling evidence-based decisions and interventions designed to foster collective action for the betterment of society and the environment."

A failure to cooperate, that is, to act in one’s self-interest rather than the collective interest, could spell a bleak future for humanity. When are people prepared to play their part in the solution of these fundamental problems? Current behavioural models of cooperation from across the social sciences, including economics, are inadequate for answering this fundamental question, because they typically focus on one narrow aspect of people’s behaviour, but people might be motivated by different factors at the same time. Hence, to make progress, an integrated approach is needed. The major ambition of my interdisciplinary research programme is to achieve synergy by combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology into a novel experimentally tested framework thereby making a major step forward in the creation of a unified science of human cooperation. Rule following is the most basic behaviour to achieve large-scale cooperation. I will use it as a first step to develop, and experimentally test a comprehensive model of behavioural principles of cooperation. Second, I will then employ the framework to systematically investigate behavioural links between previously disjointed behavioural principles as developed across the social sciences. I also use the model to provide comprehensive new behavioural analyses of the most important models of social dilemmas. Finally, I will use the new framework in representative samples from major economies around the globe to explain people’s behaviour in relevant large-scale cooperation problems, most importantly caring for the climate, by using incentivised experiments. PRINCIPLES will equip researchers and policy makers across disciplines with behavioural principles, tools and data to study problems of cooperation using an interdisciplinary and experimentally tested framework.",
