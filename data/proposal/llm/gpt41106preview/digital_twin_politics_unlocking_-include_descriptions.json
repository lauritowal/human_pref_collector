    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe advancement of ocean science and governance is critical to addressing the mounting pressure to achieve global sustainability goals for ocean protection. In response to this, the European Commission is pioneering the development of a prototype digital twin of the ocean (DTO), a high-tech knowledge infrastructure that transforms vast ocean data into predictive tools. This infrastructure is crucial for informed decision-making among various stakeholders committed to sustainable ocean futures. The proposed research project, TwinPolitics, aims to address the multifaceted challenges and political dimensions associated with the development and implementation of DTOs. \n\nTwinPolitics will critically examine the socio-technical construction of DTOs for scientific and political purposes at the national level and the politics surrounding their development and use internationally. The project recognizes that the capacity to develop, utilize, and access ocean data is unevenly distributed, potentially exacerbating global inequalities. It also identifies the need for careful consideration of legal, political, and security concerns related to data access, ownership, and sharing. Furthermore, TwinPolitics will explore how DTOs can be integrated within a framework of norms, rules, and values to prevent their abuse and misuse.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, TwinPolitics will introduce an innovative methodological approach that synergizes qualitative and quantitative research. This approach will investigate the practices, policies, and politics governing digital twins in specific national and regional contexts, such as the EU, USA, and China, while also assessing their role and impact during multilateral negotiations. By reconceptualizing digital twins as socio-technical entities influenced by institutional, political, and economic conditions within a hybrid environment of research, data, and observation, TwinPolitics endeavors to break new ground in understanding the implications of DTOs and guide their responsible development and use for the betterment of global ocean governance."

The EU DTO is part of a larger set of substantial global and national efforts to develop highly accurate digital models of the ocean for ‘better decision-making’ and an emerging high-tech knowledge infrastructure that turns various types of ocean data into prediction tools for public and private actors with a stake in the transition towards sustainable ocean futures. However, DTOs, although needed to advance ocean science and governance, are a political issue in themselves. Firstly, DTOs run the risk of perpetuating global inequalities because the capacities to develop, access, and use ocean data, information, and science are unequally distributed. Secondly, DTOs may create an array of legal and political uncertainties regarding data access, ownership, security, and sharing. Thirdly, DTOs should be embedded into a set of norms, rules, and values to prevent abuse and misuse in practice — a neglected aspect in the current ‘twin rush’. TwinPolitics will overcome shortcomings in the study of DTOs by examining both the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes and the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting. TwinPolitics will re-conceptualise digital twins as socio-technical relations operating under a specific set of institutional, political, and economic conditions and within a hybrid research, data, and observation environment. TwinPolitics will break new ground by developing a methodological approach that combines, on the one hand, qualitative and quantitative research on the practices, policies, and politics presiding over digital twins in national/regional contexts (EU, USA, China) with, on the other hand, the study of DTO use during multilateral negotiations.",
