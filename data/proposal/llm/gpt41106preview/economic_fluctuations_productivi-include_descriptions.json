        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to bridge the traditional divide in macroeconomic literature between business cycles and long-run productivity growth by developing an integrative Keynesian growth framework. Recognizing the interplay between economic fluctuations, productivity dynamics, and policy interventions, the proposed research is particularly relevant in the context of post-Great Recession policy debates.\n\nThe research is structured into three parts. Part I will introduce a pioneering Keynesian growth model featuring heterogeneous firms, informed by the latest advancements in quantitative endogenous growth theory. This model will be a tool to explore the influence of monetary and fiscal policies on productivity growth, to dissect productivity behavior during major financial crises-induced recessions, and to examine the potential for sustained periods of economic stagnation due to adverse expectations.\n\nIn Part II, the research will extend to an open economy context, offering a Keynesian growth model that elucidates the complex relationships among monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth. This segment will specifically address the economic phenomena observed following the establishment of the euro, including the surge in capital flows and the resultant productivity stagnation in certain eurozone countries.\n\nPart III will empirically test the central hypothesis of the Keynesian growth framework, which posits that productivity growth is reactive to both business cycle fluctuations and policy measures. Empirical analysis will focus on the United States and a panel of advanced economies, aiming to quantify the response of productivity growth to various policy and cyclical shocks.\n\nThe proposed research promises to provide significant insights into the mechanisms linking short-term economic dynamics and long-term productivity trends, with implications for policy formulation aimed at fostering sustainable economic growth. The results are expected to be of high interest to policymakers, academics, and institutions concerned with macroeconomic stability and progress."

Yet, the interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth and stabilization policies are well present in the policy debate, especially since the start of the Great Recession. In this proposal, I will develop a Keynesian growth framework to study business cycles and growth in a unified theory. The framework combines the Keynesian insight that fluctuations might be driven by changes in aggregate demand, with the notion, developed by the endogenous growth literature, that productivity growth is the result of firmsâ€™ investment in innovation. In part I, I will develop a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms, in the spirit of the state-of-the-art quantitative endogenous growth literature. I will use the framework to study the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on productivity growth; to understand the behavior of productivity during large recessions triggered by financial crises, such as the recent Great Recession; and to investigate the possibility that pessimistic expectations might give rise to periods of stagnation. In part II, I will provide an open economy Keynesian growth model, able to capture the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows and productivity growth. I will use the framework to explain why the inception of the euro was associated with a sharp increase in capital flows across its member countries, and with stagnant productivity growth in countries recipients of capital inflows. In part III, I will test the hypothesis, at the heart of the Keynesian growth framework, that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and to monetary and fiscal policy interventions. To this end, I will estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to policy and business cycle shocks, both in the United States and in a panel of advanced economies.",
