        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious historical research project focused on uncovering the global and connected histories of Eastern Christians from the early modern period. In contrast to the commonly held perception that the diaspora of Eastern Christians is a purely modern phenomenon, the proposed study will illuminate how this migration began as early as the sixteenth century, with Christians from the Ottoman Empire dispersing to various regions including Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. The aim of the project is to consolidate and analyze a 'lost archive' of multilingual sources scattered across three continents and preserved in numerous archives, chanceries, and libraries.\n\nLed by a principal investigator (PI) with a track record of expertise, the project will utilize a team of researchers to meticulously collect and scrutinize literary, documentary, and printed materials in ten different languages from dozens of archival collections. This comprehensive assembly of sources will enable a pioneering examination of the lived experiences and global footprint of early modern Eastern Christians, effectively merging micro-historical insights with the broader narratives prevalent in global history scholarship. This approach seeks to address a critical methodological challenge within the field—integrating detailed philological investigation with overarching historical frameworks.\n\nThe project's dissemination plan is designed to bridge scholarly divides, connecting the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, while fostering academic discourse through print publications, workshops, and the creation of an accessible, searchable database. This database will catalog the writings of Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750, providing an invaluable resource for future research.\n\nBy tracing the transnational movements and influences of Eastern Christians during this formative period, the project will significantly contribute to the understanding of global history and the role of marginalized communities within it. The anticipated outputs will not only serve academic communities but also offer broader cultural and historical insights into a crucial and underexplored aspect of world history."

Too often, however, this global migration has been seen purely as a modern development, one arising from contemporary political and confessional events in the Middle East, while in fact this phenomenon had its roots in the early modern period. From the sixteenth century onwards, Christians from the Ottoman Empire set out for distant worlds and foreign lands, travelling as far as Europe, India, Russia, and even the Americas and leaving traces of themselves across countless European and Middle Eastern archives, chanceries, and libraries. This transnational, ground-breaking project will gather all of these disparate sources into a single analytical frame to uncover, for the first time, the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Through the work of a team of researchers under the close supervision of the PI, the project will reconstitute and analyse a ‘lost archive’ of literary, documentary, and printed sources in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of archives. Under the expert leadership of the PI, the project will include a robust strategy for dissemination, which will successfully bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history. In doing so, this project will respond directly to one of the most pressing conceptual challenges facing global history today, that is, how to link the study of the micro-scale level of everyday life to the macro-narratives emphasised by global historians. Underlying this project, therefore, is a major intervention that seeks to advance a rigorous form of global history, and one which preserves philology and source criticism at the heart of its methodology. The outcomes of the project will include print-publications, workshops, and a searchable database of all writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750.",
