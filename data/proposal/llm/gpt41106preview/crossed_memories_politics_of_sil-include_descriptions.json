        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to fund CROME, a pioneering research project aimed at unraveling the complex memoryscape of the colonial-liberation wars between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. Addressing the plural memories, conflicting evocations, and persistent amnesias associated with these conflicts, CROME employs a diachronic and comparative methodology to examine the evolving remembrance and silencing of these wars and their legacies in Portugal and its former African colonies: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe.\n\nCROME is structured around two main strands: 'Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States' and 'Memory as a battlefield.' The former investigates state roles in shaping, mobilizing, and acknowledging historical narratives, as well as crafting selective representations. The latter focuses on the interplay between social and individual memories, dissecting the various appropriations of the past. The project hypothesizes that the wars—as epochal events marking the end of Portuguese imperialism and the onset of African independence—sparked distinctive processes of memorialization and silencing with their historicity.\n\nBy examining the multiple memories and conflicting historical judgments primarily in Portugal, and the unique postcolonial trajectories of each African nation shaping their engagement with war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies, CROME aims to offer a novel perspective in colonial-liberation war studies. The project's comparative approach promises to contribute significantly to understanding and potentially overcoming the lingering consequences of European colonialism. CROME's research outcomes are expected to be instrumental in addressing the traumatic experiences of these wars, facilitating a broader comprehension of their enduring impact on contemporary societies."

The project’s main challenge is to produce innovative knowledge about the memories of the wars fought by the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements between 1961 and 1974/5. The approach chosen is simultaneously diachronic and comparative, inasmuch as it contrasts changes that took place between the end of the conflicts and nowadays, regarding how wars, colonial pasts and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that wars - as pivotal moments that ended the cycle of Empire in Portugal and started the cycle of African independences in the former Portuguese colonies - triggered memorialisation and silencing processes which had their own historicity. CROME is divided into two strands. The first one, named ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States’, looks at the role played by the states under consideration in mobilising, articulating and recognising the past, but also in actively generating selective representations. ‘Memory as a battlefield’ is the second strand, which will highlight distinct uses of the past and dynamics between social memories and individual memories. The project intends to demonstrate how wars gave rise to multiple memories and conflicting historical judgements, mostly in Portugal, but also to examine how the specific nature of the (post-)colonial histories of each African country has generated different ways to summon war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies. CROME will, thus, put forward a ground-breaking perspective in terms of colonial-liberation war studies, and will be instrumental in dealing with such traumatic experience, for its comparative approach might help overcoming everlasting constraints still at play today, caused by the historical burden European colonialism left behind.",
