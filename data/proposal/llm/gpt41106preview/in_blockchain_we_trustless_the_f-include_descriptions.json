        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe decline in confidence within liberal democracies signals a pressing need to examine emerging technologies that challenge traditional governance mechanisms. BlockchainGov represents an ambitious interdisciplinary research initiative poised to critically assess the role of blockchain technology in transforming governance structures. This project is situated at the intersection of computer science, political science, and law, and seeks to answer whether blockchain can genuinely distribute power or if it inadvertently centralizes authority in new, unaccountable ways.\n\nOur investigation is fourfold. Firstly, we will scrutinize the internal governance of extant blockchain systems to elucidate the power relations they harbor. Secondly, the project will interrogate the legitimacy and viability of current decentralized governance experiments, integrating legal and political theoretical perspectives. Thirdly, we propose to investigate blockchain's capacity to sustain novel, distributed governance frameworks that enhance decision-making through augmented transparency and accountability. Finally, the project will test these innovative models across various governance scales, from local communities to international institutions.\n\nBlockchainGov aims to pioneer the nascent field of \"distributed governance\" research, offering substantial empirical and theoretical advancements. This endeavour is crucial for science and has significant policy ramifications concerning global governance discourse. The project's success hinges on securing a funding source that appreciates the inherent risks and potential rewards of cutting-edge research and is willing to invest in a dedicated, interdisciplinary team to navigate this complex, evolving landscape."

Often described as a “trustless” technology, blockchain’s potential for disintermediation has been touted as a catalyst of innovation that could displace existing power structures. But is it shifting power away from former centers of power only to create new ones, or can it lead to an actual new organisation of power? BlockchainGov is an interdisciplinary project that will study the impact of blockchain technology on new and existing governance structures, and its consequences for legitimacy and trust. First, it will investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, and analyse the power dynamics at play within these systems. Second, it will examine the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of existing attempts at distributed governance, through the lenses of legal and political theory. Third, it will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new models of distributed governance providing an architecture for decentralized and participatory decision-making with attributes of transparency and accountability. Last, it will experiment with these new models at different levels of governance, from the community level to the global governance level. The project will open a new field of scholarship on “distributed governance” that uniquely combines the disciplines of computer science, political science and law. It will provide key empirical and theoretical contributions to science, with important policy implications to the broader questions of global governance. Bringing this project to life requires a funding scheme compatible with a high-risk/high-gain vision to finance a fully dedicated and highly motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills.",
