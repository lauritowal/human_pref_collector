        "**Abstract:**\n\nFamine remains a critical global issue, with statistics from 2022 indicating that a quarter of a million people faced famine conditions and an additional 35 million were at the brink of starvation. While scholarship traditionally posits famine as a consequence of political failure rather than natural calamity, the underlying question of why famines persist despite this knowledge remains unanswered. This research proposal seeks to pioneer a paradigm shift in the study of famine politics by examining the micro-level, everyday politics of famine within affected communities. The project aims to explore how famine discourses become normalized, thus averting political crises, and how these narratives may deflect accountability from governments and other influential actors, attributing responsibility to natural phenomena or the victims themselves.\n\nTo investigate these dynamics, the proposed research will undertake an ethnographically-informed comparative study in South Sudan and Somalia, integrating insights from initial fieldwork. The study will be structured around four thematic strands: the oral histories and musical recollections of past famines; community narratives that reinforce social bonds; practices surrounding burial and remembrance of the deceased; and the impact of media on anti-famine discourse. This approach promises to deliver innovative contributions to our understanding of famine normalization and the shifting of blame in famine politics.\n\nThe feasibility of this ambitious project is underpinned by my previous experience, established networks, and the capability of a research team primarily composed of Somali and South Sudanese scholars. This team's unique composition and expertise provide a robust foundation for executing the research and ensuring the production of significant and policy-relevant findings that could inform strategies to create a political culture where famine is deemed unacceptable, ultimately contributing to the eradication of famines globally."

For decades there has been a scholarly consensus that famine is the result of political failure or design, and never solely the result of natural disasters. However, a political culture that makes famine politically unconscionable and that ends famine has not emerged. To understand why famines persist we need to deepen our understanding of famine politics; so far scholarship on the politics of famine has focus on national and international institutions, and the instrumental use of famine by actors and institutions. My research will produce a ground-breaking shift in the science of famine politics by focusing on the everyday politics of famine in communities where it occurs. I am interested in how discourses and the ‘regime of truth’ about famine disperse throughout the social body (in Foucault’s words). In particular, I am interested in how new deadly famines come to be normalised, preventing political rupture. Plus, I am interested in how these discourses can shift blame for famine suffering away from governments, warring parties and actors in global economies, and instead place blame on natural causes and the families of those who suffer and die. To achieve this, I will conduct an ethnographically-informed comparative study across four sites in South Sudan and in Somalia. Initial ethnographic insights have made me structure the research around four cross-case-study research strands: histories and musical memories of past famine; community-narratives that enforce social networks; burial and posthumous practices; and media and social media’s role in anti-famine politics. This ambitious project is feasible because of my previous experience and networks, and because I have carefully built the capacity and track record of a team Somali and South Sudanese – dominated research team.",
