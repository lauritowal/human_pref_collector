        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the wake of over a decade of devastating urban terrorist attacks across Europe, the challenge of responding to and understanding these events remains critical. UrbTerr emerges as a pioneering research initiative aimed at conducting the first comprehensive comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany—nations profoundly affected by this scourge of violence. This project leverages interdisciplinary methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology to scrutinize and document the multifaceted narratives that have emerged in the aftermath of these attacks.\n\nUrbTerr's objectives are threefold: firstly, it will examine the collective processes of remembering, forgetting, and envisaging that have influenced the reconfiguration of urban landscapes in the wake of terror incidents; secondly, it will introduce a novel materialist perspective on terrorism to critically evaluate the response strategies and physical security infrastructures implemented at both local and European scales; and thirdly, it will harness the transformative power of performance art to explore and instigate alternative modes of commemoration and future-oriented thinking.\n\nThe project's anticipated outcomes are extensive and varied, encompassing the launch of an informative website featuring interviews with a diverse range of stakeholders, the publication of academic monographs and journal articles, the production of two PhD theses, and the curation of a co-edited academic volume. Additionally, the project will engage the public through a series of compelling performances by the ‘Center for Political Beauty,’ designed to ignite critical discourse on the implications of securitization within contemporary Europe. Through its multifaceted approach, UrbTerr aims to reshape the conversation around urban terrorism, moving beyond conventional paradigms towards a more inclusive and creative understanding of memory and resilience."

Whilst trying to come to terms with recent acts of urban terrorism, governments, security agencies, and local communities are bracing themselves for further attacks. UrbTerr will offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in four European countries that have suffered particularly as a result of this wave of violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Drawing on concepts and methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory and anthropology, UrbTerr will document and analyse a range of voices in contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe and problematise the narrow concept of imagination and creativity underpinning recent counter-terrorism measures and a great part of the academic literature on this subject. It will: (1) analyse the collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining that have shaped urban spaces in the four countries after recent terrorist attacks; (2) develop a new materialist approach to terrorism and use this framework to critically assess policies and material security infrastructures that were created in response to these attacks at a local and European level; (3) use performance art as a creative tool to develop and experiment with alternative forms of remembering and different visions of the future. Outputs of the project will include a website with footage of interviews with city residents, politicians, architects, political activists, and other key actors, as well as other resources for terrorism research, two academic monographs, articles in peer-reviewed journals, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of thought-provoking public performances by the art group ‘Center for Political Beauty’ that will spark critical debates about securitization processes in contemporary Europe.",
