        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses a critical gap in the study of Charitable Food Provision (CFP) amidst growing concerns of food insecurity in urban populations. While food charities have become increasingly vital following the Great Recession, particularly in light of sustainable food surplus use and reduced welfare benefits, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks for understanding and comparing CFP across different international contexts. The proposed research seeks to fill this void by offering a comparative analysis of CFP trajectories and dynamics within diverse welfare and civil society regimes and examining the impact of sustainable agri-food transitions on CFP.\n\nThe project has three primary objectives: first, to trace the historical development of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands through event sequence analysis, highlighting the evolution of professionalized CFP sectors amidst varying institutional settings. Second, it aims to utilize mixed-methods social network analysis to explore current CFP dynamics in the cities of Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. This will involve an in-depth examination of the relationships among CFP providers, their operational strategies, and their interactions with state and non-state actors. Third, the proposal intends to conduct urban ethnography to delve into the reliance on CFP as part of the survival strategies of the urban poor.\n\nAn innovative element of this research is the development of a tool for city workshops to enable real-time data collection on CFP urban dynamics. The integration of these methodologies will result in a comprehensive framework that can be applied to further extend CFP comparisons to other global contexts. This research promises to contribute significantly to the fields of urban studies, sustainability, organizational behavior, food systems, and social policy by providing novel insights into the interplay between food support systems and food insecurity."

Their significance, particularly after the Great Recession, is underscored by two pivotal shifts: one towards the sustainable utilisation of food surplus and waste reduction, and the other reflecting societal changes with diminishing welfare benefit provision. While considerable research addresses food insecurity and support, the literature lacks a robust framework to understand and compare Charitable Food Provision (CFP) across countries and cities. Despite the almost universal occurrence of such transitions, existing studies have not yet contextualised this phenomenon within the diverse arrangements of welfare and civil society regimes, and the influence of transitions in agri-food sustainability on CFP. Accordingly, this proposal aims to: 1. Use event sequence analysis to chart the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, examining the emergence and consolidation of professionalised CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings. 2. Adopt mixed-methods social network analysis to examine current CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, focusing on providers interrelationships, operational modes, and their ties with both state and non-state authorities. 3. Harness urban ethnography to investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support to understand how CFP becomes part of poor peopleâ€™s survival strategies. Additionally, it introduces an innovative tool, tailored for city workshops, to facilitate real-time data collection on (CFP) urban dynamics. Hence, it combines the findings obtained by crafting an overarching framework to extend CFP comparison to other countries and cities. The research will create new knowledge across urban, sustainability, organisation, food, and social policy studies, offering an innovative, comparative insight into food support and insecurity.",
