        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal advocates for a paradigm shift in the study of language comprehension and production, challenging the prevalent alphabet-centric perspective shaped by the Western linguistic tradition. While the historical focus has been on words and phonemes as fundamental linguistic units, this project posits that languages may instead utilize the low-level properties of acoustic signals to convey and decode messages. The proposed research builds on preliminary findings from experiments with wide learning networks—large two-layer networks employing a rudimentary error-driven learning rule—that show striking parallels between network performance and human language processing. These networks demonstrate proficiency in reading and speech comprehension tasks that mirror both the capabilities and limitations inherent in human cognition. In an era marked by the rapid advancements of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is critical to develop models that accurately reflect human information processing. The proposed research aims to expand upon these initial results by enhancing our understanding of auditory comprehension, incorporating a wider range of typologically diverse languages, exploring speech production, and formulating a discrimination-based language theory. Funding is sought to enable the progression of this groundbreaking research agenda, which promises to redefine our understanding of linguistic structure and challenge long-standing assumptions in the field. This innovative approach holds the potential to not only revolutionize linguistic theory but also inform the development of more human-like artificial intelligence systems."

Training in literacy starts in early childhood, and because of this, words and letter-like sound units can naturally seem to be the building blocks of language. The Chinese writing system highlights the cultural-specificity of this approach: characters are juxtaposed without intervening spaces, and their interpretation is highly context-dependent. Words are not singled out. And although more frequent characters contain parts indicating pronunciation, it is syllables that are referred to, not letter-like sound units. The research proposed here seeks to break the hold that the alphabet-centric approach has on our understanding of language by exploring the idea that instead of being phone and word-based, languages use low-level properties of the acoustic signal to directly reduce uncertainty about the messages encoded in the speech signal. My work with wide learning networks (two-layer networks with many thousands of units, using the simplest possible error-driven learning rule) provides remarkable support for this suggestion: For reading and speech comprehension, their performance closely matches both the strengths and the weaknesses of human processing. Especially at a time when machine learning and artificial intelligence are moving beyond human capacity, it is a methodological imperative to study and work with algorithms reflecting both the advantages and disadvantages of human learning. I am requesting funding to take this radically novel research program to the next level by further developing our account of auditory comprehension, by modeling more typologically diverse languages, by extending this approach to speech production, and by developing a discrimination-based language theory.",
