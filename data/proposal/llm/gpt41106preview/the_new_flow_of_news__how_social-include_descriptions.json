    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the context of the rapidly evolving news landscape, where traditional media consumption wanes in favor of social network sites (SNSs), this project seeks to investigate the transformation of news into a social product and its ramifications on news production and political engagement. The proposed research introduces a novel model based on network logic, focusing on the triad of news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees. News organizations are adapting their content to the sharing-oriented environment of SNSs, while news feeders act as curators, influencing the dissemination of news stories within their online networks. News feedees primarily access news curated by their connections, potentially affecting their political beliefs and actions.\n\nThe study will employ a suite of innovative methodologies, some being used in media and political studies for the first time. Through a blend of 'big data' analytics and small-N in-depth studies, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the news industry's adaptation to SNSs. Investigative methods include interviews with news editors, traffic and content analysis of news organizations, and a laboratory observation to assess users' online behavior and attention through physiological indices. Additionally, the research will examine long-term political effects by analyzing survey panel data and web-based behavioral information over a two-year span.\n\nThe proposed research is poised to make significant theoretical and empirical contributions. It will offer a fresh conceptualization of news distribution and its influence on consumer behavior. Moreover, it promises to set a new methodological benchmark in audience research, enhancing our understanding of the interplay between news consumption on SNSs and political engagement in the digital age."

To accommodate this trend, news industry has been incorporating SNSs into its platforms, changing news into a social product. The project will explore this process and reveal its implications for news production and audiences’ political behavior. I develop a new model anchored in network logic and involving three key actors in news creation and distribution: news organizations, which are adapting news production to the logic of sharing; news feeders – users who select and disseminate news stories, thereby serving as a bridge between their online followers and news organizations; and news feedees – individuals whose news consumption is limited to stories fetched for them by feeders in their SNSs. The model points to some long-term effects on individuals' political beliefs and behavior as a consequence of acting as feeders or feedees. Multiple innovative methods will be employed, some of which will be implemented in the field of media and political studies for the first time. The methods are mutually complementary, combining ‘big data’ analysis with small-N in-depth designs. To study news organizations, I will interview news editors and analyze traffic data juxtaposing it against content analysis. To study users’ behavior and identify feeders and feedees, I will conduct a laboratory observation in which surfing behavior and physiological attention indices will be measured unobtrusively. Long-term political effects will be tested using a combination of survey panel data and web-based behavioral data spanning a period of two years. The proposal is theoretically and empirically innovative and can impact future research by providing novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption and influence, as well as by introducing a new methodological ‘golden standard’ to audience research.",
