        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES) aims to address the critical gap in international law regarding the allocation of responsibility among multiple actors engaging in cooperative efforts towards common international objectives, such as environmental conservation and the prevention of mass atrocities. This initiative recognizes the challenge in attributing responsibility in a landscape where collaboration dilutes the individual accountability of each participant, potentially jeopardizing the protection of the international rule of law and the provision of remedies to injured parties.\n\nThe current framework of individual responsibility fails to offer adequate conceptual tools for dealing with shared responsibilities, a significant oversight given the increasing prevalence of international cooperation. SHARES proposes to investigate the scope and implications of the dispersal of international responsibilities within cooperative contexts and to develop innovative perspectives for aligning such cooperation with a fitting system of international responsibility.\n\nThe project will advance its objectives through two synergistic tracks: the exploration of principles and the examination of processes. In terms of principles, SHARES will investigate models for assigning collective, joint, or proportionate responsibility among various actors. Regarding processes, the project will reconsider how (quasi-)judicial mechanisms might more effectively reflect the collective dimension of states' and other actors' international policies.\n\nThrough a combination of conceptual, theoretical, and empirical methodologies, including case studies, SHARES seeks to enhance our comprehension of the principles and processes necessary to reconcile the growing trend of international cooperation with an equitable system of shared responsibility. This project not only aims to fill a critical void in international law scholarship but also seeks to inform policy-making and judicial practice in international affairs."

International cooperation may complicate attempts to determine who is responsible for what. SHARES is based on the unrecognized and unexplored fact that as the responsibility for policies is shared among more actors, the discrete responsibility of every individual actor is diminished proportionately. International cooperation paradoxically may undermine the key objectives of any scheme of responsibility : the protection of the international rule of law and the provision of remedies of injured parties. The dominant principle of individual responsibility, and the scholarship based on it, provides us neither with the concepts nor the perspectives for addressing shared responsibilities. SHARES will uncover the extent and nature of the problem of scattering of international responsibilities in cases of international cooperation and will provide fresh perspectives on how cooperation can be better matched by a corresponding system of international responsibility. It will pursue two interlocking tracks, focussing on principles and processes of international responsibility. As to principles, it will examine the possibility of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly or proportionately responsible. As to processes, SHARES will rethink how (quasi-)judicial processes may better taken into account the collective context of the international policies of states and other actors. SHARES will complement a conceptual and theoretical foundation with a thorough empirical approach, exploring through case-studies how we can improve our understanding of the principles and processes that are needed to match the unprecedented international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility.",
