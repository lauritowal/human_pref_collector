        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the RELEVEN project, an innovative research initiative aimed at enhancing the utility of digital historical data for scholars by pioneering new methods of data creation and curation. Focusing on a methodologically complex segment of medieval history, the project seeks to transform both existing and newly acquired historical data into a network of verifiable assertions, each linked to a specific authority. This framework recognizes the inherently disputable nature of pre-modern historical data and allows for nuanced manipulation and interconnection of assertions based on their corroborative, dependent, or conflicting relationships.\n\nCentral to RELEVEN's methodology is the acknowledgement that in the realm of history, particularly that of the pre-modern era, straightforward and uncontested facts are rare. The project confronts this challenge by introducing a system where data is not merely presented as static information, but as dynamic elements linked to their sources, enabling historians to evaluate the data based on their origin and reliability.\n\nFurthermore, the project addresses the need to contextualize and repurpose existing online data pertaining to the late 11th century (circa 1030–1095), to maximize its value and prevent obsolescence. By applying a broad, trans-regional perspective to this era—predominantly within the eastern domains of Christendom, yet also inclusive of interactions with central European kingdoms—the research aims to uncover and articulate overarching trends of communication and contact that have been overshadowed by more localized narratives.\n\nLeveraging a wealth of digital scholarship and resources from various sub-disciplines, including prosopography, textual studies, and archaeology, RELEVEN will provide historians with a multi-faceted view of history, transcending traditional, region-centric narratives. The project promises to redefine the understanding of this pivotal century, paving the way for new insights into the interconnectivity and complexity of historical phenomena."

The approach is to re-frame both existing and new historical data as assertions, often sourced but always linked to an authority; this allows data to be manipulated according to source and authority, and also allows assertions themselves to be linked depending on whether they corroborate, depend on, or conflict with each other. The novel aspect of this methodology is that it takes to its logical conclusion something that historians all readily acknowledge and that is especially apparent for pre-modern history: that there are very few, if any, simple and undisputed facts. A related challenge is the contextualisation and reuse of existing online data for the period, to avoid its going to waste. The approach is tested by taking a broad trans-regional approach to the history of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), centred broadly in the eastern half of Christendom but incorporating developments elsewhere, especially in the newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The looming weight of the First Crusade at the century's end means that while certain regional or proto-national narratives—particularly for western Europe—are well-developed, they tend to obscure the larger trans-regional trends of communication and contact, particularly in eastern Christendom. By drawing upon the depth of scholarship and the plethora of digital resources that have emerged for this period in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, and by framing this scholarship in terms of assertions whose authority is traceable, it will become possible to look at the history not just from \"the eastern perspective\", but from several.",
