        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive socio-historical research project aimed at elucidating the transformation in health governance post-World War II, shifting from an international public health regime to the current global health paradigm. Anchored in the context of globalization, this study will dissect the evolution of knowledge production, health good commercialization, public health program implementation, and routine medical practice changes. The project will probe into the dynamics of four specific fields: tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics, to unravel the processes through which various elements have integrated into the global health governance fabric.\n\nA dual historical and anthropological methodology will guide the investigation across international and local arenas, with a keen interest in the evolving role of the World Health Organization (WHO) and health developments in non-Western contexts, particularly in India. The research aims to yield a multifaceted understanding of health governance by engaging with diverse social worlds, such as laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. Emphasis will be placed on interpreting the global landscape as an entity shaped by local actions and indigenous knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, the study will challenge traditional North-South discourse, instead exploring varied levels of knowledge and practice circulations. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide insights into the transition from a Cold War political and economic framework to a neo-liberal, multi-centric era marked by uncertainty. The outcomes of this research will significantly contribute to the historical and anthropological fields, offering a more nuanced understanding of global health's trajectory and its socio-political underpinnings."

The project seeks to understand this transition in terms of globalization processes, looking at the making of knowledge, the production and commercialization of health goods, the implementation of public health programs, and routine medical work. It will focus on four fields of investigations: tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine and medical genetics in order to understand how categories, standardized treatment regimens, industrial products, management tools or specific specialties have become elements in the global government of health. The project associates historical and anthropological investigations of practices in both international and local sites with strong interests in: a) the changing roles of WHO; b) the developments taking place in non-Western countries, India in the first place. The expected benefits of this research strategy are: a) to take into account social worlds including laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions and international organizations; b) to approach the global as something translated in and emerging from local practices and local knowledge; c) to explore different levels of circulations beyond the classical question of North-South transfers; d) to deepen our understanding of the transition from the political and economical order of the Cold War into a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty.",
