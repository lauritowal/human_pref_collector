        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the pressing question of why individuals opt for different forms of political engagement in varied democratic contexts, a phenomenon with significant implications for the health and evolution of democratic societies. In an era marked by both rising public protests and persistent political apathy, it is essential to probe the underlying factors that drive some citizens towards active participation, whether through conventional electoral politics or more contentious forms of expression. This research aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the motivations, organizational appeals, and societal constraints that influence an individual's decision to engage or disengage politically.\n\nThe proposed study adopts a comparative and multidisciplinary approach, integrating a robust theoretical framework with innovative methodological strategies to examine the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal dynamics in political participation. The project is structured around four interconnected subprojects: a meta-analysis of extant literature on movement and party politics; a comparative analysis of political participation trends utilizing global survey data; focus group discussions in a diverse array of democracies to unravel the processes of political engagement and disengagement; and experimental surveys designed to measure participation patterns across selected countries.\n\nBy comparing the political behavior of citizens in 'old' democracies (the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, U.S.A.), post-communist 'new' democracies (Hungary, Poland), and post-authoritarian 'new' democracies (Brazil, Argentina), the study endeavors to illuminate the universal and particularistic elements of political involvement. The findings promise to contribute significantly to the scholarly discourse on political action and to offer practical insights for policymakers and civil society actors dedicated to fostering a more engaged and responsive citizenry. Through this project, we aim to advance the collective understanding of democratic participation and to support the development of more inclusive and dynamic political environments worldwide."

Some argue that contentious politics gains importance and party politics declines. Is that so and why would that be? Why is it that some individuals engage in politics while others remain apathetic? Why is it that some citizens take the electoral route, while others engage in contentious politics? The truth is that we do not really know. Should we bother? I think we should. Citizens who are actively involved in politics are an asset to democracy. Understanding how and why people take part in politics would help to build more democratic societies. The proposed project compares participation in contentious and non-contentious politics in various countries within a single theoretical and methodological framework. A central tenet of this research proposal is that sooner or later every citizen might get involved in politics. I seek the reason why in the interplay of dynamics at the individual, the organizational, and the societal level. What are the motives people have? What are the appeals parties and movement organizations disseminate; and what are the opportunities and constraints regimes impose? Comparison is the core of the project. It encompasses four subproject: (1) a meta-analysis of publications on movement and party politics combined; (2) comparisons of political participation over time and countries in existing global survey data; (3) focus group discussions to understand the formation of political engagement and disengagement in four ‘old’ democracies (the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, U.S.A.), two post-communist ‘new’ democracies (Hungary, Poland) and two post-authoritarian ‘new’ democracies (Brazil, Argentina); (4) experimental focused surveys among 1000 respondents to quantify patterns of political participation in the same eight countries.",
