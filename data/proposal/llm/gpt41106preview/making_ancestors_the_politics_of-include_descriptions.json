        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to explore the intricate dynamics of politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe, challenging the conventional dichotomy that positions Neolithic societies as egalitarian and Bronze to Iron Age societies as structured by overt political stratification. Recent critiques suggest that traditional methods, which infer social hierarchies from burial treatments, oversimplify the past. This project proposes a novel empirical investigation into the nuanced manifestations of inequality in pre-state societies, which may not align with clear social strata but rather exist in a fluctuating balance with notions of equality.\n\nThe research will employ an innovative dual-methodological approach, integrating osteobiography and funerary taphonomy to reconstruct ancient life stories and understand deathways. Through osteobiographical analysis, the project aims to amass scientific data on individual identity, health, diet, mobility, and kinship from skeletal remains, thereby illuminating social relations during life. Funerary taphonomy will complement this by interpreting burial practices, providing insight into the political significance of the dead and their role within their communities.\n\nThe study focuses on Peninsular Italy, a region with an extensive archaeological record representative of broader European prehistory. A sample size of over 200 individuals from three critical periods—Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC)—will be analyzed to produce a comprehensive understanding of how inequality influenced lives across millennia and the extent to which ancestors were integral to these processes.\n\nThis project's outcomes are expected to revolutionize our comprehension of prehistoric European societies, providing a more accurate portrayal of the interplay between politics, inequality, and social identity. The findings hold the potential to rewrite narratives of prehistoric human organization and interaction, offering a significant contribution to the field of archaeology and related disciplines."

Traditionally, politics has been seen in terms of discrete political ranks identified through differential treatment of individual burials. But this results in classifying much of prehistory, where the dead were treated in ways which effaced individual identity, as egalitarian. The result is an artificially dichotomous history: Neolithic people had landscapes, rituals and ancestors, Bronze and Iron Age people had politics and inequality. In the last two decades this approach has been strongly critiqued. Burial treatment rarely relates to status so directly; the dead serve many different political roles. Inequality in pre-state groups rarely consists of clear strata; inequality and equality exist in tension within groups. Inequality may have been present throughout European prehistory, but manifest situationally through differential life chances, kinship, ritual or ancestorhood, rather than overtly through political command, wealth or identity. But this new perspective has never been tested empirically. This project tests alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways. To investigate social relations in life, it uses osteobiography, reconstructing life stories from skeletons through scientific data on identity, health, diet, mobility and kinship. To understand deathways, it employs a second new methodology, funerary taphonomy. Combining osteobiography and taphonomy allows us to connect ancient lives and deaths. Peninsular Italy provides a substantial test sequence typical of much of Europe. For each of three key periods (Neolithic, 6000-4000 BC; Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, 4000-1800 BC; Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age, 1800-600 BC), 200+ individuals will be analysed. The results will allow us to evaluate for the first time how inequality affected lives in prehistoric Europe and what role ancestors played in it.",
