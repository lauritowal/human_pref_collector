        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the critical issue of improving access to public services in low-income countries, where an estimated 5.7 million fatalities and the descent of 100 million individuals into extreme poverty are attributed annually to service inaccessibility. Despite the global shift towards digitalization of public services as a solution for broader and more efficient access, low-income countries experience a high project failure rate, with approximately one-third of digital initiatives being abandoned, thereby squandering resources and potentially exacerbating social inequalities.\n\nThe proposed research seeks to deepen our knowledge of the factors influencing the success or failure of public sector digitalization in developing nations and explore how digital technologies can be deployed to enhance the effectiveness and inclusiveness of public service provision. The research will contribute to more equitable economic growth by ensuring that a wider population benefits from improved access to quality public services.\n\nThe methodology involves conducting four large-scale randomized experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia—countries actively undergoing public service digitalization. These experiments will focus on digital technologies that affect the demand side by enabling citizens to digitally access services, and the supply side by facilitating remote monitoring and supervision of service providers.\n\nIn partnership with local governments and NGOs, the research findings aim to guide public policy, fostering digitalization strategies that do not leave vulnerable groups behind. Ultimately, the project aspires to provide empirical evidence that can help low-income countries optimize their digital transformation processes, ensuring that digitalization serves as a tool for inclusion and social betterment rather than a divider."

Governments across the globe have responded by adopting digital technologies — e.g., by making services available to citizens virtually — in the hopes of providing broader, faster, and cheaper access to public services. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in this regard, low-income countries continue to struggle with nearly one-third of digitalization projects being abandoned and substantial resources being wasted (World Development Report, 2016). Moreover, even when successful, these digitization projects they risk excluding vulnerable individuals with limited connectivity, potentially widening existing inequalities. This research proposal aims to advance our understanding of (i) the determinants of the success or failure of digitalization in the public sector of developing countries, and (ii) the ways digital technologies can be harnessed to improve the efficiency and inclusion of public service delivery, thereby producing more robust and inclusive economic growth. In collaboration with local governments and NGOs, I will design and carry out four large-scale randomized experiments in countries where public services are being digitized (India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Liberia). In these experiments, I will study digital technologies that influence (i) the demand for public services by allowing citizens to access them digitally, and (ii) the supply of in-person services by remotely monitoring or supervising the delivery agents. The results will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately helping a broader segment of the population access more and higher quality public services.",
