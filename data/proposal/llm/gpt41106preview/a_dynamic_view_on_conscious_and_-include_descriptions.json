        "Abstract:\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between conscious and unconscious processes is pivotal in unraveling the complexities of the human mind. Traditional research has approached this distinction through static methodologies, limiting our comprehension to a snapshot perspective of mental processes. The proposed research aims to transcend this limitation by investigating the dynamic nature of both conscious and unconscious mental processes through a multi-faceted approach, integrating behavioral and brain imaging techniques.\n\nThe project will unfold across three investigative tracks. The first focuses on unconscious perception, challenging the static quo by examining how our visual system processes dynamic, subliminally received information streams in real life. Utilizing Gaze-Contingent Substitution, this track will introduce subliminal videos and stimuli sequences to probe the dynamics of unconscious processing.\n\nThe second track shifts to conscious perception, exploring how conscious perceptual constructs interact with prior knowledge. We will apply a Bayesian framework to decipher the cognitive mechanisms that integrate prior knowledge, allowing for the \"filling-in\" of perceptual gaps during states of partial awareness.\n\nThe third and final track addresses the maturation of consciousness, targeting the developmental trajectory of conscious versus unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants. Through psychophysical assessments and high-density EEG, this track will investigate whether consciousness emerges from the maturation of posterior sensory regions or anterior regions associated with attention and executive control.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include demonstrating sophisticated subliminal influences, clarifying cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and shedding light on the developmental onset of consciousness. This research promises to significantly advance our understanding of the human mind by unraveling the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious cognition and their evolution throughout human development."

Most research on this topic has been limited to a static perspective, by studying static stimuli, by considering processing as a function of present information, and by focusing on a single, adult stage of development. Yet, both conscious and unconscious mental processes are intrinsically driven by dynamic properties. We will study these properties by relying on behavioral and brain imaging methods along three tracks: 1) Unconscious perception: Our visual system is, in real life, constantly receiving unconscious sequences of information that will generate dynamic and constantly updated processing streams. We will study these dynamic unconscious streams, thanks to Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel approach allowing for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. 2) Conscious perception: Construction of a conscious percept does not only depend on present stimulation but also on interactions with prior knowledge. Relying on the Bayesian framework, we will study the mechanisms by which prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents, by \"filling-in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness. 3) The maturation of consciousness: Using both psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, we will study the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants, and whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information, or rather anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control. The expected impact of the project will be 1) to evidence sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions 3) to provide new insights on the mystery of how consciousness develops in humans.",
