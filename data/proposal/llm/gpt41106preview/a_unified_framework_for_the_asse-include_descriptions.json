        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal presents a comprehensive program designed to address the burgeoning complexity and application challenges in the field of cognitive modeling. Cognitive models are invaluable for explicating the latent psychological processes underlying human reasoning, learning, decision-making, and action. Despite their utility, the field is characterized by a confusing array of models and techniques, leading to inconsistent application and understanding. To streamline this process, we propose the creation of a unified framework grounded in Bayesian inference, spearheaded by a Quantitative Development Team and a Core Application Team. The former will innovate generic methods for assessing model fit, refine algorithms for parameter estimation, and adapt these models to common experimental designs. The Core Application Team will hone in on three impactful model classes – drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models – and will enhance them through the establishment of parameter priors, diagnostic experiments, and hierarchical Bayes factors assessment. Our objective is to elevate the practice of cognitive modeling to a new standard, ensuring both theoretical rigor and practical applicability. The integration of these advancements into JASP, a user-friendly statistical software developed in our lab, will democratize access to cutting-edge cognitive modeling techniques for a broad audience, including students, researchers, and clinicians. This initiative promises to crystallize the state-of-the-art in cognitive modeling and facilitate its widespread and effective use across the domains of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology."

Cognitive models also serve as measurement tools that explain observed behavior in terms of constituent psychological processes. Because of their unique ability to estimate latent processes, cognitive models are increasingly applied throughout cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. Despite their theoretical appeal and growing popularity, however, the field of cognitive modeling presents an often bewildering proliferation of ideas and techniques. Current applications appear idiosyncratic, and the state-of-the-art remains unclear. This lack of systematicity makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to develop, understand, and apply important cognitive models. This proposal outlines a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models. Based on the foundations of Bayesian inference, a Quantitative Development Team develops new generic methods to assess absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, explores efficient algorithms to estimate model parameters, and examines how the models can be applied to data from popular experimental designs. A Core Application Team focuses on three classes of cognitive models of particular impact: the drift decision models, the stop-signal race models, and the reinforcement learning models. These model classes are enriched by the construction of plausible parameter priors, the development of diagnostic experiments, the assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs, and the model-averaged assessment of changes in parameters. The proposed work aims to set a new standard for cognitive modeling. Practical relevance is enhanced by incorporating the techniques in JASP, a user-friendly statistical software package developed in my lab (jasp-stats.org). By adding the new techniques to JASP, the cognitive models and associated new methodology become available for students, researchers, and practitioners.",
