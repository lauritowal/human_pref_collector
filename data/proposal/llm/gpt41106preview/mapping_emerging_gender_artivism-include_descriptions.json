        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the objectives of MEGAMAPS, a pioneering research project that seeks to investigate and document Artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space post-2011 uprisings. The project's innovative interdisciplinary approach combines History, Social Movements Theory, Gender Studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities to examine the phenomena in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. MEGAMAPS aims to enrich global academic knowledge of the Arab region by crafting a unique 'history from below', examining the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social transformation.\n\nCentral to the project is the development of an open-access, participative digital platform that will serve as the first research tool of its kind focusing on Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region. This platform will document, organize, and interlink a living corpus of sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and innovative cartographic and graphic tools, making it widely accessible to scholars, practitioners, and the public. It will challenge traditional approaches to History and Social Movements Theory regarding the Arab world and make the collected data FAIRly accessible.\n\nMEGAMAPS will also engage in dissemination activities, fostering a transnational network of artists, researchers, policymakers, and civil society stakeholders. These activities aim to facilitate the exchange of best practices in the realm of gender equality, arts, and democratic governance. The project intends to counteract the victimization narrative surrounding women and sexual minorities in the Arab region by promoting an agency paradigm. Furthermore, it aspires to dismantle orientalist and Islamophobic attitudes within Western public opinion, offering a new perspective on the region's sociopolitical dynamics through the lens of grassroots artistic movements."

By focusing on 4 countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia) the project aims to innovate the global academic knowledge on the Arab region by the writing of an unprecedented history from below which investigates the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent and social change. Based on fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS aims to frame, explore and map emerging Artivism for gender equality, conceived as a political incubator which revitalizes an egalitarian project of society in the post-2011 authoritarian ebb. In addition to academic publications, the project aims at producing the first open access and participative digital platform which will consistently document, systematize and interconnect a corpus of living sources (visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and cartographies, maps, graphic tools) and will: a) innovate the traditional approaches of History and Social Movements Theory on the Arab region; b) provide the first research platform dealing with Artivism, gender and social change in the Arab region; c) make this corpus FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders and to the general public. MEGAMAPS also involves a set of dissemination activities aimed to improve activistsâ€™ participation in a transnational network of artists, researchers, policy-makers and civil society stakeholders in order to promote mutual exchanges of best practices in the field of gender equality, arts and democratic governance, and to contribute in reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities in the Arab region by proposing an agency paradigm, which can also overcome orientalism and islamophobia within the Western public opinion.",
