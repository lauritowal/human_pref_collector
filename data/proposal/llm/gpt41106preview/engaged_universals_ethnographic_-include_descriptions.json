        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an anthropological research project aimed at examining the implementation and impact of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries. UHC, as defined by the WHO, is a health policy initiative that ensures individuals have access to necessary health services without suffering financial hardship. It is a principle embedded within the Sustainable Development Goals and resonates with notions of justice and state obligation. This study is particularly significant in the African context where historical structural-adjustment policies have weakened state healthcare systems, encouraged privatization, and shifted healthcare costs onto the impoverished populace. The research will investigate how UHC, as a global policy, is interpreted and acted upon by local policy-makers, bureaucrats, and citizens, recognizing that UHC is not a universally applicable model but rather a contested concept shaped by competing interests.\n\nThe project will analyze the dynamics between state and citizenry in relation to UHC, the interplay with formal social protection mechanisms, and the effects on informal social networks that traditionally underpin health support systems. By situating UHC within the unique historical and social fabric of each country, the study aims to reveal how state responsibility and public good are negotiated in practice. Employing ethnographic methods, the research will engage in multi-sited and multi-level fieldwork, capturing the complexities of policy-making, implementation, public reception, and debate.\n\nThis investigation into UHC will not only provide a deeper understanding of health policy in African contexts but also contribute to broader anthropological discourse on global health initiatives and public welfare. The findings are expected to have implications that extend far beyond the African continent, offering insights into the global pursuit of equitable health coverage and the realization of the public good in diverse socio-political landscapes."

Defined by the WHO as ensuring that all people can use the health services they need without financial hardship, UHC is a powerful concept that approaches public health as a matter of justice and obligation and is included in the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC is particularly important in Africa, where structural-adjustment policies undermined state capacity, promoted privatization and pushed the burden of payment onto the poor. Recent global health initiatives have done little to address the neglect of national health-care systems and citizens’ lack of trust in them. In these contexts UHC is interesting because it reinserts questions of state responsibility and the public good into health-care. Historically however, African states have only partially pursued the public good, while in practice UHC is surrounding by conflicting interests. UHC is thus not a universal model but a contested field, making it an intriguing site for anthropological research. With a focus on actors and institutions at global, national and local levels in each country, the project will explore how moves towards UHC engage relations between states and citizens and universal concepts such as the public good; how UHC intersects with formal systems of social protection; and how it influences informal social networks that support health, thus situating UHC in national histories and social practices. Tracking the frictions surrounding UHC at the levels of policy-making, implementation, among beneficiaries, and in public debate, the project will use ethnographic methodology in innovative ways through fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level. The project’s focus on a global policy and the public good opens new research directions and will produce knowledge of relevance beyond Africa.",
