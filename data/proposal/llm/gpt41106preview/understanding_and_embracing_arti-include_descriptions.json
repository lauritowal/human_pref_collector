        "Abstract:\n\nThe project F-AI-MILY aims to investigate the evolving intersection of family dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) through an interdisciplinary approach that combines family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. Recognizing the profound impact that familial relationships have on individual well-being, this research seeks to understand how the integration of AI agents into the household environment influences these critical social dynamics.\n\nThe project comprises three key objectives: the development of a novel group-centered mobile laboratory to analyze family neurocognition; the exploration of developmental changes in family social dynamics due to prolonged AI interactions; and the design of AI support systems for families coping with chronic illness. The first objective involves designing a mobile lab capable of capturing intricate behavioural and neural responses from family members during their interactions with AI. This will provide a detailed understanding of how AI presence affects familial bonds, including the sense of similarity and distance among relatives.\n\nSecondly, the project will assess the long-term effects of AI on children within the family context, focusing on children aged 4 to 12 years. The study will examine how the presence of AI agents can alter developmental trajectories and influence children's flexibility and adaptation to AI.\n\nFinally, the project aims to use the insights gained from the neurocognition-at-home approach to create AI systems that foster healthier social dynamics in families dealing with chronic illness. By providing adaptive support, these AI agents could help shift maladaptive interactions to more constructive patterns, thereby enhancing the overall family environment.\n\nF-AI-MILY's pioneering approach stands to offer significant contributions to our understanding of family systems, the neurocognition of social behavior, and the development of AI agents that are attuned to and supportive of human social needs."

With families increasingly inviting artificial agents into their life, questions arise how we can describe these dynamics in the age of artificial intelligence. Integrating insights and methods from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-ai interaction, F-AI-MILY will 1) establish a new group-centred mobile-lab approach to study the neurocognition of family social dynamics, 2) describe the developmental aspects of changes in households’ social dynamic during long-term interactions with artificial agents, and 3) identify how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can provide support in households with chronic illness. First, we will develop a new group-centred mobile lab to study how the key mechanisms of social dynamics, similarity and distance between family members, are impacted by interactions with artificial agents. Using this innovative neurocognition-at-home approach we will measure both behavioural and brain measures of key attitudes and behaviours of all family members and uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity. Second, we will test how child development interacts with the impact of artificial agents on social dynamics. Going beyond one-off interactions, we will directly test how long-term living with an artificial agent affects families with children (4-12 years) that differ in their flexibility to the influence of these agent. Third, we will use the neurocognition-at-home approach to guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households. This artificial agent support system targets family coping with chronic illness and aims to change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics. The innovative, interdisciplinary, and full circle approach of F-AI-MILY offers new ground-breaking vistas on family systems, neurocognition of social behaviour, and the developmental of artificial agents.",
