        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the significance of heterogeneity in economic agents on macroeconomic fluctuations and the resulting implications for optimal monetary policy design. The research will pivot around the innovative Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) framework, which incorporates diverse household behaviors into economic modeling. The primary objective is to establish an \"organizing framework\" that recognizes two categories of economic agents – \"unconstrained,\" who adhere to intertemporal optimality, and \"constrained,\" who do not. By introducing a heterogeneity wedge, this study aims to quantify the discrepancy in aggregate consumption or investment behaviors, compared to models assuming a uniform agent. This analysis will elucidate the mechanisms of heterogeneity within HANK models and actual economies, guided by empirical data.\n\nThe secondary objective involves a comparative assessment of HANK models against Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) models, which simplify the heterogeneity to just two agent types. This comparison will address whether TANK models can effectively approximate the complex dynamics of HANK models and offer superior empirical congruence over classic Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models. The research will undertake several applications of these models to investigate the influence of constrained households on the benefits of wage flexibility, the economic impact of monetary injections, and the effect of agent diversity on optimal monetary policy formulation.\n\nBy dissecting the multi-faceted role of agent heterogeneity, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of economic fluctuations and inform the development of robust monetary policies that consider the full spectrum of household behaviors."

A first objective is the development of an “organizing framework” which focuses on the distinction between two types of agents of households (or firms) at any point in time: those who satisfy an intertemporal optimality condition (labeled as “unconstrained”) and those who do not (labeled as “constrained”). A heterogeneity wedge can be defined that accounts for the differential behavior of aggregate consumption (or investment) relative to an economy with a representative household (or firm). The analysis of that wedge and its components should help understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates, both in the context of specific HANK models as well as actual economies (using household or firm-level panel data). A second objective is the conduct of a comparative analysis of the aggregate equilibrium dynamics of HANK and TANK (for Two Agent New Keynesian) models. The latter class of models, which preserve the tractability and ease of interpretation of the standard Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) model, restrict the heterogeneity to the presence of two types of agents (constrained and unconstrained), with a constant share of each in the population. The key question to be studied is the extent to which some version of a TANK model may provide a good approximation to the dynamics of existing HANK models, as well as a better data fit than their RANK counterparts. Several applications are proposed, including the analysis of the role of constrained households in shaping the gains from wage flexibility and in determining the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, as well as the study of the impact of heterogeneity on the nature of the optimal monetary policy.",
