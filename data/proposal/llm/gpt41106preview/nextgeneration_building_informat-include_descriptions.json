        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research seeks to address a critical gap in the current practice of architectural design and building modeling. Despite the widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems, existing tools fall short in capturing the essence of how buildings interact with their users and environments. Presently, models are limited to describing the physical and material aspects of structures, neglecting the vital contextual, functional, and social dimensions that determine the success of a building in meeting the needs of its occupants.\n\nThis project aims to develop a novel, comprehensive building modeling method that integrates form, function, and usage information. The goal is to transcend traditional evaluations that focus solely on physical characteristics such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, and to enable architects and designers to predict and evaluate the impact of unconstructed buildings on the lives and activities of future users. We recognize that buildings are not standalone entities but are deeply intertwined with the social, cultural, and economic fabric of their users' lives.\n\nThe challenge of predicting user behavior in built environments and their interactions with the building and with others is undoubtedly complex. However, there is a wealth of research that analyzes human behavior in such environments, which has not yet been systematically incorporated into architectural design practices. Our research will bridge this gap by leveraging existing knowledge to enhance building models, thus leading to better-designed buildings that are responsive to user needs.\n\nIn light of the undeniable influence of the built environment on sustainability, quality of life, and even the viability of life on Earth, it is imperative to enhance the tools available to building designers. This research represents a critical step in that direction, with the potential to revolutionize the design process and result in buildings that are more harmonious with their users and the environment."

Buildings, unlike other products, cannot be understood independently of their context, of their intended use, and of their intended users. This shortcoming hinders the ability of current building models to support evaluations other than those based on physical and material characteristics of the building, such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability. In particular, the impact of a building that has not yet been built on the life and activities of its future users—a key element in determining whether or not the proposed building will meet the needs of its intended users—is not afforded by current building models. To afford comprehensive prediction and evaluation of future buildings, we also need to model the purpose and function of the building, and the social, cultural, and economic profile of the people who will use it. Although predicting users' behavior in a built environment and their interaction with the building and with other people is a highly complex task, vast research exists that is devoted to analyzing and explaining human behavior in built environments. Still, due to the shortcomings of building models, this knowledge rarely make into the practice of architectural design, at the time buildings are being designed. The proposed research aims at remedying that shortcoming by developing a more a comprehensive building modeling method, which will include form, function, and use information. A better model will lead to better designed buildings. In an era when the irrevocable impact of the built environment on the cost, quality, and perhaps even possibility of life on earth has been recognized, the need to make every effort to improve the tools used by building designers is self-evident.",
