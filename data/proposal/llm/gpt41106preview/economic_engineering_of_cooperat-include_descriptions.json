        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a research project aimed at enhancing cooperation within modern economic and societal systems through innovative market design, informed by advances in computer technology and an economic engineering approach. The project is divided into three work packages, each targeting a specific cooperation challenge with the application of experimental methods and behavioral game theory.\n\nThe first package focuses on the design of electronic reputation mechanisms to foster trust and cooperation in online interactions. Despite the recognition of current systems' inadequacies, there is a lack of empirical research and normative frameworks for improving and creating effective digital trust systems. The second work package addresses the need to circumvent detrimental arms races for speed in real-time financial and electricity markets. Algorithmic sniping strategies, although collectively wasteful and destabilizing, currently persist due to a lack of understanding concerning the resilience of alternative market designs that can prevent such practices.\n\nThe third package explores the alignment of modern market transactions with ethical considerations, investigating societal discomfort with transactions such as reciprocal kidney exchange and the trade of pollution rights. The project seeks to unravel the nature and resilience of the aversion to these types of market activities.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of practical guidance for the construction of better reputation systems, the identification of market designs immune to speed races, and insights into the ethical dimensions of market transactions. The project promises to enhance market functionality while contributing to the broader disciplines of cooperation science and behavioral economic engineering, with significant implications for both theoretical advancement and real-world application."

Thus, with inappropriate mechanisms to harness self-interest by aligning it with the common good, the outcome of social and economic interaction can be bleak and even catastrophic. Recent advances in computer technology lead to radical innovation in market design and trading strategies. This creates both, new challenges and exciting opportunities for “engineering cooperation”. This project uses the economic engineering approach (as advocated by Alvin Roth) to address some of the most pressing cooperation problems of modern markets and societies. I propose three work packages, each using innovative experimental methods and (behavioral) game theory in order to address a specific challenge: The first one studies the design of electronic reputation mechanisms that promote cooperation in the digital world. Previous research has shown that mechanisms to promote trust on the Internet are flawed. Yet, there is little empirical and normative guidance on how to repair these systems, and engineer better ones. The second studies the design of mechanisms that avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial and electricity market trading. Traders use algorithmic sniping strategies, even when they are collectively wasteful and seriously threatening market liquidity and stability. Yet, little is known about the robust properties of alternative market designs to eliminate sniping. The third one studies how to design modern markets that align with ethical considerations. People sometimes have a distaste for certain kinds of modern transactions, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights. Yet, little is known about the underlying nature and robustness of this distaste. My project will generate important knowledge to improve the functioning of modern markets, and at the same time open new horizons in the sciences of cooperation and of “behavioral economic engineering”.",
