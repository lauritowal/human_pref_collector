        "**Abstract:**\n\nAmidst contemporary economic challenges and environmental crises, foraging has emerged as an increasingly vital source of livelihood across the globe. This project seeks to offer a comprehensive examination of foraging practices as a critical economic activity and a complex form of interaction between societies and their environments, particularly in the current epoch known as the Anthropocene. Despite its growing prevalence—from Tibet and Nepal's yartsagunbu gatherers to the Siberian tuskers hunting for mammoth ivory, and from the artisanal miners of Amazonia to the \"Amazon nomads\" of the US—this phenomenon has yet to receive the scholarly attention it warrants within conservation and development discussions.\n\nThe project aims to bridge this gap through the development of a political ecology of foraging, addressing both its socio-economic dimensions and environmental implications. The urgency of this research is underscored by the increasing relevance of foraging as a survival strategy in the wake of the 2008-2011 global financial crisis and as traditional middle-class aspirations and welfare states become less attainable. Concurrently, foraging practices intersect with the critical need for environmental conservation, given the accelerating climate crisis and biodiversity loss.\n\nThis interdisciplinary investigation, based at the Rachel Carson Center at LMU Munich, will be conducted by a distinguished international team of five researchers. The team will produce a robust body of work, including two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, and twelve peer-reviewed articles. Additionally, the project will disseminate its findings to a broader audience through the production of a documentary film and the organization of an exhibition. By combining anthropological rigor with a broad interdisciplinary approach, this project will provide invaluable insights into the role of foraging in the Anthropocene, with implications reaching far beyond academia."

In Tibet and Nepal, scores of collectors rush to the mountains each spring to collect yartsagunbu – a rare mushroom more valuable than gold. In Siberia, “tuskers” scavenge for woolly mammoth ivory in the thawing permafrost. From Amazonia to Mongolia, artisanal miners extract precious minerals where transnational conglomerates have left. In the US, “Amazon nomads” tour foreclosed shops and sell their bounty online. Broadly understood as practices of collecting, scavenging and gleaning, foraging is a global phenomenon of our times. However, it only gains patchy attention in mainstream debates on conservation and development. What is missing is a conceptual understanding of foraging as a basic economic strategy and a form of socio-environmental entanglement. The objective of this project is to take on this task and develop a political ecology of foraging in the Anthropocene. The project is timely. In the aftermath of the world financial crisis between 2008 to 2011, foraging has gained in relevance around the globe. In an era when the dream of a middle-class life based on a stable, salaried job no longer seems viable, and in places where the welfare state is under pressure, has never existed or has vanished, foraging is often the only avenue to upward social mobility. At the same time, the climate crisis and concerns for the rapid loss of biodiversity are raising the urgency for environmental conservation. To understand the evolving frictions at this interface is highly relevant at this historical moment – both in academia and beyond. Interdisciplinary in outlook but grounded in anthropology, the project will be carried out by an international team of five researchers at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich. Outputs include 2 monograph, 3 edited collections, 3 PhD thesis, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film and an exhibition.",
