        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Silence in Sovereignty: Understanding State Inaction in International Law\"**\n\nInternational law traditionally evolves from the active conduct of States, but the implications of State inaction remain critically under-explored. This project proposes a pioneering comprehensive analysis of the role and legal consequences of State silence within the realm of international law. It interrogates pressing questions: Can silence constitute consent or indicate acquiescence, thereby binding States to certain obligations? How does silence impact the responsibility of States, and what are the ramifications for international dispute resolution when States choose not to participate?\n\nThe significance of this study extends to States, international and domestic courts, and individuals keen to understand the enforceability of international obligations when a State chooses passivity over action. Despite its importance, scholarship lacks a thorough understanding of State silence, leaving major gaps in both theory and practice. This project endeavors to fill this void by (a) developing a detailed taxonomy of State 'silences' and (b) examining the legal effects of various forms of silence. Furthermore, it will assess whether these insights necessitate a reevaluation of current legal frameworks.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will scrutinize State practices across diverse jurisdictions, employing the six official languages of the United Nations for inclusive research. It will also analyze international jurisprudence and literature, alongside empirical evaluations of reasoning by government officials and international judges. This dual approach will illuminate the advantages and disadvantages of State silence, particularly in non-appearance at international courts and tribunals.\n\nThrough its novel and rigorous methodology, this project aspires to make a substantial contribution to international legal scholarship and practice, potentially prompting a paradigm shift in how State silence is perceived and treated in the international legal system."

It is identified by observing the behaviour of States and deriving rules from their behaviour. But, what happens when States do nothing? Can States be bound by their own silence? Can international law develop through the silence of States? Can States be responsible for doing nothing? What happens when States do not appear before international courts and tribunals? These questions are immensely significant for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, who are all interested in knowing what the obligations of States are and how they can be enforced within and outside international courts and tribunals. Yet, there are major gaps in our understanding of the meaning of State silence and its legal effects. This project is the first comprehensive study of the silence of States in international law. It will explore and analyze whether the silence of States can bind them, and if so, under which circumstances; the role of State inaction for the responsibility of States; and the effect of State inaction in the field of international dispute settlement, focusing particularly on the proceedings before international courts and tribunals. It aims (a) to make a major contribution to knowledge on the meaning of silence by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the ‘silences’ of States and on the legal effects of different ‘silences’; and (b) to critically analyse whether a change in the law may be called for. The project will conduct research in wide-ranging and geographically representative State practice available in the six official languages of the United Nations, international jurisprudence and literature. It will also employ empirical analysis of the reasoning of government officials’ and international judges in order to assess the advantages and disadvantages of States silence, in the form of non-appearance, in international judicial procedures.",
