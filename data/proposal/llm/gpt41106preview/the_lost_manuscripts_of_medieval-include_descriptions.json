        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the objectives and methodologies of LostMa, a pioneering research project designed to analyze the evolution of written cultural artefacts and their transmission processes. The study seeks to determine the extent to which the preservation or loss of written texts and ideas can be attributed to factors beyond mere chance. By drawing parallels with biological evolution and the variance of language, LostMa aims to delve into the mechanisms by which manuscript texts are copied, altered, or obliterated and to explore the role of human agency in these processes.\n\nThe project proposes a novel approach by synthesizing artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to examine the movement of texts within cultural contexts. Specifically, it will employ stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations to mimic the transmission of textual materials. A focused case study will analyze chivalric literature across European traditions, employing a corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, and a close examination of approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts.\n\nAdvanced deep learning techniques will facilitate extensive data collection, enabling the comparison of empirical observations with simulation outcomes. This comparison will allow the project to quantify deviations from random chance, infer non-observable metrics like the loss/survival rates of literary works, and shed light on the dynamics governing the perpetuation of cultural heritage.\n\nLostMa's innovative investigation stands to revolutionize our understanding of cultural transmission and the factors influencing the longevity of written artefacts. By revealing the interplay between chance and human influence in the survival of cultural texts, the project will offer invaluable insights into the formation of cultural canons and the preservation of our collective cultural memory."

It strives to establish in what measure the transmission (and subsequent preservation or loss) of written artefacts, texts and ideas deviates from pure chance, and, if it deviates, by how much and why it does. It will do so by analysing the way that texts in manuscript form were copied, transformed or destroyed, in a similar way to the evolution of living organisms or of language variants, through process of innovation/mutation, fixation or extinction. As such, the goal of this project is not only to understand the processes behind the transmission of texts, but also to grasp the extent to which humans are the actors of the transmission of their own culture and how much the survival of texts or the constitution of cultural canons are due to chance. If this notion may seem provocative to humanities researchers, evolutionary biologists have long discovered the role of random drift in the survival or extinction of genetic traits and species. To investigate this question, this project will attempt a paradigm-shift in philological methods, by combining artificial intelligence, complexity science and philological expertise. Stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations will be used to emulate the process of textual transmission. A case study will be taken, regarding chivalric literature in European context. Supported by deep learning methods, large-scale data collection will be made on a corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic and Celtic languages, with a full-text zoom on approx. 1000 Old French manuscripts. Data will provide observable values to be compared to simulation results, in order to measure deviations from chance, make inferences on non observable values such as loss/survival rates of works and manuscripts, and understand the dynamics at work behind the transmission of texts.",
