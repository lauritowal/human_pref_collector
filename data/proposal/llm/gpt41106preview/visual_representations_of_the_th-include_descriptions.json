        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious project aimed at examining the impact of photography on public understanding and cross-cultural discourse during the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). The study posits that the burgeoning technology of photography was instrumental in garnering wider acceptance of bacteriological explanations for disease, thereby shaping modern perceptions of infectious illness, hygiene, and the necessity of international health cooperation. The focal point of the research is the extensive collection and analysis of visual documentation from the pandemic that claimed approximately 12 million lives worldwide.\n\nThe project's groundbreaking approach involves a comprehensive historical and anthropological examination of the visual narrative that accompanied the spread of the plague, highlighting its influence on geopolitical, colonial, and biopolitical dynamics at the dawn of the 20th century. This analysis will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of public health awareness and the societal envisioning of a globally connected, hygienic modernity.\n\nA team of researchers led by the Principal Investigator will systematically explore the visual representations of the plague, focusing on four key geographical regions: China and Japan; India; Africa; and South and North America. Each region will be the responsibility of a dedicated postdoctoral researcher, working in full-time collaboration under the project's umbrella. The collective endeavor will assess the entwined histories of plague imagery, with an interdisciplinary methodology that scrutinizes four salient themes: the built environment, civil unrest and public order, mortality and funerary practices, and the intersections of race, class, and discrimination.\n\nThis study is poised to offer a novel perspective on the role of visual media in the historical framing of public health crises, providing critical insights into how collective memory and cultural attitudes are shaped in the face of widespread contagion. The project's outcomes will be invaluable for scholars and policymakers alike, informing contemporary dialogues on global health and disease management."

The project will collect and analyse for the first time all visual documents of the third plague pandemic, which broke out in 1855 in Southwest China and raged across the globe until 1959, causing the death of approximately 12 million people. The projectâ€™s aim is to engage in a historical and anthropological analysis of this global network of visual representations, underlining how it played a crucial role in the negotiation of geopolitical, colonial and biopolitical relations at the turn of the 20th century, with great bearing on public health consciousness and the social imagination of a new era of globalised hygienic modernity. Research will focus on four regions: China and Japan; India; Africa; South and North America, the first investigated by the Principal Investigator, while the rest being allocated to 3 postdoctoral researchers, all employed full-time in the project. While investigating the visual record of plague in their respective regions, researchers will engage in a collaborative and interdisciplinary analysis of the entangled history of the visual representation of the third pandemic, taking as a common analytical ground 4 different but vitally interlinked aspects of the visual representation of the pandemic: a) the built environment; b) civil disturbance and public order; c) death, corpses and burial; d) race, class and discrimination.",
