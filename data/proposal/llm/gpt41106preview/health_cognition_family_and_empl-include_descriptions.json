        "Abstract:\n\nThe current landscape of men's health and cognition is confronted with significant challenges due to the changing dynamics of family structures and labor market participation. With men experiencing higher rates of premature mortality, much of which is preventable, there is a pressing need to understand the underlying factors contributing to these health disparities. The proposed project, HOMME, aims to investigate how the evolving roles of men within their family and working lives impact their health and cognitive function.\n\nAs societal norms shift, men are increasingly falling behind in tertiary education, facing higher job loss due to technological advancements, and experiencing greater rates of childlessness. Simultaneously, there is a rise in paternal childcare involvement and a decline in the conventional male breadwinner paradigm. These changes warrant a comprehensive examination to ascertain their effects on men's health outcomes across different life stages.\n\nLeveraging extensive Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data, HOMME will conduct an in-depth analysis of the correlations between men's family and work experiences and their health and cognition. The study will span young adulthood to midlife, critical periods marked by significant family and work transitions. By exploring cohort and period variations, the work-family interface, the impact of the male breadwinner model, and paternal childcare participation, the project aims to unravel the complexities of selection and causality in these relationships.\n\nWith a sample size exceeding 12,000 men from late adolescence to the ages of 36 to 69, HOMME will integrate genetic information, parental and partner histories, self-reported and clinical health records, employment data, and cognitive functioning trajectories. This extensive data collection will allow for a robust assessment of the factors influencing men's health and cognition. The project's findings will not only contribute to the scientific understanding of gender differences in health outcomes but also inform targeted interventions to enhance men's well-being and societal contributions. The successful funding of this project will enable continued research beyond the initial age range, further enriching the study's longitudinal scope and impact."

Improving men’s health and cognition is not only critical for achieving gender equality, but also for enhancing and extending men’s potential to contribute to their families, the labour market and society as populations grow older. HOMME studies how men’s (changing) family and working lives influence their health and cognition. Men’s family and working lives are changing: Men now lag behind women with regards to tertiary education; female labour participation has increased while male labour participation has slightly decreased. Men are more apt to lose their job due to technological change. Male childlessness has risen dramatically, much more than female childlessness; in many Western countries, one out of four or almost one out of three men are now childless at age 40. Fathers are participating more in childcare, and men have partially lost their role as family “breadwinners”. So far, insufficient research has examined the consequences of these changes on men’s health and cognition. HOMME capitalizes on the richness of Norwegian population register, survey, and genetic data to examine how men’s (rapidly changing) family and working lives are related to their health and cognition across adulthood, as well as across cohorts, periods and between communities. We focus on young adulthood and midlife – the life period most characterized by family transitions and work experiences. We examine cohort and period differences, men’s work-face interface, the male breadwinner model and fathers’ participation in childcare, and disentangle selection and causality. Our data covers genes; parents, (former) spouses and partners; self-reported, clinical, and register measures of health; register data on work participation and occupation; and cognitive trajectories of N=12,000+ men between the late teens to ages 36 to 69 (and potentially beyond, pending funding of the project).",
