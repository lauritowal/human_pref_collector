    "descriptions": [
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MORAPOL project represents a pioneering investigation into the evolution of morality policies within the OECD countries over a significant thirty-year span from 1980 to 2010. Positioned at the frontier of policy analysis, MORAPOL's dual objectives encompass groundbreaking empirical exploration and conceptual innovation. With a novel empirical lens, this research is the first of its kind to systematically unpack the progression of morality policies, a domain that remains largely uncharted from a policy-analytical standpoint. The project meticulously compares the dynamics of morality policy across 25 OECD nations, focusing on three distinct subfields: \"life and death\" issues such as abortion and euthanasia; matters of sexuality, including prostitution, pornography, and homosexuality; and regulations surrounding addictive substances and behaviors.\n\nConceptually, MORAPOL strives to formulate overarching theoretical frameworks that elucidate the patterns of change across entire policy fields rather than isolated policies or items. This holistic methodology challenges conventional approaches, paving the way for comprehensive theories that can accurately reflect transformations within whole sectors or their subdivisions. To achieve this, MORAPOL employs a mixed-methods strategy, initially conducting a macro-quantitative analysis predicated on legislative data pertaining to the specified subfields and countries. Subsequently, this quantitative assessment informs the selection of qualitative case studies, pinpointing the \"critical\" instances where the preliminary theoretical model encounters anomalies. These case studies serve as a robust means to refine and validate the model, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the factors—both international and domestic—that drive changes in morality policy. The insights gleaned from MORAPOL have the potential to vastly enhance our comprehension of policy evolution in morally charged domains."

First, MORAPOL takes an innovative empirical focus. It is the first to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies. This policy area is so far unexplored from a policy-analytical perspective. The focus is on changing patterns of morality policy over time, across countries and policy subfields. The project compares morality policies in 25 OECD countries over a period of thirty years (1980 \u0013 2010). It involves a comparison across different subfields of morality policy, including (1) policies on \"life and death\" (abortion, euthanasia), (2) sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality) and (3) addictive substances and addictive behaviour. Second, the project is conceptually innovative. The theoretical aim is to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields rather than for individual policies or policy items. This holistic approach constitutes a path-breaking departure from existing concepts. This way, it is for the first time possible to develop theories that account for changes in whole policy fields or subfields. To systematically assess the influence of international and domestic factors on morality policy change, MORAPOL adopts a mixed-methods approach. In a first step, a macro-quantitative analysis is undertaken, based on legislative output data for the subfields and countries under study. This analysis is in a second step complemented with qualitative case studies. The case studies are selected on the basis of the results of the quantitative study, which turn out to be “critical” cases; i.e. cases that are apparently incorrectly predicted by the theoretical model.",
