    "title": "MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE",
    "abstract": "MEGAMAPS aims to produce a transnational in-depth study on Artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space after the 2011 uprisings, by using an interdisciplinary novel methodology, where History and Social Movements Theory intersect Gender studies, Visual Arts and Digital Humanities. By focusing on 4 countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia) the project aims to innovate the global academic knowledge on the Arab region by the writing of an unprecedented history from below which investigates the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent and social change. Based on fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS aims to frame, explore and map emerging Artivism for gender equality, conceived as a political incubator which revitalizes an egalitarian project of society in the post-2011 authoritarian ebb. In addition to academic publications, the project aims at producing the first open access and participative digital platform which will consistently document, systematize and interconnect a corpus of living sources (visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and cartographies, maps, graphic tools) and will: a) innovate the traditional approaches of History and Social Movements Theory on the Arab region; b) provide the first research platform dealing with Artivism, gender and social change in the Arab region; c) make this corpus FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders and to the general public. MEGAMAPS also involves a set of dissemination activities aimed to improve activistsâ€™ participation in a transnational network of artists, researchers, policy-makers and civil society stakeholders in order to promote mutual exchanges of best practices in the field of gender equality, arts and democratic governance, and to contribute in reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities in the Arab region by proposing an agency paradigm, which can also overcome orientalism and islamophobia within the Western public opinion.",
