    "title": "Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949",
    "abstract": "This project investigates the cross-fertilisation of Anglo/American and German literature and film during the Allied Occupation of Germany. It will be the first study to survey the cultural landscape of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany in any detail. By doing so it will offer a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, in particular in three areas: the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany; the history of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature (arguing the two were more intertwined than has previously been suggested); and the history of the relationship between postwar and Cold War. Combining Anglo-American and German literature and film history with critical analysis, cultural history and life-writing, this is a necessarily ambitious, multidisciplinary study which will open up a major new field of research.",
