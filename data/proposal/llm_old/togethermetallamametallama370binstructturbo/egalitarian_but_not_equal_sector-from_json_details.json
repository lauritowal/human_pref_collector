        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials (WAGE Project)\n\nThe WAGE project aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining, a crucial yet understudied aspect of the persistent gender pay gap (GPG). Globally, women earn 20% less than men, with the European average standing at 13% (United Nations, 2022; Eurostat, 2022). This project focuses on Germany, Norway, and Sweden, examining the metal sector and nursing sector to uncover the daily practices and social norms that contribute to sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nThrough ethnographic research, the WAGE project will achieve three primary objectives. First, it will synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. Second, it will analyze daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. Third, it will document and explain how actors in these sectors relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy exploring the intricacies of collective bargaining and its gendered implications, the WAGE project will provide novel insights into the persistence of the GPG. Our findings will inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to more equitable wage formation and a reduction in the GPG. The project's interdisciplinary approach, combining sociology, economics, and gender studies, will foster a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics underlying the GPG, paving the way for a more egalitarian society.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\n\nThe WAGE project aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining and its role in perpetuating gendered wage differentials. Despite progress towards gender equality, a significant global average gender pay gap of 20% persists, with European countries averaging a 13% gap. This project will investigate the mechanisms underlying these disparities through an in-depth examination of collective bargaining practices in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Focusing on the metal and nursing sectors, which are respectively male- and female-dominated, the project will employ ethnographic research methods to uncover the daily practices and interactions that shape wage formation and contribute to gendered wage differentials. The research objectives include comparing collective bargaining histories, analyzing wage increase negotiations, and documenting how actors in each sector relate to wage norms and gendered wage differentials. By shedding light on the complex, sector-specific dynamics driving gendered wage gaps, this project seeks to inform evidence-based policy solutions to promote greater gender equality in the workplace.",

This project seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms perpetuating this disparity.\n\nThrough ethnographic research, the WAGE project will investigate collective bargaining practices in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. The research objectives are threefold: (1) to synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap in the three selected countries, (2) to analyze daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the two sectors, and (3) to document how actors in these sectors relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy exploring the social and cultural dynamics of collective bargaining, the WAGE project will provide new insights into the gendered nature of wage formation and contribute to a deeper understanding of the persistence of gendered wage differentials. The project's findings will inform policy and practice, ultimately helping to reduce the gender pay gap and promote greater economic equality."
