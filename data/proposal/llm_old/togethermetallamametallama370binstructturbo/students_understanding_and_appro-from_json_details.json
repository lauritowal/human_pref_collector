        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Students' Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education (STUDACT)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe STUDACT project aims to investigate students' understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship Education (GCE) in diverse educational settings. In alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4.7, which targets the promotion of GCE by 2030, this project seeks to empower learners and foster mutual understanding between indigenous and migrant populations. Despite the growing emphasis on GCE, there is a lack of systematic research on students' perspectives and appropriation of GCE. This project addresses this knowledge gap by exploring how students of different backgrounds understand and engage with GCE, and how their understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, and education systems.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, including group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis, in six countries (Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK), this project will provide a nuanced understanding of students' agency in shaping their own GCE experiences. The study will also analyze policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance to identify inconsistencies and areas for improvement. By treating students as core partners and agentic participants, this project will provide valuable insights into the ways in which personal traits, context, and education systems influence students' engagement with GCE. The findings of this study will inform the development of more effective GCE strategies, ultimately contributing to the transformation of education systems and the promotion of peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: STUDACT: Students' Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education\n\nThe STUDACT project aims to investigate how students of different backgrounds understand and appropriate Global Citizenship Education (GCE), a critical component of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4.7, targeting 2030. Despite the expectation that students will engage with GCE in their daily lives, there is a lack of systematic research on their understanding and appropriation of GCE. This project addresses this knowledge gap by exploring how students' personal traits, contexts, and education systems influence their engagement with GCE.\n\nThe study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis in six countries: Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK. The analysis will focus on policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance. The research questions guiding this study include: How do students understand GCE? How do they appropriate it? How do understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems? And, how are student attitudes aligned with those inferred by international organizations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, or teachers?\n\nBy treating students as core partners and agentic participants, STUDACT seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of student reception, understanding, and appropriation of GCE. The project's findings will inform the transformation of education systems, empower learners, and foster mutual understanding between indigenous and migrant populations, ultimately contributing to the building of peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: STUDACT: Students' Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education\n\nThe STUDACT project aims to explore and contextualize students' reception, understanding, and appropriation of Global Citizenship Education (GCE), recognizing them as core partners and agentic participants. In alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.7, which targets the promotion of GCE by 2030, this study seeks to address the current lack of systematic research on student understanding and appropriation of GCE. Our hypothesis is that students engage with GCE based on their personal traits or context.\n\nThe project will employ a mixed-methods approach, including group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis, in six countries: Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK. We will collect data from students of diverse backgrounds to investigate how they understand and appropriate GCE, and how their understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems. Our research questions focus on student understanding and appropriation of GCE, as well as the alignment of their attitudes with those inferred by international organizations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, and teachers.\n\nThe STUDACT project will provide valuable insights into the complexities of GCE, informing education systems, policymakers, and practitioners on how to empower learners and foster mutual understanding between indigenous and migrant populations. By exploring the nuances of student understanding and appropriation of GCE, we can work towards transforming education systems, building peaceful and inclusive societies, and promoting global citizenship."
