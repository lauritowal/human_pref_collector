        "Here is a 257-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management\n\nThe LostInZoom project addresses a critical gap in the design of multi-scale interactive maps, which are increasingly used in professional and daily contexts, including crisis management. Current map design guidelines are inadequate for these interactive maps, leading to users feeling disoriented and lost after zooming interactions. This project aims to establish new zooming paradigms based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during zooming, ensuring a smooth exploratory experience for map users.\n\nThe objectives of this project are threefold: (1) identify multi-scale visual landmarks that serve as anchors for map readers during zooming, (2) design new cartographic generalisation techniques for multi-scale maps, and (3) create new zooming interactions focused on identified landmarks. To achieve these objectives, we will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining experimentation to explore cognition of multi-scale interactive maps, design of cartographic generalisation techniques, and design of zooming interactions. The outcome of this project will be a set of guidelines and tools for map designers to create effective and user-friendly multi-scale interactive maps, with a specific focus on crisis management applications. By improving the usability of these maps, we can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of crisis response efforts.",

Current guidelines for map design do not apply to these interactive maps, leading to a lack of smooth exploratory experiences. This project aims to establish new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during zooming.

Our use case is crisis management, where effective navigation and understanding of multi-scale maps are crucial for timely and informed decision-making.\n\nBy investigating the anchor theory in cartographic zoom interactions, we expect to provide new insights into how users interact with multi-scale maps and develop design guidelines for creating seamless zooming experiences. The outcomes of this project will have significant implications for a wide range of applications, from emergency response to urban planning and navigation. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the usability and effectiveness of multi-scale interactive maps, leading to better decision-making and crisis management outcomes.",
        "Here is a 257-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management\n\nThe LostInZoom project addresses a critical need in cartography: designing intuitive and effective zooming interactions for multi-scale maps. Current guidelines for map design do not account for the complexities of interactive maps, leading to user disorientation and confusion. In high-stakes contexts like crisis management, this can have serious consequences. Our project aims to establish new zooming paradigms based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during zooming, enabling users to maintain their spatial awareness and navigate efficiently.\n\nOur objectives are to identify these anchor landmarks, design novel cartographic generalization techniques, and create innovative zooming interactions centered on these landmarks. Through a combination of experimental research, design, and prototyping, we will explore the cognitive processes underlying map use and develop evidence-based guidelines for map designers. Our proposed approach has the potential to transform the way we interact with multi-scale maps, improving the effectiveness of crisis management and other applications. By addressing the long-standing problem of user disorientation in interactive maps, LostInZoom can have a significant impact on the field of cartography and beyond."
