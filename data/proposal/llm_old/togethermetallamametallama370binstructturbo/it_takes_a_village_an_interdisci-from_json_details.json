        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal based on the provided details:\n\nTitle: It Takes a Village: An Interdisciplinary Community Neuroscience Approach to Characterize Multigenerational Interactions\n\nThe InterCom project proposes a novel, interdisciplinary approach to understanding multigenerational communication within and beyond family contexts. By combining laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal and interpersonal measures, we aim to elucidate the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying communication across different age groups. Our research questions focus on the impact of age-related differences in brain rhythms on conversational flow, speech processing, and prediction abilities. To address these questions, we will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events, co-designed with community partners. We will then use these data to inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies, and vice versa. Our objectives include combining laboratory and real-world data collection, and developing stimuli and analyzing data in a reciprocal manner between lab and real-world settings. By achieving our goals of understanding multigenerational communication and generating insights and tools to improve communication between and across generations, we will contribute to the development of a novel \"community neuroscience\" approach that leverages the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control.",
        "Here is a 264-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: It takes a village: An interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions\n\nThe InterCom project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of multigenerational communication by integrating laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal and interpersonal measures. Our research aims to address critical questions about how individuals of different ages interact and communicate, including how age-related differences in brain rhythms impact conversational flow, how listeners process speech from children or older adults, and whether intergenerational miscommunications can be attributed to differences in predictive abilities. \n\nTo achieve this, we will employ a novel \"community neuroscience\" approach, combining brain, body, and language data collection from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events co-designed with community partners. We will leverage the strengths of both naturalistic observations and experimental control, using data from real-world events to inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies, and vice versa. Our objectives include combining laboratory and real-world data collection, developing stimuli, and analyzing data in a reciprocal manner between lab and real-world settings. Ultimately, InterCom aims to generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations, fostering a deeper understanding of multigenerational interactions and their significance for social connection and community building.",
