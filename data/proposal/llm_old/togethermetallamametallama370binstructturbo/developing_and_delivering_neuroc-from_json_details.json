        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind\n\nThis project proposes to develop and deliver neurocomputational models that bridge the gap between brain and mind, aiming to understand the nature of mental processes, their neural underpinnings, and the basis of neurological patients' impairments. The project converges methods from experimental psychology, behavioural neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies to investigate complex mental behaviours, map neural systems, and develop novel tools to bridge brain and mental behaviour. \n\nThe main activities of the project involve the development of a new type of neurocomputational model that integrates systems-level neuroanatomy and function with detailed cognitive behaviour. The project's goals are to secure systematic methods and tools for bridging cognitive science and systems neuroscience, plan and execute neuroscience and cognitive methods simultaneously, force a convergence of results, and provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. \n\nThe neurocomputational models will be utilized to mimic normal and impaired behaviour, connecting neuroanatomy and cognition. The project's outcome will be a novel framework for understanding the neural basis of mental processes, improving clinical management and treatment of neurological patients. By developing and delivering these neurocomputational models, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain-mind relationship, ultimately leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of neurological disorders.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind\n\nThis proposal aims to develop and deliver neurocomputational models that bridge the gap between brain and mind, advancing our understanding of mental processes and their neural underpinnings. The project seeks to converge methods from cognitive science and systems neuroscience to investigate complex mental behaviors, map neural systems, and develop novel tools to link brain function to mental behavior. By integrating experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies, we will create a new type of neurocomputational model that simulates detailed cognitive behavior and connects neuroanatomy to cognition.\n\nThe project's primary goals are to establish methods and tools for systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience, plan and execute neuroscience and cognitive methods simultaneously, and force a convergence of results. Our neurocomputational models will mimic normal and impaired behavior, providing a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. This will ultimately improve our understanding of the nature of mental processes, how they arise from neural machinery, and the basis of neurological patients' impairments, leading to improved clinical management and treatment.\n\nBy achieving these goals, this project will contribute significantly to the field of cognitive neuroscience, enabling a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between brain and mind. The developed neurocomputational models will have far-reaching implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders, ultimately improving the lives of individuals affected by these conditions.",

We will provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition, enabling the improvement of clinical management and treatment of neurological patients.\n\nBy developing and delivering neurocomputational models that reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function, we will gain a deeper understanding of the nature of mental processes, how they arise from neural machinery, and the basis of neurological patients' impairments. This project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain-mind relationship, ultimately leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and care for individuals with neurological disorders."
