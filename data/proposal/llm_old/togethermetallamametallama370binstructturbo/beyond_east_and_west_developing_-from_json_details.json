        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\n\nThis innovative project seeks to bridge the cultural divide between Eastern and Western musical traditions, fostering a new era of transcultural collaboration and artistic expression. Focusing on Turkey's rich musical heritage, our interdisciplinary approach will integrate traditional instruments and vocal techniques into contemporary concert music, training both Turkish and Western musicians in new repertoire and techniques.\n\nThrough a series of research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, we will develop and refine a novel ensemble interface featuring newly designed instruments. Our research will also explore the impact of music on musicians and audiences, producing studies on timbre and establishing a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nThe project's outputs will include an e-book, \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" to be published by Cambridge University Press, as well as an orchestration manual and online audio and visual examples. These resources will provide a model for transcultural musical practice, overcoming cultural barriers and promoting cross-cultural understanding. By pushing the boundaries of musical collaboration and innovation, this project has the potential to inspire a new generation of musicians and music lovers, enriching the global musical landscape.",

Focusing on Turkey's rich musical heritage, our objectives are to integrate traditional Turkish instruments and vocal techniques into contemporary concert music, train musicians from both traditions in new repertoire, and develop novel approaches to modeling the impact of music on musicians and audiences.\n\nThrough a series of research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, we will bring together traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers, Western musicians, and musicologists to explore new sounds, techniques, and ensemble interfaces. Our activities will include performance training, instrument design, timbre studies, and the development of a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nThe project's outputs will include an e-book, \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" published by Cambridge University Press, an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds, and online audio and visual examples. By providing a model for transcultural musical practice, we aim to overcome cultural barriers and create a new paradigm for musical collaboration and creativity. Our ultimate goal is to enrich the global musical landscape, promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange through the universal language of music.",
        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\n\nThis project seeks to integrate Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music, fostering a new era of transcultural collaboration and understanding. Through a series of research workshops, performance training sessions, and instrument design initiatives, we will bring together traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers with Western musicians to develop a novel, East-West ensemble interface. This interface will facilitate the creation of new repertoire, showcasing the unique timbres and tuning systems of Turkish music within a contemporary Western framework.\n\nOur objectives include training traditional musicians in new repertoire, Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques, and developing approaches to model the impact of music on musicians and audiences. We will also produce in-depth studies on timbre and establish a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems. The project's outputs will include an e-book, orchestration manual, and online audio and visual examples, to be published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide a model for transcultural musical practice, demonstrating how cultural barriers can be overcome through collaborative music-making. By pushing the boundaries of traditional and contemporary music, we will create a new, inclusive musical landscape that celebrates the diversity of Turkish and Western musical traditions."
