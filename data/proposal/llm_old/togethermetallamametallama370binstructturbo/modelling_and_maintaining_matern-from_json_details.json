        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health (HealthyMom)\n\nThe HealthyMom project aims to investigate the impact of pregnancy loss on maternal mental health, focusing on the neural, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to mental health vulnerabilities. Our objectives are fourfold: (1) to identify traces of unwanted terminated pregnancy in the female brain, (2) to understand the reversal of motherhood-associated changes in brain anatomy and function after pregnancy loss, (3) to identify determinants of afflicted mental health post-pregnancy loss, and (4) to uncover relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors for mental health maintenance.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will acquire longitudinal data from women who have experienced early miscarriage or stillbirth, conducting repeated brain imaging and hormonal assessments, as well as comprehensive mental health monitoring. We will also perform whole genome sequencing of women and their life partners, and utilize detailed surveys to correlate findings. Our approach will leverage cutting-edge tools in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry.\n\nWe expect the HealthyMom project to yield significant insights into female-specific brain dynamics, reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability, and identify targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential benefits for women's health and, indirectly, the health of future offspring. By elucidating the complex relationships between pregnancy loss, brain function, and mental health, we can inform the development of effective interventions and improve maternal mental health outcomes.",

        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health: The HealthyMom Project\n\nThe HealthyMom project aims to elucidate the complex relationships between pregnancy loss, brain dynamics, and mental health in women. Despite the significant impact of pregnancy loss on maternal mental wellbeing, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project will leverage cutting-edge methods in multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry to investigate the effects of early and late pregnancy loss on women's mental health. We will acquire longitudinal data through repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessments, and comprehensive mental health monitoring, complemented by whole genome sequencing of women and their life partners. By integrating these data, we will identify female-specific brain dynamics, neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability, and targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The expected outcomes of this project will have significant implications for women's health and, indirectly, the health of future offspring. Ultimately, the HealthyMom project will provide critical insights into the preservation of maternal mental wellbeing, informing the development of novel interventions and strategies for supporting women following pregnancy loss."
