        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital\n\nThis project investigates the causal relationships between public policy, income, and child health and human capital development in Spain, focusing on the \"missing middle\" period of childhood (0-15 years). Using a large sample of administrative data spanning 35 years, we will employ cutting-edge econometric techniques to estimate the impact of various policy interventions and shocks on child outcomes. Our study will examine the effects of changes in household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks on hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores.\n\nOur research is grounded in the fetal origins hypothesis, which posits that early life experiences have lasting impacts on health and human capital. We will explore potential channels through which policy interventions influence child development, including family size, parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. This project's findings will have significant policy implications, informing evidence-based decisions to improve child health and human capital outcomes in Spain. By shedding light on the causal effects of policy and income on child development, our study will contribute to the development of effective strategies to support vulnerable populations and promote economic growth.",

The study's findings will have significant policy implications, informing the design of effective interventions to improve child health and human capital outcomes in Spain and beyond. By providing causal evidence on the impact of public policy and income on child development, this project aims to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies that promote healthy and productive childhoods.",

The large sample size and longitudinal design of the study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between policy, income, and child outcomes, ultimately informing strategies to improve the well-being of children in Spain and beyond."
