        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nThis project pioneers a comprehensive social demography of widowhood, a growing concern in ageing societies where widowhood survival benefits are being cut in many countries. Despite its increasing relevance, widowhood research lags behind divorce studies. Our innovative approach addresses this gap by examining widowhood through four pillars: risk and vulnerability, social inequalities, country differences, and changes over time. We will utilize high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, spanning 1985 to 2050, to provide systematic estimates and insights into the challenges facing widowed individuals and their families. Our conceptual approach considers both the probability and duration of widowhood's impact on mental health and economic consequences. By doing so, our research will facilitate new studies on sustainable pension and elder care systems, ultimately informing policy and practice to support the growing widowed population.",
        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nAs ageing societies experience an increasing trend of widowhood, understanding its implications on individuals and families becomes crucial. Despite its growing relevance, research on widowhood remains underdeveloped compared to divorce, with current assessments limited to changes in wellbeing after bereavement and focusing on unexpected deaths. This project addresses these gaps by establishing a social demography of widowhood, examining the probability and duration of risk, as well as mental health and economic consequences of vulnerability.\n\nThe project is structured around four pillars: risk and vulnerability, social inequalities, country differences, and change over time. Using harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, spanning 1985 to 2050, and advanced statistical methods, this study will provide systematic and comprehensive estimates of widowhood's impact. The research will shed light on the challenges facing the widowed population and their family members, informing the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems.\n\nBy investigating the complex dynamics of widowhood, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and economic implications of ageing societies, ultimately informing policies that promote the wellbeing of vulnerable populations.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nAs ageing societies experience a growing incidence of widowhood, understanding its social demographic implications is crucial for informing sustainable pension and elder care systems. Despite its increasing relevance, research on widowhood remains underdeveloped compared to divorce, with current assessments limited by their focus on unexpected deaths and change in wellbeing after bereavement. This project addresses these gaps by establishing a comprehensive social demography of widowhood, examining the probability and duration of risk, as well as the mental health and economic consequences of vulnerability.\n\nThe project's four pillars will investigate risk and vulnerability, social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age, country differences, and changes over time. Leveraging high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries between 1985 and 2050, advanced statistical methods will be employed to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates. The project's outcomes will offer insights into the challenges facing the widowed population and their family members, facilitating new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems. By providing a nuanced understanding of widowhood in ageing societies, this project will inform policy and practice, ultimately improving the lives of millions of individuals worldwide."
