        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\n\nThis innovative research project investigates the systematic and meaningful communication in great ape gestures, shedding light on the evolution of human language. By examining the cultural variation in ape gestures across species, physical environments, and social interactions, we aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of ape communication. Specifically, our objectives are to: (1) document and analyze cultural variation in ape gesture; (2) determine how combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and construct meaning; and (3) compare human-ape gesture use and comprehension among adults and children.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a comprehensive approach, collecting data from 17 ape and 9 human groups across Africa. We will study species-specific, environmental, and social factors influencing gesture acquisition and use, and analyze signal combination and meaning construction in ape communication. By comparing gesture use and comprehension between humans and apes, we will gain insights into the evolutionary roots of human language.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its potential to address the fundamental question of human language evolution and explore core language features, such as social learning and syntactic structure, in the context of ape communication. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins of human language, informing theories of language development and acquisition. Ultimately, this project will provide a new perspective on the evolution of human language, highlighting the importance of gestural communication in our closest living relatives, the great apes.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\n\nThis project explores the systematic and meaningful communication in great ape gestures, shedding light on the evolution of human language. Through a comprehensive pan-African study, we will investigate cultural variation in ape gesture across species, physical environments, and social interactions. We will also examine how combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and analyze the construction of meaning. Furthermore, we will conduct a human-ape gesture comparison in both use and comprehension among adults and children. \n\nOur research will involve data collection across 17 ape and 9 human groups, analyzing species-specific, environmental, and social factors in gesture acquisition and use. By exploring core language features such as social learning and syntactic structure in the context of ape communication, this project addresses the fundamental question of human language evolution. The findings of this study will significantly advance our understanding of the origins of human language and have important implications for fields such as linguistics, anthropology, and cognitive science.",

By investigating the linguistic features of ape communication, we can better understand the evolutionary precursors to human language and the universal principles that govern communication across species. Our findings will have important implications for the fields of linguistics, primatology, and cognitive science, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of human language."
