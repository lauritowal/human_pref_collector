        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nThis proposal seeks to elucidate the fundamental distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. To achieve this, we will employ a multi-track approach, combining behavioral and brain imaging methods to investigate three key aspects of conscious and unconscious processing.\n\nIn Track 1, we will utilize Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli, examining unconscious perception and the sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences on behavior. Track 2 will focus on conscious perception, employing a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents and specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions. Finally, in Track 3, we will explore the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, investigating whether the development of consciousness is driven by the maturation of posterior or anterior brain regions.\n\nThis project is expected to have a significant impact on our understanding of the human mind, providing evidence for the existence of sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, specifying the cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual illusions, and offering new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. By shedding light on the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition and behavior, with implications for fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and education.",

        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nThis interdisciplinary project aims to elucidate the complex interplay between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. By combining behavioral and brain imaging methods, we will investigate three complementary tracks: unconscious perception, conscious perception, and the maturation of consciousness. \n\nIn Track 1, we will employ Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli, exploring the presentation of sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences. Track 2 will utilize a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents, specifying the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions. In Track 3, we will investigate the development of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, examining whether consciousness matures through the development of posterior or anterior brain regions.\n\nThis project's expected impact is threefold: it will provide evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, shed light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual illusions, and offer new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. By integrating these three tracks, we will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes, ultimately informing theories of human perception, cognition, and consciousness."
