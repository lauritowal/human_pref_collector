        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive, multi-scalar analysis of the adoption, reformulation, and effects of school autonomy and accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector globally. In response to inconclusive and mixed findings in existing research, REFORMED aims to investigate the dissemination of SAWA policies, policy convergence in education, and the contextual and institutional circumstances of SAWA policies. The project will examine the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity, focusing on institutional frameworks, policy enactment processes, and the role of international bureaucrats, teachers, and other actors involved. Using a robust, multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, REFORMED will analyze SAWA policies across a range of countries, administrative traditions, and levels of development, with a particular focus on the OECD's promotion of these policies globally. By exploring the stages of policy analysis from inception to effects in multiple contexts, this project will provide a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping education reform and inform evidence-based policy decisions.",
        "Here is a 280-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive, multi-scalar analysis of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector worldwide. Despite global reform pressures, the adoption and effects of SAWA policies remain poorly understood, with inconclusive and mixed findings in existing research. REFORMED addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the dissemination of SAWA policies, policy convergence in education, and the contextual and institutional circumstances of these policies. The project also examines the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity.\n\nUsing a robust, multi-scalar methodological strategy combining quantitative and qualitative methods, REFORMED will analyze SAWA policies across a range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development. The project focuses on the inception of SAWA policies in global agendas, their operationalization, and effects in multiple contexts, involving international bureaucrats, teachers, and other key actors. By examining institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes, REFORMED will provide a nuanced understanding of SAWA policies' effects at the school level. The project's findings will have significant implications for education policy and practice, informing efforts to promote equity and improve learning outcomes globally. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will be a key partner in this project, ensuring the global promotion of evidence-based policy recommendations.",
        "Here is a 280-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThis project investigates the global dissemination and implementation of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector. Despite the widespread adoption of SAWA policies, research has yielded inconclusive and mixed findings on their effects. The REFORMED project addresses these knowledge gaps by examining the adoption, reformulation, and effects of SAWA policies across a range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development. We will analyze the role of international organizations, such as the OECD, in promoting SAWA policies globally. Our comprehensive research approach combines quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the inception of SAWA policies in global agendas, their operationalization, and effects in multiple contexts. We will focus on the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes involving international bureaucrats, teachers, and other actors. The project's multi-scalar analysis will explore the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity at the school level. By shedding light on the contextual and institutional circumstances of SAWA policies, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of policy convergence in education and inform evidence-based policy decisions."
