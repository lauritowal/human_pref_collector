        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe\n\nThis project reexamines the process of modernization in Jewish culture during the early modern period, arguing that it was characterized by the importation of new ideas rather than a radical break with tradition. Focusing on the role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, this study reveals how Jewish translators actively engaged with their sources, creating a new, distinctly Jewish corpus that was in dialogue with majority culture. Through a comprehensive analysis of these translations, this project will provide new insights into the intercultural encounters between Christians and Jews at the onset of modernity. By doing so, it will propose a new paradigm for understanding the early modern 'Jewish book' and Jewish modernization, challenging prevailing narratives of Jewish cultural development. The project's findings will have significant implications for our understanding of cultural exchange, translation, and the development of modern Jewish identity.",
