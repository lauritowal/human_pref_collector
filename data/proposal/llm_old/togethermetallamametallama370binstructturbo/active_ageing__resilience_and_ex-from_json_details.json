        "Title: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of active ageing, a crucial aspect of healthy ageing, and to design and test a multicomponent intervention to promote it. The project aims to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and produce evidence for its promotion. The proposed research will develop a scale for assessing active ageing, based on the World Health Organization's definition, with four dimensions: ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy. The study will examine the determinants and modifiers of active ageing, including resilience and external support, using a cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85. A randomized controlled trial with 200 participants will test the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention, which will combine counselling, information technology, and volunteer support. The project will also compare the current findings with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago to study cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. The proposed research will employ state-of-the-art statistical methods to analyze the data. The expected outcomes of this project include a novel scale for active ageing, training for young scientists, and new concepts and theory development. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies to promote active ageing and improve the health and wellbeing of older adults.",
        "Here is a 309-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThis proposal aims to advance our understanding of active ageing and develop a novel intervention to promote healthy ageing. The project's primary objectives are to create a multidimensional scale for assessing active ageing, examine its determinants and modifiers, and design a sustainable intervention to foster active ageing. The proposed scale will be based on the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing and will comprise four dimensions: ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy.\n\nThe study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining counselling, information technology, and volunteer support. A cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85 will be recruited for the scale development phase. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants will be conducted to test the intervention's feasibility and effectiveness. The project will also leverage pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago to examine cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing.\n\nThis project's expected outcomes include the development of a novel scale for active ageing, the creation of new knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing, and the production of evidence for active ageing promotion. Additionally, the project will provide training opportunities for young scientists and contribute to the development of new concepts and theories in the field. Ultimately, the proposed project has the potential to make a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of older adults, enabling them to maintain their independence and quality of life as they age.",
        "Here is a 309-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop and test a novel approach to promoting active ageing, focusing on the interplay between individual resilience and external support in preventing disablement. Our project aims to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and produce evidence-based strategies for its promotion. We will develop a multidimensional scale for assessing active ageing, grounded in the World Health Organization's definition, which will include ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy dimensions. A cross-sectional study of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85 will inform the scale's development and provide insights into the determinants of active ageing. We will then design and test a multicomponent intervention, incorporating counselling, information technology, and volunteer support, in a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants. By comparing our findings to pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago, we will examine cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. Our project will not only generate new knowledge but also provide training opportunities for young scientists and contribute to the development of new concepts and theory in the field of gerontology. Ultimately, our research will yield a novel scale for active ageing, informing the development of effective interventions to promote healthy ageing and improve the quality of life for older adults."
