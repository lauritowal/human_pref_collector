        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe (ReAct)\n\nThis project, ReAct, undertakes a groundbreaking examination of the cultural memory of protest in Europe from the late 19th century to the present day. Through a comprehensive analysis of texts, images, and commemorative practices, ReAct will reveal the continuities and changes in the depiction of protest across different media regimes, demonstrating how memories of past activism inform and shape subsequent social movements. The project's innovative design encompasses three study periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012) and three lines of inquiry: mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. Network visualization will be used to map the reproduction of narratives and references, providing a nuanced understanding of how memories of protest are transmitted and transformed over time.\n\nReAct's findings will have significant implications for cultural memory research, social movement studies, and our understanding of collective identity. By developing analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope and opening up a new area of social movement research, this project will contribute to a major reorientation in the field. Ultimately, ReAct will provide critical literacies for rethinking collective memory and identity, informing a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between past, present, and future activism.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe (ReAct)\n\nThis project proposes a groundbreaking investigation into the cultural memory of protest in Europe, spanning from the late 19th century to the present day. ReAct aims to provide the first in-depth account of how activism has been remembered and forgotten across different media regimes, examining the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in shaping our understanding of protest. Through a comparative analysis of three distinct periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012), this project will reveal continuities and changes in the depiction of protest, and demonstrate how memories of past movements inform and inspire later ones.\n\nBy employing innovative methodologies, including network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references, ReAct will contribute to a major reorientation in cultural memory research. The project's findings will also develop analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, open up new areas of social movement research, and provide critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity. Ultimately, ReAct will deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between protest, memory, and social change, informing more effective strategies for promoting social justice and human rights.",

By examining the remembering and forgetting of protest movements across different media regimes, ReAct will reveal continuities and changes in the depiction of protest, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying protest memory, and show how this memory informs later movements. The project will employ a novel design, incorporating three study periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012) and three lines of inquiry (mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes). Innovative network visualization techniques will be used to map the reproduction of narratives and references. The project's findings will have major implications for cultural memory research, social movement studies, and our understanding of collective identity and memory. By developing analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, ReAct will provide critical literacies for rethinking these concepts. Ultimately, this project will open up a new area of research, shedding light on the complex dynamics of protest memory and its impact on social change."
