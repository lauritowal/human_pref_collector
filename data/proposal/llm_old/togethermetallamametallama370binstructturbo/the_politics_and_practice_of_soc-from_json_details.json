        "Here is a 262-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\n\nThis five-year project aims to investigate the complex relationship between social media and conflict, with a specific focus on Africa, particularly Eastern Africa. The initiative seeks to extend internet reach to remote regions and improve affordable access to the world's poorest populations in non-urban areas with weak state presence, where protracted violent conflict is prevalent. Our research will explore the key puzzle of whether social media access promotes peace-building or perpetuates violence in conflict-affected communities.\n\nThrough a comprehensive examination of the interplay between social media and conflict, we will address three primary research questions: How does social media alter transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How do public authorities use social media to encourage violence or promote peace? And, how is social media changing people's experiences with violent conflict? Our analysis will be situated within four contexts: dangerous speech online, exit and entry of individuals from/into conflict, actors' tactics to shape the Internet, and governance actors' use of social media.\n\nBy shedding light on the dynamics of social media in conflict settings, this project will provide critical insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars working to promote peace and stability in Africa. Our findings will inform strategies for harnessing social media to build peace and mitigate violence, ultimately contributing to more effective conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts in the region.",

Our goal is to extend internet reach to remote regions and improve affordable access to social media, particularly among the world's poorest communities in regions with weak state institutions and protracted violent conflict. We aim to investigate the key puzzle of whether increased social media access promotes peace-building or perpetuates violence in conflict-affected communities.\n\nOur research will examine how social media alters transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, how public authorities use social media to encourage violence or promote peace, and how social media is changing people's experiences with violent conflict. We will investigate these questions in the contexts of dangerous speech online, the exit and entry of individuals from/into conflict, actors' tactics to shape the internet, and governance actors' use of social media.\n\nThrough a nuanced understanding of the interplay between social media and conflict, this project seeks to inform policies and practices that can mitigate the negative consequences of social media on conflict and promote its potential for peace-building. Our findings will have significant implications for conflict-affected communities in Africa, particularly in Eastern Africa, where religious and political violence are pervasive. By shedding light on the politics and practice of social media in conflict, this project can contribute to more effective and sustainable peace-building initiatives in the region."
