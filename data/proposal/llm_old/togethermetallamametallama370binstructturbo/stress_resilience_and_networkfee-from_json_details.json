        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a novel framework to understand the neural adaptations that occur in response to acute stress, with the ultimate goal of identifying transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience and developing a method for training stress resilience. We hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale neural networks, leading to changes in cognitive function and behavior. To investigate this, we will characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during acute stress and recovery, identify neural markers predicting resilience to stress using wearable biosensors and mobile apps, and cross-validate these markers in a patient group with high stress sensitivity. We will also examine the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts and test the disruption of cognitive functions by shifting network balance. Finally, we will develop a functional MRI neurofeedback approach to train adaptive reallocation of neural resources, promoting stress resilience. Our approach will utilize network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback to target large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying stress resilience and developing a novel training method, this project has the potential to provide significant insight into brain adaptation to acute stress and improve mental health outcomes.",
        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying stress resilience and develop a novel method for training stress resilience using network-feedback training. Acute stress is a pervasive problem that can have debilitating effects on mental and physical health, yet the brain's adaptive response to stress remains poorly understood. Our project aims to address this knowledge gap by characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale neural network shifts during acute stress and recovery. We will employ a multimodal approach, combining network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback to identify neural markers that predict resilience to stress.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale networks, leading to impaired higher-order cognition. We will test this hypothesis by examining the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts and investigating how these shifts disrupt cognitive functions. The proposed project will have a significant impact on our understanding of brain adaptation to acute stress, providing insight into transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience vs sensitivity. Furthermore, our project will develop a novel method for training stress resilience using fMRI neurofeedback, which has the potential to improve mental health outcomes in individuals exposed to acute stress. Ultimately, this project will provide a novel framework for understanding alterations in neural systems due to acute stress and develop a innovative approach for promoting stress resilience.",

The proposed research has the potential to transform our understanding of the neural basis of stress and inform the development of novel interventions for stress-related disorders.
