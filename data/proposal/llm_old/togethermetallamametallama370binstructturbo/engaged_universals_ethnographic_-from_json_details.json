        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of 'Universal Health Coverage' and the Public Good in Africa\n\nThis anthropological project investigates the interpretation and implementation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries, examining its impact on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions. UHC, a key Sustainable Development Goal, aims to ensure that all people can access essential health services without financial hardship. However, its pursuit in Africa is hindered by historical issues such as structural adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, and privatization, which have led to a burden of payment on the poor and neglect of national healthcare systems. This project explores how UHC is implemented and perceived at global, national, and local levels, focusing on the interactions between actors and institutions, formal systems of social protection, informal social networks supporting health, and national histories. Using a multi-sited, multi-level ethnographic approach, this study will provide new research directions and knowledge relevant beyond Africa, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities of achieving UHC in the region. By examining the complexities of UHC in Africa, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the public good and state responsibility in promoting health equity and social justice.",

By exploring national histories and social practices, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by UHC in Africa, including the partial pursuit by African states, conflicting interests, and contested fields.\n\nThis project is expected to contribute new research directions and knowledge relevant beyond Africa, illuminating the complexities of implementing UHC in diverse contexts. By examining how UHC is interpreted and implemented in Africa, this research will offer valuable insights into the role of the state in ensuring the public good and promoting health equity, ultimately informing policies that prioritize the well-being of citizens and the strengthening of national health-care systems.",
