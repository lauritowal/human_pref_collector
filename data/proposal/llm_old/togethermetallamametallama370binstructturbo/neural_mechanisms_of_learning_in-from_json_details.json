        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\nThis proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying learning in the infant brain, focusing on the critical period from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. We aim to investigate how infants develop statistical inferences, rules, and symbolic representations in two key domains: language and complex social interactions. Our approach will integrate multiple techniques, including EEG, MRI, and optical topography, to non-invasively probe the developing brain. The project is organized into six work packages, each tackling a specific aspect of infant learning.\n\nWe will explore how infants perform statistical computations using auditory oddball paradigms (WP1) and how pre-term environments influence these abilities (WP2). We will also examine the neural bases of word meaning and category inference (WP3) and establish criteria for infant symbolic competency (WP4). Furthermore, we will use MRI to localize functional activity and identify maturational markers (WP5). Finally, we will develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis (WP6).\n\nBy clarifying the specificities of the neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits, this project will provide a fundamental understanding of the early emergence of cognitive abilities. Our findings will have significant implications for the development of novel interventions and therapies for learning disorders, ultimately enhancing our capacity to support optimal cognitive development in infancy.",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Neural Mechanisms of Learning in the Infant Brain: From Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\nThis project aims to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying human learning from the earliest stages of cortical development. Focusing on the infant brain, we will investigate the emergence of complex cognitive abilities in the domains of language and social interactions. Our proposal centers on the idea that access to a rich symbolic system is rooted in the human cerebral architecture, which enables the transition from statistical inferences to rule-based understanding.\n\nOver the course of six work packages, we will employ a multimodal neuroimaging approach, combining EEG, MRI, and optical topography, to study the infant brain from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. Our work packages will address specific research questions, including the development of age-specific statistical inferences, the impact of pre-term environments on early statistical computations, and the neural bases of word meaning and category inference. Additionally, we will establish criteria for infant symbolic competency and develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying human learning, we hope to provide fundamental insights into the development of cognitive abilities and inform strategies for early intervention and education. Our findings have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human learning and its neural basis, with far-reaching implications for fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and education.",

Our research will investigate how infants transition from statistical inferences to rule-based understanding and symbolic comprehension, leveraging cutting-edge techniques including EEG, MRI, and optical topography. The project consists of six work packages, each addressing a critical aspect of infant learning. We will explore age-related changes in statistical inferences using auditory oddball paradigms, examine the impact of pre-term environments on early statistical computations, and uncover the neural bases of word meaning and category inference. Additionally, we will establish criteria for infant symbolic competency, map functional localization and maturational markers using MRI, and develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis. By clarifying the specificities of the neural functional architecture critical for human learning, this project will provide fundamental insights into the origins of human cognition and inform strategies for early intervention and education. Ultimately, our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how the infant brain lays the foundation for lifelong learning and development."
