        "Here is a 275-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\n\nThis project challenges traditional views of inequality in prehistoric Europe by positing that social disparities manifested situationally, rather than overtly, through the lens of death and ancestorhood. Through a novel combination of osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, we will empirically test this hypothesis in Peninsular Italy, a region critical to understanding European prehistory.\n\nOur research will span three key periods: the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC). We will analyze 200 individuals per period, providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how inequality affected lives and the role of ancestors in prehistoric societies.\n\nBy evaluating the treatment of the dead and the construction of ancestral identities, we will uncover the complex power dynamics at play in prehistoric Europe. Our approach will move beyond simplistic notions of social hierarchy, instead revealing the subtle, context-dependent ways in which inequality was negotiated and contested.\n\nUltimately, \"Making Ancestors\" will provide a groundbreaking new perspective on the politics of death in prehistoric Europe, shedding light on the intricate relationships between inequality, power, and the construction of social identity. By pushing the boundaries of current understanding, this project will have significant implications for the field of archaeology and beyond.",

Through a critical examination of deathways and ancestor veneration, we will evaluate how inequality affected lives and understand the role of ancestors in prehistoric societies. Our research will focus on Peninsular Italy, with a comprehensive analysis of 600 individuals across three key periods: the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), the Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and the Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC).\n\nWe will employ innovative methodologies, including osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, to reconstruct the lives and deaths of individuals and identify patterns of inequality. By analyzing 200 individuals per period, we will gain a nuanced understanding of how social dynamics and power structures influenced death practices and ancestor veneration. Our research goals are twofold: to evaluate how inequality affected lives and to understand the role of ancestors in prehistoric societies. This project will provide a groundbreaking new perspective on the politics of death in prehistoric Europe, offering insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of inequality in ancient societies.",

By examining the treatment of the dead and the construction of ancestral identities, we will uncover the ways in which inequality was experienced, negotiated, and contested in prehistoric Europe. Our project will contribute significantly to the field of archaeology, offering a more complex and nuanced understanding of social organization and power relations in the past. Ultimately, \"Making Ancestors\" will provide a new framework for understanding the politics of death and the dynamics of inequality in prehistoric societies, shedding light on the lives and experiences of individuals often marginalized in traditional narratives."
