        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects\n\nThis project aims to uncover the role of effort in perpetuating social inequality, with a focus on intergenerational mobility and equality of opportunity. We will investigate how children's effort levels vary by parental socioeconomic background, and whether disparities in effort can be explained by the intergenerational transmission of effort and motivations. To achieve this, we will develop and utilize cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry.\n\nOur study will involve school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany, with a mixed-methods approach combining experimental data collection, analysis of subjective effort dispositions using international surveys, and triangulation of methodologies. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of effort and its relationship to social inequality.\n\nThe project's potential impacts are far-reaching. We expect to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity, and offer insights for educational practitioners. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design, informing strategies to promote greater equality of opportunity. By shedding light on the complex relationship between effort and social inequality, this project has the potential to drive meaningful social change.",
        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects\n\nThis project aims to investigate the role of effort in the reproduction of social inequality, advancing our understanding of intergenerational mobility and promoting equality of opportunity. We will explore how children's effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background, and whether existing disparities can be explained by the intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations. To achieve this, we will develop and employ cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry, in a sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. Our mixed-methods approach will combine experimental data collection with analysis of subjective effort dispositions using national and international surveys, triangulation of methodologies, and cross-validation analysis. This project has the potential to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity, and offer insights for educational practitioners. Furthermore, our findings will contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design, ultimately informing strategies to promote greater equality of opportunity. By shedding light on the complex relationships between effort, social background, and inequality, this project will have significant implications for our understanding of social mobility and the development of evidence-based policies to address social inequality.",

To achieve this, we will develop and employ cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry. Our sample will consist of school-age children and their parents from Spain and Germany. We will collect experimental data, analyze subjective effort dispositions using international surveys, and triangulate methodologies to ensure robust findings. This project has the potential to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity, and offer insights for educational practitioners. Furthermore, our research will contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design. By advancing our understanding of how effort contributes to social inequality, this project can inform strategies to promote greater equality of opportunity and reduce the persistence of social inequality."
