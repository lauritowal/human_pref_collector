        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Knowledge For Use (K4U): Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nThe Knowledge For Use (K4U) project aims to construct a new approach to leveraging social science for the development of better social policies. Currently, there is an overemphasis on knowledge production, with inadequate attention paid to knowledge use. This imbalance hinders the effective translation of social science research into policy practice. K4U seeks to address this gap by developing a practical understanding of policy design and deliberation that balances effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability.\n\nGrounded in a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U will reconceptualize objectivity and deliberation, and examine the role of values in the science-society interface. By integrating philosophical inquiry with empirical analysis, K4U will provide intelligible and practical insights for users to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies. This innovative approach will contribute to the development of \"philosophy for practice\" and launch the field of philosophy of social technology.\n\nThrough K4U, we will provide policymakers and stakeholders with a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in policy design and implementation. By bridging the gap between social science research and policy practice, K4U will ultimately inform more effective, evidence-based policies that address the needs of diverse stakeholders. This project has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of better social policies, and we believe it aligns perfectly with the goals of the Horizon 2020 program.",
        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nThe Knowledge For Use (K4U) project aims to revolutionize the way social science is used to inform policy-making, by developing a novel approach that prioritizes practical application over knowledge production. Current social science research often neglects the critical step of translating knowledge into actionable policies, resulting in a lack of effective and evidence-based decision-making. K4U addresses this gap by focusing on the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation, and examining the role of values in the science-society interface. \n\nBuilding on a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U will develop a practical understanding of policy design and deliberation, balancing key factors such as effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. By launching the philosophy of social technology field, K4U will provide intelligible and practical insights for users to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies. Ultimately, K4U will contribute to more informed and effective policy-making, enhancing the impact of social science on society.",
        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nThe Knowledge For Use (K4U) project proposes a groundbreaking approach to harnessing social science for more effective policy-making. Funded under the Horizon 2020 program, K4U aims to develop a novel framework for using social science to inform policy design and deliberation. Current approaches often prioritize knowledge production over knowledge use, resulting in a disconnect between research and policy outcomes. To address this, K4U will focus on a philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation, and examining the role of values in the science-society interface.\n\nBuilding on a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U will develop a practical understanding of policy design and deliberation, balancing key factors such as effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. By providing intelligible and practical insights, K4U will enable users to estimate and balance these aspects of proposed policies, ultimately leading to better-informed decision-making. The project's contributions will be twofold: advancing \"philosophy for practice\" and launching the field of philosophy of social technology. By bridging the gap between social science and policy-making, K4U has the potential to significantly improve the impact and effectiveness of social policies."
