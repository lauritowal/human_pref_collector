        "Here is a 295-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600\n\nThis project challenges traditional top-down approaches to state formation in Western Europe between 1300 and 1600 by investigating the role of decentralization, representation, and elite support in the rise of states. Contrary to the prevailing assumption that centralization was the primary driver of state formation, our research hypothesizes that the decentralization of legal authority was a crucial factor in the development of states during this period. Through a path-dependency analytical framework, we will examine the interplay between state formation, urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent in five case study regions: Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire.\n\nBy integrating insights from social history, our project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of power and the ways in which elites supported or resisted state-building efforts. This approach will also enable us to question the dominant top-down narrative of state formation, which posits that princes were the primary drivers of centralization. Instead, we will explore the role of bottom-up representation and the ways in which local actors contributed to the development of states. Methodological innovation and integration with research on Central and Eastern Europe will ensure the project's findings have broader implications for our understanding of state formation in medieval and early modern Europe.",

This project's innovative methodology will integrate insights from social history, improving our understanding of power dynamics during this period. Furthermore, our research will be contextualized within the broader European landscape, incorporating comparisons with Central and Eastern Europe. Ultimately, this project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the rise of states in Western Europe, highlighting the significance of decentralized legal authority and elite support in shaping the modern state.",
        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600\n\nThis project challenges conventional wisdom on state formation in Western Europe between 1300 and 1600, questioning the dominant top-down narrative of centralized power consolidation by princes. Instead, we propose a decentralized model, where legal authority was dispersed among various actors, including regional elites and representative institutions. Through a comparative analysis of five regions (Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire), we will examine the interplay between state formation, urbanization, rural socio-economic organization, and ideological dissent. Our path-dependency framework will highlight how local power dynamics and institutional legacies shaped the emergence of states within states. By integrating insights from central and eastern Europe, we will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex, bottom-up processes that drove state formation in Western Europe. This project promises to make a significant contribution to the field of medieval and early modern history, while also innovating methodologically and improving our social history of power."
