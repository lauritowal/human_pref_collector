        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. Through an empirical approach combining lab and field experiments, we aim to understand the mechanisms underlying user engagement and its elicitation, determine its direct value for businesses, and assess its broader societal implications. Our preliminary results suggest that calls to action have a significant effect on conversion rates and information revelation. \n\nIn collaboration with a leading website-development service provider utilizing a freemium business model, this project will characterize the effects of calls to action across multiple product domains and isolate their underlying mechanisms. Our objectives are threefold: to advance the economic understanding of social computing, to contribute to a societal understanding of social computing, and to provide actionable insights for businesses seeking to optimize their online engagement strategies. \n\nThe anticipated impact of this project is twofold. Firstly, it will inform businesses on how to effectively design and implement calls to action, leading to increased conversion rates and revenue. Secondly, it will provide a nuanced understanding of the societal implications of user engagement expectations, enabling policymakers and regulators to make informed decisions about the online environment. By exploring the advantages and pitfalls of elicited online user engagement, this project will contribute to a more informed and effective digital economy.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement\n\nThis project proposes an interdisciplinary investigation into the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. Through a mixed-methods approach combining empirical analysis, lab experiments, and field experiments, we aim to understand the mechanisms underlying user engagement and its elicitation, as well as the direct value it brings to businesses and its broader societal implications. Our preliminary results suggest that calls to action have a significant effect on conversion rates and information revelation. \n\nIn collaboration with a leading website-development service provider operating on a freemium business model, we will characterize the effects of calls to action across multiple product domains and isolate the underlying mechanisms driving their success. This research will provide a nuanced understanding of the economic and societal implications of social computing, informing businesses on how to effectively leverage calls to action while also considering the potential consequences of creating user engagement expectations. \n\nOur anticipated outcomes include a comprehensive framework for understanding the advantages and pitfalls of elicited online user engagement, as well as actionable insights for businesses and policymakers seeking to promote healthy online interactions. By exploring the complex interplay between user engagement, business strategy, and societal well-being, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of social computing and beyond.",
