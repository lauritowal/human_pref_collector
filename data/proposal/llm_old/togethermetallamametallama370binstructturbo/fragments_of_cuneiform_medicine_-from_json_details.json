        "Here is a 239-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Fragments of Cuneiform Medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity (BabMed)\n\nThis project, BabMed, proposes the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. Focusing on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as recorded in the Babylonian Talmud, written in Aramaic, we will challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories by exploring the transfer of knowledge between ancient civilizations. Our study hypothesizes that cuneiform survived longer than previously thought and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud largely derives from Akkadian medicine. Employing native taxonomies, we will compare Babylonian medicine with neighboring systems, including Greek medicine, to establish a new paradigm for knowledge transfer. By overcoming the barriers of script and language, we will demonstrate how Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud. This unique text, situated in the geographical context of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia, mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds. BabMed represents the largest ancient collection of medical data before Hippocrates, offering a groundbreaking opportunity to reevaluate the history of medicine and its transmission across ancient civilizations.",

Our research will demonstrate that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud. By exploring this vast, pre-Hippocratic collection of medical data, BabMed will revolutionize our understanding of knowledge transfer in Late Antiquity.",
