        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nThis project proposes a groundbreaking investigation into the shifting landscape of music performance in the twenty-first century. By challenging the traditional conception of music bound to historical texts, we will explore the potential of experimental performance practices and the transferability of scientific experimentation models to music. Through a material engagement with artistic practice and the generation of innovative artistic outputs, we aim to create new paths in music performance and assess the applicability of scientific experimentation principles to the field.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to investigate the traditional conception of music bound to history, to create new paths through experimental practices, and to assess the transferability of scientific experimentation to music. By situating this research within the context of artistic research, we will generate innovative theoretical and practical contributions to the field. The project's outputs will include a change in the field of musical performance, offering alternative approaches to traditional \"interpretation\" and providing opportunities for scholarship and performance practices.\n\nHosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, this project will engage with the discourse of artistic experimentation, pushing the boundaries of music performance and contributing to a deeper understanding of the role of experimentation in artistic practice. The proposed project has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach music performance, offering new insights and innovative practices that will resonate throughout the music community.",
        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the field of music performance by shifting the focus from traditional, text-based practices to innovative, performative-based approaches. Through a combination of theoretical investigation and music practice, we will explore the possibilities of applying scientific experimentation models to music performance, generating new artistic outputs and challenging conventional notions of musical interpretation.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to investigate the historical conception of music performance and its limitations, to create new paths through experimental performance practices, and to assess the transferability of scientific experimentation to music. By engaging with material practices in artistic research, we will develop innovative theories and practices that can transform the field of music performance.\n\nThe Orpheus Research Centre in Music will host this project, which is situated within the discourse of artistic experimentation. The expected contributions of this project include innovations in theory and practice, opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, and concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. The project's outputs will be a change in the field of musical performance, offering a radical alternative to traditional \"interpretation.\" By supporting this project, you will be investing in a pioneering initiative that can reshape the future of music performance in the twenty-first century.",

Through an artistic research approach, we will investigate the potential of experimental performance practices to create new paths in music performance, and assess the transferability of scientific experimentation models to the music domain.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to investigate the traditional conception of music performance bound to historical context, to create new paths through experimental practices, and to assess the transferability of scientific experimentation to music. Our methodologies will involve material engagement in artistic practice, generating artistic outputs that will contribute to innovations in theory and practice. We expect our research to provide opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, as well as concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance.\n\nHosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, this project will consist of theoretical investigation and music practice components. Our anticipated project outputs include a change in the field of musical performance, offering an alternative to traditional \"interpretation\" approaches. By exploring the intersection of artistic experimentation and music performance, this project will contribute to the ongoing discourse on artistic experimentation, expanding our understanding of the possibilities and boundaries of music performance in the twenty-first century."
