        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\n\nThe transition to high school can be a challenging period for many children, marked by peer rejection, victimization, and low support from teachers. These difficulties can negatively impact self-regulation and stress-regulation, ultimately affecting academic performance and overall well-being. To address these issues, our ERC-team proposes the development and implementation of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to promote prosocial behaviors and facilitate a smoother transition to high school.\n\nA.L.I.B.I. is a virtual high school environment where players must uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, engaging in prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and considering multiple response options. The game offers a realistic yet safe learning environment, allowing children to rehearse prosocial behaviors and focus on long-term perspectives. The game's appeal is enhanced by its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer.\n\nOur project aims to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game, assess its effectiveness, and integrate it into ongoing school transition trainings in three regions in The Netherlands. In partnership with three school counseling organizations, we will develop a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. By providing a innovative and engaging tool for children to navigate the challenges of high school transition, we aim to improve their social and emotional well-being, ultimately enhancing their academic success and overall quality of life.",
        "Here is a grant proposal abstract based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\n\nThe transition to high school can be a challenging period for many children, marked by peer rejection, victimization, and conflictual relationships with teachers. These difficulties can negatively impact self-regulation and stress-regulation, hindering academic and social success. This project proposes the development and evaluation of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to support children's transition to high school. A.L.I.B.I. is set in a virtual high school environment, where players uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, engaging in prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and considering multiple response options. The game provides a realistic yet safe learning environment, allowing children to rehearse prosocial behaviors and focus on long-term perspectives.\n\nOur goals are to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone game, assess its effectiveness in improving social and emotional competencies, and integrate it into existing school transition trainings. We will partner with three school counseling organizations to implement the game in three regions in The Netherlands, with plans to expand to Europe. By providing a fun and engaging tool for children to develop essential life skills, we aim to enhance their transition to high school and set them up for future success.",
