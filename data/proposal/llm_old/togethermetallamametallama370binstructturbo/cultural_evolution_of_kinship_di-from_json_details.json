        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time, examining the complex interplay between language, cognition, and social norms. The proposed research integrates macro- and micro-evolutionary approaches to understand how kinship terminologies and family norms change, and how these changes are reflected in language usage and children's acquisition of kinship concepts.\n\nThe project consists of three components: VARIKIN-Evolution, which applies comparative phylogenetic modeling to analyze kinship terminologies across eight language families; VARIKIN-Usage, which employs corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to study the usage of kinship language in spoken and written forms; and VARIKIN-Development, which uses participant observation and elicitation tasks to investigate children's acquisition and understanding of kinship in small-scale, non-Western communities.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to analyze patterns of kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, link individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterize the cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. By integrating insights from linguistics, anthropology, psychology, and cognitive science, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cultural evolution of kinship diversity, shedding light on the universal and variable aspects of human kinship systems. The proposed research has significant implications for our understanding of human sociality, language, and culture, and will contribute to the development of a more nuanced theory of cultural evolution.",
        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\nThis project investigates the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time, exploring how language, cognition, and social norms interact to shape family structures and relationships. The proposed research integrates macro- and micro-evolutionary approaches to examine the universality and variability of kinship patterns, with a focus on three interconnected components. VARIKIN-Evolution employs comparative phylogenetic modeling to analyze kinship terminologies and family norms across eight language families. VARIKIN-Usage combines corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews to investigate the usage of kinship language in spoken and written forms. VARIKIN-Development uses participant observation and elicitation tasks to study children's acquisition and understanding of kinship in a small-scale, non-Western community. The project's objectives are to analyze patterns of kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, link individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterize cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. By integrating insights from linguistics, cognitive science, anthropology, and psychology, this highly multidisciplinary project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the cultural evolution of kinship diversity, shedding light on the complex and dynamic nature of human family systems.",
