        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\n\nThis project proposes to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe, with a focus on hundreds of sites. The research will have an initial impact through the documentation and survey of these monuments, and in the long term, will provide new insights, enable comparative studies, and lead to a deeper conceptualization of these sacred spaces. The study will examine these monuments as icons, maps, networks, and interactive multimedia, exploring their role in shaping space and place. This project will contribute to our understanding of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices.\n\nThe research will involve field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and the grouping of monuments to identify clusters. The project will employ collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, to engage with experts and stakeholders. Throughout the project, various outputs will be published, culminating in a book at the end of the research. By exploring the projections of Jerusalem in Europe, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between space, place, and memory, and shed new light on the cultural and historical significance of these monumental networks.",
        "Here is a 298-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\n\nThis project seeks to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe, with an anticipated scope of hundreds of sites. The research will have both initial and long-term impacts, initially providing thorough documentation and surveys, and ultimately yielding new insights, a comparative study, and a conceptual framework for understanding these monumental networks.\n\nThe study will focus on the icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, space, and place, making significant contributions to the fields of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. The research activities will involve field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, grouping of monuments, and crystallization of clusters.\n\nThe project will employ collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, to facilitate knowledge exchange and ensure the validity of findings. Throughout the research stages, various outputs will be published, culminating in a comprehensive book at the end of the project.\n\nBy examining the projections of Jerusalem in Europe, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the cultural, historical, and religious significance of these monuments, shedding light on the ways in which sacred spaces are recreated and experienced across different contexts. The project's findings will have far-reaching implications for the study of devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between space, place, and identity.",
        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\n\nThis project seeks to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked despite its significance in understanding the complex relationships between pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. By exploring hundreds of sites, we aim to uncover new insights into the ways in which Jerusalem has been imagined, represented, and experienced in Europe across time and space.\n\nThrough a combination of field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and clustering of monuments, we will crystallize patterns and networks that reveal the complexities of this monumental landscape. Our research will involve collaborative discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences to ensure a rigorous and interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThe project's outcomes will be disseminated through various outputs throughout the research stages, culminating in a comprehensive book that presents a new conceptual framework for understanding the projections of Jerusalem in Europe. By shedding light on this understudied topic, our research will contribute significantly to the fields of pilgrimage studies, sacred spaces, and devotionalism, ultimately enriching our understanding of the multifaceted nature of space and place."
