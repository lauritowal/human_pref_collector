        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the impact of technology on corporate practices, investor decision-making, and individual welfare. The project is structured around three pillars. Firstly, we will examine how the shift to virtual-only shareholder meetings has affected communication between corporations and their shareholders. Preliminary findings suggest that this shift has muted shareholders' voices, allowing firms to avoid addressing critical questions. Secondly, we will employ natural language processing to analyze the relationship between firms' stated environmental and social (ES) actions and their actual performance. Initial results indicate that investors reward firms for stating ES goals, rather than actual actions, raising concerns about the efficacy of ES initiatives. Finally, we will explore the relationship between employee characteristics, specifically gender in the tech industry, and their ability to maximize the value of employee benefit compensation (EBC). This research aims to inform policies that promote greater transparency, accountability, and fairness in corporate practices, ultimately contributing to a more prosperous and equitable economic landscape for individuals and investors alike.",
        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project investigates the impact of technology on corporate governance, environmental and social (ES) issues, and employee compensation. The project consists of three interconnected pillars. Pillar 1 examines the effect of virtual-only shareholder meetings on communication between corporations and their shareholders, with preliminary findings suggesting that the shift to virtual meetings has minimized communication and allowed firms to avoid addressing shareholder questions. Pillar 2 employs natural language processing to evaluate the discrepancy between firms' stated and actual actions on ES issues, revealing that the market rewards firms for stating ES goals rather than taking concrete actions. Pillar 3 focuses on the relationship between employees' characteristics, particularly gender in the tech industry, and their ability to maximize the value of employee benefits and compensation (EBC). This research aims to shed light on the consequences of technological advancements on the economic landscape and individual welfare. The project's findings will inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and prosperous business environment.",
        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project investigates the impact of technology on corporate governance, environmental and social (ES) issues, and employee compensation. The project is divided into three pillars, each addressing a critical aspect of the relationship between technology and prosperity.\n\nFirst, we examine the effect of virtual-only shareholder meetings on communication between firms and their investors. Preliminary findings suggest that this shift has muted shareholders' voices and allowed firms to avoid addressing important questions. Second, we employ natural language processing to analyze the gap between firms' stated and actual actions on ES issues. Initial results indicate that markets reward firms for stating ES goals, rather than taking concrete actions. Finally, we investigate the relationship between employee characteristics and their ability to maximize the value of employee benefit compensation (EBC), with a specific focus on gender in the tech industry.\n\nThis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how technology is influencing corporate decision-making, investor behavior, and individual welfare. By exploring these critical issues, we hope to inform policies and practices that promote transparency, accountability, and equitable outcomes in the digital age. The expected outcomes of this project will have significant implications for investors, firms, and individuals, ultimately contributing to a more prosperous and sustainable economic landscape."
