        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Intergroup Tolerance: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nThis proposal seeks to advance our understanding of intergroup tolerance, a crucial aspect of social harmony in increasingly diverse societies. Despite its significance, systematic empirical research on intergroup tolerance is scarce. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the underlying psychological aspects, processes, and limits of tolerance, as well as its social psychological consequences. \n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, this research will provide novel insights into the dynamics of intergroup tolerance. By examining the psychological mechanisms that drive tolerance, we can identify opportunities for intervention and inform strategies to promote harmonious coexistence in diverse societies. \n\nThe expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive understanding of intergroup tolerance, which will contribute to the development of a more tolerant society. The novelty of this research lies in its systematic and empirical approach to a critical social issue, making it a ground-breaking and timely contribution to the field of social sciences. Ultimately, this project has the potential to inform policies and practices that foster greater understanding, respect, and cooperation among diverse groups, promoting a more harmonious and inclusive society.",
        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Intergroup Tolation: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nThis proposal seeks to advance the state of the art in social sciences by investigating the social psychology of intergroup toleration, a crucial aspect of harmonious coexistence in increasingly diverse societies. Despite its importance, systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration remains scarce, making this project both groundbreaking and timely. Our objective is to provide insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society.\n\nThe proposed project comprises four key components: (1) underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, (2) psychological processes underlying tolerance, (3) limits of tolerance, and (4) social psychological consequences of being tolerated. To achieve our objectives, we will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. This innovative research design will enable us to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying intergroup toleration.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive understanding of the nature, processes, and consequences of intergroup toleration, which will inform strategies for promoting tolerance and social cohesion in culturally diverse societies. By addressing the pressing question of how to live harmoniously in diverse societies, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on social sciences and inform policies that foster greater tolerance and understanding among different groups.",
        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Intergroup Tolerance: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nThis project aims to advance our understanding of intergroup tolerance, a critical component of harmonious coexistence in increasingly diverse societies. Despite its importance, systematic empirical research on intergroup tolerance is scarce, making this project both groundbreaking and timely. Our objective is to investigate the social psychology of intergroup tolerance, addressing the pressing question of how to live harmoniously with others who are different from us.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we will employ a multi-method approach, combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. Our research will focus on four key components: the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the psychological processes that drive it, the limits of tolerance, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. By exploring these components, we expect to provide novel insights into the dynamics of intergroup tolerance, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its potential to inform strategies for promoting intergroup tolerance, fostering greater understanding and cooperation in culturally diverse societies. By shedding light on the complexities of intergroup tolerance, we hope to make a meaningful impact on social cohesion, conflict resolution, and community building."
