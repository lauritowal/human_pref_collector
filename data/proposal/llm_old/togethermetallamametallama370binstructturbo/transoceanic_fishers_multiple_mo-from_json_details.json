        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\nThis project, Transoceanic Fishers, challenges the assumption that fishers are mere instruments of state agendas, instead, it presents a nuanced understanding of fishers as mobile maritime actors navigating complex transoceanic networks. Focusing on the South China Sea, our research examines the shift in fishing practices, transoceanic expansion, and fisher movements across China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. We employ a novel theoretical and methodological framework, combining radical marine harvesting techniques, thalassographic analysis, and fine-grained ethnography to study Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers.\n\nOur research recognizes fishers as diverse actors, including fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers, and explores their relational and shifting multiple mobilities. We identify shore-based key nodal points as crucial in understanding the transoceanic networks that drive the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. This project contributes significant scientific and policy value by providing a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of transoceanic fishers and their networks. Our findings will inform policies that address the environmental, economic, and social implications of transoceanic fishing practices, ultimately promoting sustainable and equitable management of marine resources.",
        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\nThis project, TransOcean, challenges the assumption that fishers are mere instruments of state agendas by examining the complex, transoceanic movements of fishers in and out of the South China Sea. Focusing on the shift in fishing practices, transoceanic expansion, and fisher movements, our research will uncover the relational and shifting multiple mobilities of fishers across China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. We will employ a novel theoretical and methodological framework, combining fine-grained ethnography with thalassographic analysis to understand the radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and diverse categories of fishers (fisher, poacher, trader, smuggler).\n\nThrough a comparative study of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, we will identify key nodal points, such as shore-based networks, and examine the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. Our research will provide significant scientific and policy value by revealing the intricate dynamics of transoceanic fishers and their impact on the South China Sea's ecosystem and governance. By moving beyond state-centric approaches, TransOcean will offer a more nuanced understanding of the complex, mobile, and often illicit activities of fishers, ultimately informing more effective and sustainable management of the region's marine resources.",

Focusing on the shift in fishing practices, transoceanic expansion, and fisher movements, this research will uncover the relational and shifting multiple mobilities of fishers operating between China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. By employing radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and thalassographic analysis, this study will provide a nuanced understanding of the fine-grained ethnography of fishers, categorized as fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers.\n\nTheoretical and methodological frameworks will be developed to examine the shore-based key nodal points of fisher movements, driven by growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. Through an in-depth study of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, this project will generate significant scientific and policy value. By exploring the complex transoceanic networks and mobilities of fishers, TransOcean will contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of marine resource exploitation and the development of more effective conservation and management strategies. Ultimately, this project will provide a novel framework for understanding the role of fishers as mobile maritime actors, shaping the future of marine governance and sustainability."
