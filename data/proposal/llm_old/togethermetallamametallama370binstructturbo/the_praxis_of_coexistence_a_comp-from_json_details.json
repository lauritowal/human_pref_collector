        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\n\nThis research program seeks to understand the complexities of ethno-religious coexistence in diverse communities across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. By adopting a novel, empirical, and inductive approach, we aim to uncover how coexistence is practiced in everyday life, beyond theoretical and normative frameworks. Our objectives are fourfold: to understand spontaneous coexistence practices, inform policy through empirical study, enlighten community expectations for coexistence, and explore the resources used to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. Through a comparative and inductive approach, we will focus on ordinary coexistence in contexts of religious and ethnic diversity. Our research questions drive the inquiry: How do communities accommodate difference spontaneously? What resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict? By addressing these questions, we aim to open theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence and take culture and existing practice into account for diversity dilemmas. Ultimately, our project seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of coexistence in practice, informing more effective policies and interventions that promote peaceful and inclusive societies.",
        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\n\nThis research program seeks to address the pressing issue of ethno-religious coexistence through a novel empirical, inductive, and comparative approach. Focusing on how coexistence is practiced in diverse communities across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel, our project aims to understand the spontaneous practices that enable ordinary coexistence amidst religious and ethnic diversity. Our objectives are fourfold: to uncover the ways in which communities accommodate difference, to inform better policy through empirical study, to illuminate community expectations for coexistence, and to explore the resources used to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict.\n\nThrough a comparative and inductive approach, we will explore the praxis of coexistence in diverse contexts, seeking to open up theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence. By taking culture and existing practice into account, we aim to develop a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities of diversity. Our research questions drive the project: How do communities accommodate difference spontaneously? What resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict? By answering these questions, our project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, community leaders, and scholars seeking to promote more harmonious and inclusive societies. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of coexistence, informing more effective strategies for managing diversity and promoting social cohesion.",

The objectives of this project are fourfold: to understand coexistence practices, inform better policy through empirical study, enlighten about community expectations for coexistence, and explore the resources used to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict.\n\nThrough a comparative and inductive approach, this project will explore two key research questions: How do communities accommodate difference spontaneously, and what resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict? By taking culture and existing practice into account, this project aims to open up theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence, ultimately informing more effective policies and practices that support diversity. The project's focus on ordinary coexistence and religious and ethnic diversity will provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities of coexistence, ultimately contributing to a more peaceful and harmonious society."
