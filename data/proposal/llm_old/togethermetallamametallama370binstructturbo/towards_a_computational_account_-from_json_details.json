        "Here is a 265-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Towards a Computational Account of Natural Sequential Behavior\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive computational framework to understand and model natural sequential behavior in everyday tasks. Our goal is to elucidate the intricate relationships between perception, cognition, and action in the face of uncertainty and variability. We aim to achieve this by integrating insights from psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. Our approach will involve a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling, focusing on tasks such as classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making. By analyzing human behavior in these tasks, we expect to recover subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits (including effort), and action variability. Building on our previous experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical work on individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial modeling, this project will provide a fundamental understanding of how humans make sequential decisions under uncertainty. The proposed framework will have far-reaching implications for fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and cognitive science, enabling the development of more realistic and human-like sequential decision-making systems.",

Our goal is to identify and characterize the underlying mechanisms of perception, cognition, and action in the face of perceptual uncertainty and action variability. We will investigate how individuals make optimal decisions under uncertainty, balancing internal and external costs and benefits.\n\nTo achieve this, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. We will design a series of behavioral experiments, including classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making, to collect rich datasets on human behavior.\n\nOur expected outcomes include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits (including effort), and action variability. Building on our previous work on visuomotor behavior and individual-by-individual, trial-by-trial modeling, we will develop a computational account of sequential behavior that can predict and explain human performance in real-world tasks. This framework will have significant implications for understanding human behavior, improving decision-making, and developing more effective human-machine interfaces. Ultimately, our work will contribute to the development of artificial intelligence systems that can interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way."
