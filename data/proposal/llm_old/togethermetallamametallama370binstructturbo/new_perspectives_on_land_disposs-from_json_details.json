        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\n\nThis project investigates the complex relationships between land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel, with a focus on Mali. We hypothesize that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, and that violent resistance is linked to the rise of \"jihadist\" groups. Through a mixed-methods approach, we will examine the link between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration, and assess why some smallholders resist violently while others remain compliant. Our research is grounded in political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies.\n\nFarmers and pastoralists are the target groups for this study, as they are often disproportionately affected by land dispossession and violent conflict. The project's objectives are to provide novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, and to generate new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration. Our research aims to inform policy formulation and contribute to more effective and sustainable solutions to the pressing issues of land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel. By exploring the complex dynamics between land, power, and violence, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the root causes of migration and violent conflict, and shed light on the ways in which smallholders navigate and respond to these challenges.",

Our research will explore the ways in which elite capture of land and resources contributes to violent resistance and migration, and identify potential policy solutions to mitigate these outcomes.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics driving land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel, as well as ideas for policy formulation to address these issues. By shedding light on the root causes of violent conflict and migration in the region, this project aims to inform more effective and sustainable responses to these pressing development challenges.",
