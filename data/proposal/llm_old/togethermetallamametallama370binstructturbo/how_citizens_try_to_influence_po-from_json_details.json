        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: How Citizens Try to Influence Politics and Why: International Comparisons of Movement and Party Politics\n\nThis project seeks to advance our understanding of political participation and its underlying drivers in democratic societies. By comparing contentious and non-contentious politics across eight countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina, we aim to uncover the reasons behind individuals' political engagement or apathy. Our research objectives are threefold: to understand individuals' political engagement or apathy, to investigate the causes of different modes of political participation, and to explore the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal dynamics.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a mixed-methods approach, comprising four subprojects. A meta-analysis of existing literature on movement and party politics will provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Comparative analysis of global survey data will identify patterns and trends of political participation over time and across countries. Focus group discussions in each of the eight countries will offer insight into the formation of political engagement and disengagement. Finally, experimental focused surveys among 1000 respondents in each country will quantify patterns of political participation.\n\nBy integrating these different approaches, we will be able to identify the factors that drive citizens to engage in different forms of political participation, and how these factors vary across countries and contexts. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of political participation, ultimately informing strategies to promote active citizenship and strengthen democratic societies.",

        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: How Citizens Try to Influence Politics and Why: International Comparisons of Movement and Party Politics\n\nThis project seeks to understand how citizens engage with politics and why they choose certain modes of participation over others. By comparing contentious and non-contentious politics across eight countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina, we aim to uncover the individual, organizational, and societal dynamics driving political engagement and apathy. Our interdisciplinary approach combines meta-analysis, global survey data comparisons, focus group discussions, and experimental focused surveys to provide a comprehensive understanding of political participation in democratic societies.\n\nThe project consists of four subprojects. A meta-analysis of existing literature on movement and party politics will provide a foundation for understanding the current state of research. Comparative analysis of global survey data will identify trends and patterns of political participation over time and across countries. Focus group discussions in each of the eight countries will shed light on how citizens form their political engagement and disengagement. Finally, experimental surveys among 1000 respondents in each country will quantify patterns of political participation and test hypotheses generated by the previous subprojects.\n\nBy investigating the causes of different modes of political participation and the interplay between individual, organizational, and societal factors, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping political engagement in democratic societies. The findings will inform policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to promote active citizenship and strengthen democratic institutions."
