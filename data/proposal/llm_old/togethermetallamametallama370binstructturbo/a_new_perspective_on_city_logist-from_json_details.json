        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\nThis proposal seeks to revolutionize city logistics by developing a novel framework that prioritizes public value in planning and management. Our objective is to create a measurement system that integrates multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization to ensure that logistics operations maximize public value. We will achieve this through three interconnected objectives. Firstly, we will develop a public value measurement system, incorporating cutting-edge methods to assess the social, economic, and environmental impacts of logistics operations. Secondly, we will design principles, models, and tools for Logistics-as-a-Service (LaaS) infrastructure, utilizing network optimization to create efficient and sustainable systems. Finally, we will develop a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization to enhance flexibility and adaptability.\n\nOur expected outcomes include a new theory of city logistics, significant efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential to transform the transport and logistics sector, and have significant social, economic, and environmental consequences. By prioritizing public value, our research aims to create a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient city logistics system, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban citizens.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach to city logistics, focusing on the development of a public value measurement system and the design of Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure and operating procedures. Our objectives are threefold: (1) to establish public value as a key metric for city logistics planning and management, incorporating multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization; (2) to develop principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design using network optimization; and (3) to create a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization. We anticipate that this project will yield a new theory of city logistics, leading to efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure and the maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research will be far-reaching, with scientific and practical impacts on transport and logistics, as well as social, economic, and environmental consequences. By rethinking city logistics through the lens of public value, we can create more sustainable, efficient, and equitable urban systems.",
