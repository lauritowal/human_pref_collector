        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: OsciLang: A Neurofeedback System for Diagnosis and Intervention in Language and Reading Impairments\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to develop OsciLang, a wearable brain-computer-interface neurofeedback system for the detection and treatment of language disorders, specifically dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). OsciLang aims to provide an affordable, lightweight, and user-friendly system that synchronizes the brain's activity with changes in speech signals to diagnose and rehabilitate language impairments.\n\nBuilding on research showing reduced auditory tracking in the delta band in dyslexic readers, OsciLang will utilize neurofeedback based on phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech. This innovative approach is expected to improve literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia by enhancing brain-speech tracking capabilities, even in noisy environments. The system will feature a real-time EEG interface that quantifies basic parameters of brain activity, allowing users to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns.\n\nOsciLang will monitor phase coherence at theta and delta bands, providing valuable insights into language processing. The proposed system has the potential to provide a framework and technology for enhancing reading abilities beyond language impairments. By supporting the development of OsciLang, this grant will contribute to the creation of a novel, non-invasive, and accessible tool for diagnosing and treating language disorders, ultimately improving the lives of individuals with dyslexia and SLI.",

This technology has the potential to improve literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia, particularly in noisy environments where language processing is most challenging.\n\nUltimately, OsciLang aims to provide an accessible, user-friendly tool for clinicians, educators, and individuals to diagnose and intervene in language impairments, promoting more effective reading instruction and improved literacy outcomes. This project has the potential to significantly impact the lives of individuals with language impairments, enhancing their ability to read and communicate effectively.",
