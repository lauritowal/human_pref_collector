        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: In Praise of Community: Shared Creativity in Arts and Politics in Italy (1959-1979)\n\nThis project, \"In Praise of Community,\" explores the intersection of performing arts and politics in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. Focusing on the concept of \"commonality practices,\" we will study, collect, and contextualize artist collaborations that emerged during this period of significant social and cultural change. By applying the \"will-to-the-common\" concept to counterculture art, we will highlight the significance of artistic communities both locally and internationally. Our innovative approach will employ new modeling of performing arts knowledge and interpretation, as well as cutting-edge digital archive visualization. The project's outcomes will include a comprehensive approach to collecting, digitalizing, restoring, and disseminating Italian performing arts heritage, ultimately preserving this valuable cultural legacy. By examining the historical, philosophical, artistic, and sociological debates of the time, we will create a rich digital archive of Italian artists' performances, shedding new light on the role of community in shaping artistic expression.",

Focusing on the concept of \"commonality practices,\" we will study, collect, and contextualize artist collaborations that emerged during this period of social and cultural transformation. By applying the \"will-to-the-common\" concept to counterculture art, we will highlight the significance of artistic communities both locally and internationally. The project's objectives are to create a comprehensive digital archive of Italian artists' performances, develop new models for interpreting performing arts knowledge, and visualize the archive in innovative ways.\n\nDrawing on historical, philosophical, artistic, and sociological debates, as well as Social Network Theory, our methodology will provide a nuanced understanding of the relationships between artists, their practices, and the social and political contexts in which they worked. The project's outcomes will include a comprehensive approach to collecting, digitalizing, restoring, and disseminating Italian performing arts heritage, as well as the preservation of this cultural legacy. INCOMMON will be the first study to systematically analyze the field of performing arts as resulting from the practice of commonality, providing a novel perspective on the role of community in shaping artistic expression and cultural identity.",

Focusing on the concept of \"commonality practices,\" we will study, collect, and contextualize artist collaborations that exemplify the \"will-to-the-common\" principle, a core tenet of counterculture art. Our research will highlight the significance of artistic communities locally and internationally, while creating a comprehensive digital archive of Italian artists' performances.\n\nBy bridging historical, philosophical, artistic, and sociological debates, our project will develop new models for understanding performing arts knowledge and interpretation. Innovative digital archive visualization will enable the preservation and dissemination of Italy's performing arts heritage. Our methodology will involve a comprehensive approach to collection, digitalization, restoration, and dissemination of archival materials.\n\nThe project's outcomes will include a systematic analysis of the performing arts as a result of commonality practices, shedding new light on the role of artistic communities in shaping Italy's cultural and political landscape. The digital archive will provide a valuable resource for scholars, artists, and the general public, ensuring the long-term preservation of Italy's rich performing arts heritage. By exploring the intersections of art, politics, and community, \"In Praise of Community\" will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between creative expression, social change, and collective identity."
