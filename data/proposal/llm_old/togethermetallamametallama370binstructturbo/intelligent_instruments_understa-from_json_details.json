        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\n\nThis interdisciplinary project explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in musical creativity, examining its impact on our understanding of art, culture, society, and human relationships. By developing instruments infused with creative AI, we will investigate human-AI collaboration in music and utilize sonic instruments as scientific instruments to better comprehend the role of AI in embodied technologies. Our objectives are twofold: to initiate a public discourse on creative AI and develop a theoretical framework for reevaluating notions of self, others, and knowledge.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary research collaboration protocol, our team will bring together diverse scientific disciplines to tackle this complex issue. Our approach will foster a deeper understanding of the implications of creative AI on society, reflecting its potential impact on future societal structures. The project's outcomes will provide valuable insights into the role of creative AI in shaping our understanding of technology and its relationships with humans.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator with a background in music, philosophy, and computer science and AI, this project will not only develop a theoretical framework for creative AI but also initiate a public discourse on human-centered AI. Furthermore, it will define principles of ethical AI design in services and products, ultimately contributing to a more informed and responsible integration of AI in our daily lives. By using music as a platform, we will establish a public understanding of AI, sparking a conversation about the implications of creative AI on our collective future.",
