        "Here is a 255-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a novel approach to analyzing household consumption behavior using revealed preferences. Our project aims to open the \"intrahousehold black box\" by integrating marriage market dynamics into structural modeling, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of household decision-making processes. We will employ a nonparametric, non-unitary modeling approach to accommodate unobserved heterogeneity across households and avoid parametric assumptions on decision processes. By combining revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems, we will provide a more accurate description of intrahousehold decision processes and analyze household consumption patterns. Our approach will utilize pooled cross-section data sets to overcome the limitations of traditional revealed preference methods. The main contributions of this project will be twofold: (1) theoretical integration of marriage market dynamics into structural modeling, and (2) empirical integration of revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems. By addressing the challenges of unobserved heterogeneity and limited power of revealed preference restrictions, our project will provide a more comprehensive understanding of household consumption behavior, ultimately informing policy decisions that affect household well-being.",

Our goal is to open the \"black box\" of intrahousehold decision-making by integrating marriage market dynamics into structural modeling and nonparametric estimation of demand systems. We aim to avoid parametric assumptions on decision processes and provide a detailed description of the intrahousehold decision process.

By integrating revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation, we will provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding of household consumption behavior. Our methodology will contribute to the development of a new empirical toolkit for analyzing household consumption, enabling researchers to better understand the complex dynamics of intrahousehold decision-making. The proposed project has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of household behavior, informing policy decisions and improving the design of social programs.",
        "Here is a 255-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\n\nThis project aims to develop a novel approach to analyzing household consumption behavior using revealed preferences. Our proposed methodology integrates non-unitary modeling of households with empirical analysis of household consumption, leveraging nonparametric estimation of demand systems. By incorporating marriage market dynamics into structural modeling, we will open the intrahousehold \"black box\" and provide a more nuanced understanding of decision-making processes within households.\n\nThe objectives of this project are threefold. First, we will use aggregate consumption information to reveal intrahousehold decision processes, avoiding parametric assumptions on decision-making. Second, we will describe the intrahousehold decision process in detail. Finally, we will analyze household consumption patterns using pooled cross-section data sets.\n\nOur approach addresses two significant challenges in the field: unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions. By developing a nonparametric toolkit for empirical analysis, we will provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of household consumption behavior. The expected outcomes of this project will have important implications for policy design and evaluation, particularly in areas such as taxation, social welfare, and consumer protection. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of household decision-making processes, informing more effective policy interventions."
