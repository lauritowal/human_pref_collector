        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nThe proposed project, Blockchain4Biodiversity, aims to develop and test ReSeed, a blockchain-based digital farmers' market that promotes the conservation and sustainable use of indigenous seeds (ISK) and associated know-how. The current system lacks transparency and incentives for small farmers to conserve and share their ISK, hindering global food security and sustainable agriculture. ReSeed addresses these gaps by providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable platform for tracking the flow of ISK, ensuring equitable and traceable transfers, and incentivizing honest reporting of downstream research.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods research approach, we will engage with suppliers and buyers of ISK, as well as small farmers' communities, to integrate ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments. Our governance model will be guided by ethics guidelines, ensuring that the platform benefits small farmers and promotes agrobiodiversity conservation. Building on 12 years of previous research, ReSeed will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers' ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can create a sustainable and equitable system that rewards small farmers for their contributions to global food security, while preserving the rich biodiversity of indigenous seeds.",

The current lack of tracking and incentivization for ISK cultivation and conservation hinders global food security and sustainable agriculture. ReSeed addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable system for tracking the flow of ISK, ensuring equitable and traceable transfers, and incentivizing honest reporting of downstream research.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, we will engage with suppliers and buyers of ISK, integrating ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks with minimal required legal amendments. Our governance model will ensure ethics guidelines are in place to protect small farmers' communities, who will be the primary beneficiaries of this project. With 12 years of previous research experience, our team is well-positioned to deliver this project.\n\nThe expected benefits of ReSeed include in situ conservation, research and innovation with agrobiodiversity, value addition to farmers' ISK, and economic and environmental benefits to small farmers. By promoting the use and conservation of ISK, we can contribute to global food security and sustainable agriculture, while also supporting the livelihoods of small farmers. We believe that ReSeed has the potential to make a significant impact in the agrobiodiversity sector and look forward to collaborating with stakeholders to bring this project to fruition.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nThe proposed project, Blockchain4Biodiversity, aims to develop and test ReSeed, a decentralized platform utilizing blockchain technology to promote the conservation and sustainable use of indigenous seeds (ISK) and associated know-how. The project addresses the critical issue of dwindling economic incentives for ISK cultivation and conservation, which threatens global food security and sustainable agriculture. Current systems lack tracking mechanisms for ISK end use, and intellectual property laws do not protect ISK, hindering their value addition and equitable sharing.\n\nReSeed will provide a transparent, immutable, and decentralized platform for tracking the flow of ISK, ensuring equitable and traceable transfers, and incentivizing honest reporting of downstream research. The platform will integrate with international regulatory frameworks, requiring minimal legal amendments, and operate under an ethics-guided governance model.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods research approach, we will engage suppliers and buyers of ISK, ensuring the platform meets the needs of small farmers' communities. The project builds upon 12 years of previous research and will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, while bringing economic and environmental benefits to small farmers. By acknowledging and adding value to farmers' ISK, ReSeed will contribute to global food security and sustainable agriculture, ultimately benefiting local communities and the environment."
