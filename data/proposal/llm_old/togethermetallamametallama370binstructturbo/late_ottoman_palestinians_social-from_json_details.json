        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\n\nThis project explores the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine, a crucial yet understudied region in the Eastern Mediterranean, during a period of intense imperialist and globalizing pressures (1880-1920). By examining how Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class divides coped with the challenges of empire, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of global social and cultural history. Through a thorough analysis of census data and a comparative approach that spans the region and beyond, this project will investigate the social strategies employed by individuals and communities to navigate the complexities of Ottoman state building, European imperialism, and human mobility. Our hypothesis posits that the accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. The project's methodology will establish methodological standards for the study of colonialism under the British Mandate and develop a theoretical framework for understanding social differentiation and human mobility in the context of empire. Ultimately, this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine and contribute to the development of a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire.",
        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\n\nThis project explores the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine, situated at the crossroads of European imperialism, Ottoman state building, and globalization. Between 1880 and 1920, Palestinians from diverse ethnic, religious, and class backgrounds employed various strategies to cope with the challenges of empire. This research aims to uncover the social practices and formations that emerged in response to these challenges, and how they contributed to the constant reconfiguration of social structures.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis of census data and other sources, this project will investigate how individuals and groups navigated the complexities of imperial rule, state building, and global connectivity. It will develop a theoretical framework to explain the emergence and re-emergence of social formations, and establish methodological standards for the study of social and cultural dynamics in the Ottoman Empire. The project will also contribute to global social and cultural history, and provide new insights into the colonial experience under the British Mandate.\n\nBy creating a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire, this project will visualize and analyze the spatial dimensions of social change, and provide a new platform for research and collaboration. Ultimately, this project seeks to illuminate the complex and dynamic social landscape of late Ottoman Palestine, and its significance for our understanding of the modern Middle East.",
        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\n\nThis project explores the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine, a critical yet understudied region, during the period of 1880-1920. Situated at the intersection of European imperialism, Ottoman state building, and globalisation, this research investigates how Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class divides coped with the challenges of their time. By examining the practices of census-taking and other daily strategies, this study seeks to answer the question: Which social strategies did late Ottoman Palestinians employ to confront challenges on the individual and collective levels?\n\nOur hypothesis posits that the accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a comparative approach, utilising census data and other sources to analyse social practices across the region and beyond. This project aims to contribute to global social and cultural history, develop a theoretical framework, establish methodological standards, and create a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, it will provide insights into the colonial experience under the British Mandate. By shedding light on the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestine, this study will offer a nuanced understanding of the complexities of empire, globalisation, and social change in the Eastern Mediterranean."
