        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a novel, unifying conceptual and neural framework for understanding how reward influences human cognition. Reward is a fundamental motivator of human behavior, yet its impact on cognitive operations, such as conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation, remains poorly understood. This project aims to extend our conceptual understanding of reward effects by integrating factors like stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. To achieve this, we will employ optimized neuroimaging methods to investigate neural activity in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, which play critical roles in reward processing.\n\nThis research has significant implications for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. By elucidating the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind, we can inform strategies for improving cognitive function and well-being. Moreover, this work will shed light on disturbances in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems that contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease. Ultimately, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of the complex interplay between motivation, cognition, and neural function, with far-reaching implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",

By elucidating the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals, we can inform strategies for improving cognitive function and well-being. Furthermore, our work will explore disturbances in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease. A comprehensive understanding of reward's influence on cognition will ultimately inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for these disorders. By integrating multiple levels of analysis, from cognitive processes to neural systems, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of reward's role in shaping human cognition.",

Our project aims to extend current conceptual understanding of reward effects by integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. We will employ optimized neuroimaging methods to investigate neural activity in the dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems, which are critical for reward processing.\n\nThis research has significant implications for basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. By exploring the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind, we can inform strategies for improving motivation and cognitive performance. Furthermore, our findings will shed light on disturbances in DA and NA systems underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease.
