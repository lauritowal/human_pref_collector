        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Olfaction as the Link between Flavor Preference Formation and Retrieval during Food Consumption (OLFLINK)\n\nThe OLFLINK project aims to transform our understanding of how flavor preferences are formed and retrieved during food consumption, with the ultimate goal of promoting global health and sustainability through dietary changes. A major obstacle to achieving this goal is the persistence of preferences for familiar, often unhealthy, food flavors. OLFLINK tackles this challenge by investigating the critical role of olfaction in odor-taste associative learning, a process that is not yet fully understood. Specifically, the project seeks to uncover the cortical processes underlying the transfer of appetitive properties from odor to taste.\n\nThe OLFLINK project will address three key objectives: (1) determining the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (CODE), (2) delineating the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations (CONTROL), and (3) determining interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (REGULATE). By integrating these objectives across three nested levels of investigation, OLFLINK will provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological basis of flavor preference formation and retrieval.\n\nThe impact of OLFLINK will be significant, enabling the development of novel interventions to adjust learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and shedding light on the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. Ultimately, OLFLINK will contribute to a paradigm shift in our approach to promoting healthy and sustainable diets across the life course.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption (OLFLINK)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe OLFLINK project aims to uncover the neural processes that link olfactory perception to flavor preference formation and retrieval, a crucial step towards promoting global health and sustainability through dietary changes. Overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors is a significant challenge, and understanding the cortical processes of appetitive property transfer from odor to taste is a critical knowledge gap. This project will investigate the acquisition and regulation of new flavor preferences at three nested levels: the neural code for odor-taste associations (CODE), the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval (CONTROL), and the interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system (REGULATE). By elucidating these processes, OLFLINK will enable the development of novel interventions for dietary changes across the life course. The expected impact of this project includes the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, a deeper understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and the creation of effective strategies for promoting healthy and sustainable food choices. By integrating multiple levels of investigation, OLFLINK will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between olfaction, flavor preference, and dietary behavior, ultimately contributing to a significant shift towards healthier and more sustainable diets.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption (OLFLINK)\n\nThe OLFLINK project aims to revolutionize our understanding of how flavor preferences are formed and retrieved during food consumption, ultimately enabling a shift towards healthier and more sustainable diets globally. A critical barrier to achieving this goal is overcoming our preferences for familiar food flavors. OLFLINK tackles this challenge by investigating the odor-taste associative learning process, a crucial yet poorly understood mechanism underlying flavor preference formation.\n\nThis project addresses a significant knowledge gap in the cortical processes involved in the transfer of appetitive properties from odors to tastes.
