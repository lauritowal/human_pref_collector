        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Legal Status of Religious Minorities in the Euro-Mediterranean World (5th-16th centuries)\n\nThis project aims to collect, publish, and study legal texts that defined the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe, spanning the 5th to 16th centuries. Focusing on the Euro-Mediterranean region, we will examine the legal frameworks governing Christian, Muslim, and other religious minority groups. Our sources will include Roman law, Canon law, national or royal law, urban law, Rabbinical responsa, and Fatwa collections, with a specific focus on key texts such as the Theodosius code, Justinian code, and Siete Partidas.\n\nThe project's outputs will include a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, workshops, an international conference, comparative thematic studies, and a sourcebook of selected legal texts. A monograph on the legal status of minorities will also be published. By bringing together scholars from various disciplines, we will encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. Our target audience includes scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations.\n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to create a major reference tool for research in the history of minority law and interreligious relations. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the legal status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe, we will shed new light on the complex dynamics of interfaith relations and the evolution of legal frameworks governing minority groups.",
