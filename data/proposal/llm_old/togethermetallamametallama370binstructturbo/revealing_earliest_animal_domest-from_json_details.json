        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\nThis project aims to unravel the enigmatic origins of animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent, a crucial region for understanding the Neolithic transition. Focusing on early evidences of sheep and goat management, we will employ biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth to investigate the mechanisms underlying animal domestication. Specifically, we will examine how humans controlled animals' reproductive cycles, altered their feeding habits, and interrupted their migratory-seasonal movements.\n\nOur research will target faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers across three key regions: the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent. By integrating these approaches, we seek to challenge existing paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates and identify how human societies transformed animals through domestication.\n\nOur project goals are threefold: (1) to discover early caprine management practices, (2) to establish when and where animal domestication processes began, and (3) to understand how human societies changed animals through domestication. By achieving these goals, our project will provide a groundbreaking understanding of the earliest animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent, shedding light on the complex relationships between humans and animals that have shaped our world. This knowledge will have significant implications for our understanding of the Neolithic transition, the development of complex societies, and the conservation of biodiversity.",
        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\nThis project seeks to uncover the earliest evidence of animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent, a critical region for understanding the rise of Neolithic societies. Focusing on the initial management of sheep and goats, we will employ biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth to investigate the mechanisms underlying the transition from wild to domesticated animals. Specifically, we will examine the control of reproductive cycles, changes to feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements in these early domesticates. Our research will target faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers across three key regions: the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent. By integrating these approaches, we aim to unravel prevailing paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identify how human societies altered the biology and behavior of animals, and discover early caprine management practices. Ultimately, this project will establish when and where animal domestication processes began, providing fundamental insights into the evolution of human-animal relationships and the development of Neolithic societies. Our findings will have significant implications for understanding the rise of complex societies, the origins of food production, and the long-term consequences of human-animal interactions.",

Focusing on the management of sheep and goats, we will employ biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth to investigate the mechanisms underlying animal domestication, including control of reproductive cycles, changes to feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. Our research will target faunal assemblages from archaeological sites, as well as wild relatives in museum collections and current living populations in breeding centers, across three key regions: the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to challenge and refine current paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identifying how human societies altered animal populations and discovering early caprine management practices. By doing so, we will establish when and where animal domestication processes began, providing new insights into the development of Neolithic societies. Our findings will have significant implications for understanding the complex relationships between humans and animals, shedding light on the origins of agriculture and the rise of complex societies. This project will contribute to a deeper appreciation of the Fertile Crescent's role in shaping human history and will provide a foundation for future research on animal domestication and its impact on human societies."
