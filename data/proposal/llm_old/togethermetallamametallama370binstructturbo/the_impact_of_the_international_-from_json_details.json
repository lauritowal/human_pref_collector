        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the influence of the international right to housing on national legal discourse through the lens of eviction litigation. Focusing on Europe between 2007-2011, a period marked by a significant spike in evictions, we will utilize data science techniques to analyze a large dataset of eviction cases from national supreme courts and lower-level courts. Our objectives are threefold: to identify predictors of court decisions, conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of international law on national legal discourse, and conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights. \n\nBy employing citation network analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships in the legal data that can inform our understanding of how international law interacts with national legal systems. The project's potential outcomes are twofold: first, we expect to identify key predictors of court decisions, which can inform future litigation strategies; second, our research will demonstrate the applicability of data-driven methods to the study of law, paving the way for future projects in other areas of the law. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the international right to housing and its potential to shape national legal discourse, with implications for the lives of the approximately 700,000 people affected by evictions in Europe during the study period.",

Focusing on Europe between 2007-2011, a period marked by a significant surge in evictions affecting approximately 700,000 people, this study will employ data science techniques to analyze the intersection of national and international law. By leveraging \"legal big data\" resulting from the financial crisis, we will apply citation network analysis and machine learning to identify patterns and predictors of court decisions in national supreme courts and lower-level courts.\n\nThe objectives of this project are threefold: (1) to identify predictors of court decisions in eviction cases, (2) to conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse, and (3) to conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights. By achieving these objectives, this study has the potential to yield significant outcomes, including the identification of key predictors of court decisions and the development of a framework for understanding the complex interplay between national and international law.\n\nThe results of this project will have far-reaching implications for future research in various areas of the law, informing the development of more effective legal frameworks and policies that protect the rights of vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of international law in shaping national legal discourse and promoting social justice.",

The 2007-2011 financial crisis led to an unprecedented 700,000 evictions in Europe, prompting a surge in litigation. By leveraging data science techniques, we will analyze a unique dataset of legal big data resulting from this period to explore how national courts interact with international law in eviction cases.\n\nOur research objectives are threefold. First, we will identify predictors of court decisions in eviction cases. Second, we will conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse. Finally, we will conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights, shedding light on its intersections with other human rights.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a data-driven approach, combining citation network analysis and machine learning techniques. Our data sources will include national supreme courts and lower-level courts. This project's potential outcomes are twofold. First, we will uncover predictors of court decisions in eviction cases, informing future litigation strategies. Second, our research will have broader applications in other areas of law, demonstrating the value of data science techniques in understanding the interplay between national and international law.\n\nBy exploring the intersection of human rights and national legal discourse, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the right to housing and its implications for legal systems worldwide. Our findings will have significant implications for policymakers, legal practitioners, and scholars, ultimately informing more effective strategies to protect the right to housing in the face of future crises."
