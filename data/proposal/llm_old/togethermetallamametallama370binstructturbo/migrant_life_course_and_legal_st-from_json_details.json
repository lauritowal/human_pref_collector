        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\n\nThis project explores the complex relationship between migrants' legal status transitions, particularly the acquisition of citizenship, and their integration outcomes. By leveraging longitudinal and survey-based micro-data from 8 European and North American countries, we will investigate how policy variations influence legal status transitions and subsequent integration outcomes. Our objectives are fourfold: (1) to model migrants' legal status transitions as life course events, (2) to analyze the impact of citizenship on various dimensions of integration, including work, income, living conditions, health, out-migration, and education, (3) to develop innovative methodologies for analyzing step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact, and (4) to inform targeted citizenship policies that maximize settlement success. Our research will focus on immigrants and their children, with a particular emphasis on understanding the timing and impact of citizenship on their life trajectories. By examining the interplay between legal status transitions and integration outcomes, this project aims to provide evidence-based insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to promote the successful integration of migrant populations. Ultimately, our research will contribute to the development of more effective and inclusive citizenship policies that support the long-term settlement and well-being of migrant communities.",
        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\n\nThis project investigates the critical role of citizenship in shaping the integration outcomes of migrants and their children. By modeling legal status transitions as life course events, we will examine how policy variations influence migrants' trajectories towards citizenship and subsequent integration outcomes. Our research objectives are fourfold: (1) to develop a life course framework for analyzing legal status transitions, (2) to investigate the impact of citizenship on various integration outcomes, including work, living conditions, health, out-migration, and education, (3) to create methodologies for analyzing step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact, and (4) to test our models using longitudinal and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries. Our study targets both immigrants and their children, utilizing a unique combination of longitudinal register-based micro-data and survey-based micro-data. By informing targeted citizenship policies, our research aims to maximize settlement success and promote the social and economic integration of migrants. The project's innovative approach and comparative design will provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to improve migrant integration outcomes. Ultimately, our research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between legal status transitions and integration outcomes, informing evidence-based policies that support the successful settlement of migrants and their families.",
        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\n\nThis project investigates the complex relationships between migrants' legal status transitions, citizenship, and integration outcomes, with a focus on how policy variations influence these processes. Our research aims to model migrants' legal status transitions as life course events, analyzing the impact of citizenship on key integration outcomes, including work and income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment. We will develop innovative methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact, utilizing longitudinal and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries. Our study targets both immigrants and their children, providing a comprehensive understanding of the intergenerational implications of citizenship policies. By leveraging longitudinal register-based micro-data and survey-based micro-data, we will identify the most effective policy approaches to maximize settlement success. The project's findings will inform targeted citizenship policies, ultimately enhancing the integration of migrants and their descendants into host societies. Our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between legal status, citizenship, and integration, providing evidence-based solutions to promote the social and economic inclusion of migrant populations."
