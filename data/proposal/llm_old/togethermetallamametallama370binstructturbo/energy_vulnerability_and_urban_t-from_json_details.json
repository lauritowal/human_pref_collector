        "Here is a 268-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\n\nThe proposed project, \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe,\" aims to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in post-socialist cities. Millions of households in Eastern and Central Europe are affected by energy vulnerability, which is exacerbated by factors such as energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, income differentials, economic restructuring, and political restructuring. Current conceptualizations of energy poverty are limited by a focus on incomes and energy efficiency, overlooking the complex interplay of social and spatial factors.\n\nThis project will employ a comparative study framework, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, to examine energy vulnerability in four case study locations: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. By adopting an energy vulnerability framework, we will move beyond narrow economic and technical perspectives to uncover the root causes of energy poverty.\n\nThe project's potential outcomes are far-reaching, with the potential to improve technical and institutional frameworks, provide affordable energy services, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Ultimately, this research will transform our understanding of energy poverty, informing more effective policies and interventions to address this pressing issue. By shedding light on the social and spatial dimensions of energy vulnerability, we can work towards a more equitable and sustainable energy future for millions of households in Europe.",

Current conceptualizations of energy poverty are limited by a focus on incomes and energy efficiency, overlooking the complex interplay of factors contributing to energy vulnerability, including energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, income differentials, economic restructuring, and political restructuring. This project will employ a comparative study framework, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, to explore the multiple dimensions of energy poverty in four case study locations: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje.\n\nBy adopting an energy vulnerability framework, this project aims to transform our understanding of energy poverty and its impacts on urban populations. The study's potential outcomes include the improvement of technical and institutional frameworks, the provision of affordable energy services, and climate change mitigation. The project's findings will inform policymakers and practitioners, enabling them to develop more effective strategies to address energy poverty and promote sustainable urban transitions in post-socialist cities. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationships between energy, poverty, and urban development, and will provide actionable insights for reducing energy vulnerability and promoting more equitable and sustainable urban futures.",
