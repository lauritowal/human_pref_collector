        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\nThis project aims to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy by examining early Franciscan thought. Challenging the prevailing view that early Franciscans merely codified past work, this study will highlight their innovative contributions to the development of Western philosophy. Employing a novel \"practice-led\" hermeneutic approach, which considers the impact of practice on theory, this project will produce the first comprehensive analysis of early Franciscan thought, exploring its sources, methods, content, and later medieval reception. The study will identify novelty in early Franciscan work, including the use of Islamic sources, and draw connections between early and late Franciscan schools. Ultimately, this project will provide a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought, showcasing a shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity. By re-contextualizing Franciscan ideas within their original practice-led context, this project will advance knowledge and re-envision the state of the art in the study of scholasticism.",
        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy by exploring the innovative contributions of early Franciscan thought. Challenging the prevailing assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past work, this study will uncover the originality and novelty of their ideas, including their engagement with Islamic sources. By implementing a \"practice-led\" hermeneutic, which considers the influence of practice on theory, this project will produce the first comprehensive analysis of early Franciscan thought, examining its sources, methods, content, and later medieval reception.\n\nThe project's objectives include identifying the innovative aspects of early Franciscan work, tracing the connections between early and late Franciscan schools, and highlighting the shared philosophical identity between Muslim and Western traditions. The expected outcome is a nuanced and authoritative account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought. By recontextualizing Franciscan ideas within their original practice-led framework, this project will advance our understanding of scholasticism and its role in shaping modern Western philosophy. Ultimately, this study will demonstrate how Franciscan ideas became modernized when removed from their original context, providing a fresh perspective on the evolution of Western philosophical thought.",
