        "Here is a 303-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires (GoviB)\n\nThis project, Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires (GoviB), seeks to investigate the dynamics of governance in ancient Babylon during the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC, a period marked by the successive rule of the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian Empires. Focusing on local negotiations of imperial rule and the strategies employed by rulers to maintain stability or instigate instability, this study aims to deepen our understanding of politics and authority in Babylon during this transformative period. Despite the challenges posed by incomplete historical data and ambivalent or conflicting interpretations, GoviB will leverage a unique combination of textual materials from Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological findings from German excavations in Babylon, and resources from the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin.\n\nBy applying a governance studies conceptual framework, this project will evaluate the empires' roles in cultural transformation and reassess modern perceptions of \"oriental governance\" and \"regime stability.\" The expected outcomes of GoviB include a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between imperial powers and local populations, as well as a critical reevaluation of the legacies of these ancient empires. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a richer understanding of the evolution of governance and its continued relevance to contemporary debates on authority, power, and cultural exchange.",

Through a governance studies conceptual framework, this research aims to illuminate the complex dynamics of local negotiation and imperial rule, examining how rulers' strategies responded to instability or stability. Despite the significance of this period, existing historical data is incomplete, and interpretations are often ambivalent or conflicting. To address these challenges, GoviB will utilize a range of resources, including Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological materials from German excavations in Babylon, and collections from the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin.\n\nThe project's primary goals are threefold: to deepen our understanding of politics and authority in Babylon, to evaluate the role of empires in cultural transformation, and to inform modern perceptions of oriental governance and regime stability. By exploring the intricacies of governance in ancient Babylon, this research will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of imperial power, the agency of local actors, and the evolution of governance structures. Ultimately, GoviB seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between empires, local populations, and governance, shedding new light on the dynamics of power and authority in the ancient Near East.",

To overcome these challenges, GoviB will employ a governance studies conceptual framework, combining the analysis of Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological material from German excavations in Babylon, and resources from the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin.\n\nThe project's key focus lies in exploring how local populations negotiated imperial rule and how rulers responded to promote stability or instability. By doing so, GoviB will provide new insights into the strategies employed by rulers to maintain power and the ways in which local populations resisted or collaborated with imperial authorities. Ultimately, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of oriental governance and regime stability, offering valuable lessons for modern perceptions of governance and authority."
