        "Here is a 301-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the way historical data is created, curated, and analyzed by developing a novel framework for linking events and entities in medieval history. Focusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095) and the eastern half of Christendom, with additional attention to newly Christianized kingdoms in central Europe, this project aims to reveal trans-regional trends obscured by regional narratives.\n\nOur approach acknowledges the complexity of pre-modern history, where few facts are undisputed, by reframing historical data as assertions linked to an authority. This framework enables the manipulation of data according to source and authority, and the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict. By doing so, we can contextualize and reuse existing online data, preventing waste and promoting a more nuanced understanding of the past.\n\nInterdisciplinary in nature, this project draws on prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology to achieve its goal of viewing history from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework. By developing and testing new methods for creating and curating digital historical data, we can provide historians with innovative tools to re-evaluate the eleventh century and beyond. Ultimately, this project will demonstrate the power of linked data to reshape our understanding of the past and inform new historical narratives.",
        "Here is a 301-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the way historians create, curate, and interact with digital data about historical phenomena. By reframing historical data as assertions linked to an authority, our methodology enables the manipulation of data according to source and authority, and facilitates the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict. This approach acknowledges the complexity of pre-modern history, where few facts are undisputed, and provides a framework for tracing the authority behind each assertion.\n\nFocusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095), our project will examine the trans-regional trends that have been obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom. We will concentrate on the eastern half of Christendom, with additional attention to the newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe. By integrating insights from prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, we will develop a nuanced understanding of this pivotal period.\n\nA key challenge in digital humanities is the contextualization and reuse of existing online data to prevent waste. Our project addresses this challenge by creating a framework that enables the linking and manipulation of data from diverse sources. The ultimate goal is to provide a platform for historians to view history from multiple perspectives, using a traceable authority framework. By doing so, we will facilitate a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the past, and provide a model for the creation and curation of digital historical data that can be applied to other periods and regions.",
