        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\nCooperation is essential for the functioning of modern economies and societies, yet cooperation problems persist in various markets and social settings. This project proposes an economic engineering approach, advocated by Alvin Roth, to address these challenges. Our goal is to design and test innovative solutions that promote cooperation in modern markets and societies.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected work packages. The first package focuses on electronic reputation mechanisms, aiming to promote cooperation in the digital world by addressing the flaws of current trust mechanisms on the Internet. The second package explores mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, reducing collective wastefulness and threats to market liquidity and stability. The third package investigates market designs aligned with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights, to overcome distaste for certain kinds of transactions.\n\nBy employing experimental methods and behavioral game theory, this project expects to yield three key outcomes: improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. The project's results will have significant implications for policymakers, market designers, and scholars, providing new insights into the economic engineering of cooperation in modern markets and societies. Ultimately, this project aims to create a more cooperative and efficient economy, benefiting individuals and society as a whole.",
        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\nCooperation is essential for the well-being of both economy and society, yet modern markets and societies face significant cooperation problems. This project proposes an economic engineering approach, advocated by Alvin Roth, to address these challenges. Our goal is to develop innovative solutions to promote cooperation in modern markets and societies, thereby improving their functioning and advancing the field of cooperation sciences.\n\nOur methodology combines experimental methods and behavioral game theory to tackle three critical issues. First, we will design electronic reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in the digital world, where current trust mechanisms are flawed. Second, we will develop mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, which can lead to collective wastefulness and threaten market liquidity and stability. Third, we will create market designs aligned with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights, to overcome distaste for certain kinds of transactions.\n\nOur expected outcomes include improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. By addressing cooperation problems in modern markets and societies, this project has the potential to generate significant economic and social impact. Our interdisciplinary approach will bring together experts from economics, computer science, and psychology to develop practical solutions that can be applied in various contexts.",
