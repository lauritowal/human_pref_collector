        "Here is a 306-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)\n\nThis project proposes a groundbreaking investigation into the transmission of written artefacts in medieval Europe, focusing on the evolution of chivalric literature in Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages. LostMa aims to understand how human cultures evolve through the transmission of texts, determining the role of chance in preservation or loss, and analyzing the copying, transformation, and destruction of manuscript texts. By examining the role of humans in cultural transmission, we will investigate the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a novel interdisciplinary approach, combining artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise. We will analyze the copying and transformation of manuscript texts, using stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations to model the transmission of texts. Deep learning techniques will be used for large-scale data collection, focusing on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts from a corpus of 4000 medieval documents.\n\nBy treating the transmission of texts as a process akin to biological evolution or language variation, LostMa will provide new insights into the dynamics of cultural evolution, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the preservation and loss of written artefacts. The project's outcomes will have significant implications for our understanding of cultural heritage, the development of literary canons, and the role of chance and human agency in shaping our cultural legacy.",
        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)\n\nThis project, LostMa, aims to revolutionize our understanding of how human cultures evolve through the transmission of written artefacts. By analyzing the copying, transformation, and destruction of medieval manuscripts, we will uncover the role of chance and human agency in shaping cultural heritage. Focusing on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to model the transmission of texts. Our methods will include stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection. Through this project, we will investigate the survival of texts, the formation of cultural canons, and the dynamics of cultural evolution. With a corpus of 4000 manuscripts in Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, LostMa will provide new insights into the evolution of chivalric literature in a European context. By examining the transmission of texts as a process akin to biological evolution, we will shed light on the intricate mechanisms that have shaped our cultural legacy.",
        "Here is a 306-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, LostMa, seeks to understand the dynamics of cultural transmission through the lens of medieval manuscript texts. By combining artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise, we will investigate how written artefacts were copied, transformed, or destroyed, and how humans contributed to their preservation or loss. Our case study focuses on chivalric literature in the European context, encompassing Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages.\n\nWe will analyze the transmission of texts as a process akin to the evolution of organisms or language variants, involving innovation/mutation, fixation, or extinction. Our approach will employ stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection. We will examine approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, part of a larger corpus of 4000 documents.\n\nLostMa's objectives are to: (1) understand how human cultures evolve through the transmission of written artefacts, (2) determine the role of chance in the preservation or loss of texts, (3) analyze the copying and transformation of manuscript texts, (4) understand the role of humans in cultural transmission, and (5) investigate the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons.\n\nBy modelling the transmission of medieval texts, LostMa will provide new insights into the evolution of human culture, the role of chance and human agency, and the dynamics of cultural heritage. Our findings will have significant implications for the humanities, social sciences, and computational sciences, and will inform the development of new methods for understanding and preserving cultural artefacts."
