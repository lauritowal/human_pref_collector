        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Next-Generation Building Information Modeling to Support Evaluation of Human Behavior in Built Environments\n\nThe built environment has a profound impact on human life, yet current Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools fail to adequately consider the complex interplay between buildings, users, and context. Existing tools are limited by their focus on physical and material characteristics, neglecting the intended use and user experience. This oversight hinders the ability to predict how buildings will affect users' lives and activities, leading to inadequate assessments of whether buildings meet their intended purposes.\n\nThis proposal seeks to address these limitations by developing a comprehensive building modeling method that incorporates form, function, and use information. By integrating user behavior and context into BIM systems, we can better design buildings that support the needs and activities of their occupants. This research aims to revolutionize the field of building design, enabling the creation of buildings that not only meet physical requirements but also foster well-being, productivity, and sustainability.\n\nThe proposed research is timely, as the built environment is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in shaping human life on Earth. By advancing BIM capabilities, we can improve building design, enhance our ability to predict user behavior and interaction, and ultimately create built environments that promote the health, happiness, and prosperity of their occupants. This project has the potential to transform the built environment, leading to better-designed buildings that support the well-being of individuals and communities.",
        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\n\nCurrent Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools are limited in their ability to represent buildings holistically, focusing solely on physical and material characteristics while neglecting context, intended use, and user considerations. These limitations hinder the evaluation of buildings beyond physical aspects like lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, making it impossible to predict a building's impact on future users' lives and activities. As a result, buildings often fail to meet their intended users' needs.\n\nThis proposal aims to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that incorporates form, function, and use information into BIM systems, enabling the evaluation of buildings in the context of human behavior and interaction. By doing so, this research seeks to improve building design, enhancing the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment.\n\nThe built environment has a profound impact on life on Earth, and the development of advanced BIM systems that account for user behavior and context is crucial for creating better-designed buildings that meet users' needs. This research has the potential to revolutionize the building design process, leading to enhanced user experiences, improved building performance, and ultimately, a better quality of life. By supporting this project, we can take a crucial step towards creating built environments that truly support and enhance human life.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\n\nCurrent building information modeling (BIM) tools are limited in their ability to effectively evaluate the impact of built environments on human behavior. These limitations include inadequate representation of buildings, a focus solely on physical and material characteristics, and a lack of consideration for context, intended use, and user needs. As a result, buildings are often designed without fully understanding their potential effects on users' lives and activities. This proposal aims to address these limitations by developing a comprehensive building modeling method that incorporates form, function, and use information. The proposed research seeks to create advanced BIM systems that can predict user behavior and interaction in built environments, ultimately leading to better designed buildings that meet the needs of their intended users. This research is critically important, as the built environment has a recognized impact on life on Earth. By enhancing our ability to design buildings that support human well-being, we can create more sustainable, healthy, and livable communities."
