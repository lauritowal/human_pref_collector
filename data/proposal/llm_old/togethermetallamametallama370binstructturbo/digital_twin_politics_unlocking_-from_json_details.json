        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nThe European Commission's prototype digital twin of the ocean (DTO) presents a transformative opportunity for sustainable ocean management. However, the development and use of DTOs are fraught with challenges, including time pressure, persisting data gaps, and the need to implement global sustainability goals for ocean protection. Moreover, there are risks of perpetuating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and potential misuse. The TwinPolitics project addresses these challenges by examining the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes and the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting.\n\nOur approach re-conceptualizes digital twins as socio-technical relations, combining qualitative and quantitative research to study the practices, policies, and politics of DTOs in the EU, USA, and China. We will investigate how DTOs are used during multilateral negotiations, shedding light on the power dynamics and interests that shape their development and deployment. By doing so, TwinPolitics will break new ground in understanding the complexities of digital twins and their implications for sustainable ocean futures.\n\nThis project's innovative methodology and comparative approach will provide critical insights into the opportunities and risks associated with DTOs, informing policy and practice to ensure that these powerful technologies serve the global public interest. Ultimately, TwinPolitics aims to unlock the full potential of digital twins for sustainable ocean management, contributing to the achievement of global sustainability goals and a more equitable future for all.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nThe European Commission's prototype digital twin of the ocean (DTO) presents a groundbreaking opportunity to revolutionize ocean management and sustainability. However, the development and implementation of DTOs are not without challenges and risks. Against this backdrop, the TwinPolitics project seeks to examine the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes, as well as the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting.\n\nThis innovative project will re-conceptualize digital twins as socio-technical relations, combining qualitative and quantitative research to investigate the practices, policies, and politics presiding over digital twins in national and regional contexts. Focusing on the EU, USA, and China, TwinPolitics will explore the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations, shedding light on the complex dynamics at play.\n\nBy addressing the time pressure, persisting data gaps, and implementation of global sustainability goals for ocean protection, TwinPolitics aims to mitigate the risks of perpetuating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and potential abuse and misuse of DTOs. Our approach will break new ground in understanding the interplay between digital twins, politics, and sustainability, ultimately informing the development of effective and equitable DTOs that support a sustainable ocean future.\n\nThrough its interdisciplinary approach, TwinPolitics will provide critical insights for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders, ensuring that the potential of DTOs is harnessed to achieve sustainable ocean governance and protect the world's oceans for future generations.",

We will also study the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations, providing a nuanced understanding of the role of digital twins in shaping ocean governance.\n\nBy developing a novel methodological approach that integrates insights from science and technology studies, international relations, and sustainability governance, TwinPolitics will break new ground in understanding the complex dynamics of digital twins in ocean governance. Our project will provide critical insights for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders seeking to harness the potential of digital twins for sustainable ocean futures, while mitigating the risks associated with their development and use."
