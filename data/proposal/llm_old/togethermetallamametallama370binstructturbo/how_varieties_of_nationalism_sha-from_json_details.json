        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\n\nThis project examines the complex and multifaceted relationship between nationalism and political polarization in advanced democracies. While existing research often frames nationalism as a transnational cleavage based on cultural conflict, this study takes a novel approach by distinguishing between different varieties of nationalism and their impact on electoral politics. Through a multi-method comparative research design, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how national identities can both divide and unite citizens.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected work packages. First, novel survey data will be analyzed to study how public conceptions of nationalism shape partisan divisions using open-ended survey questions. Second, elite mobilization efforts based on different varieties of nationalism will be examined. Finally, the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility will be explored. This comprehensive approach will provide a rich understanding of the ways in which nationalism influences political polarization.\n\nThe expected contributions of this project are twofold. Firstly, it will advance academic research by providing new insights into the complex relationship between nationalism and political polarization. Secondly, it will enrich public debate on the societal challenges posed by nationalism, ultimately informing strategies to mitigate its divisive effects and harness its potential to bring people together. By shedding light on the varieties of nationalism and their implications for political polarization, this project will contribute to a more informed and nuanced understanding of this pressing issue.",

Second, we will investigate elite mobilization efforts centered on various forms of nationalism. Third, we will assess the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nThis project aims to contribute to academic research advancements in the fields of political science, sociology, and nationalism studies. By providing a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between nationalism, polarization, and partisan divisions, our research will enrich public debate on these pressing societal challenges. Ultimately, our findings will inform strategies for mitigating the polarizing effects of nationalism and cultivating national identities that promote social cohesion. We believe that this project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of the role of nationalism in shaping our polarized politics and will contribute to a more informed and inclusive public discourse."
