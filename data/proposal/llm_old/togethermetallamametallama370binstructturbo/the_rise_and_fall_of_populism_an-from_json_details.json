        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive, multi-part investigation into the complex relationships between personal experiences, information environments, and aggregate economic shocks that shape political decisions and behaviors. Through a mixed-methods approach, we will empirically test how these factors influence support for populist and extremist ideologies.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected parts. First, we will examine how personal employment histories and information environments influence voting behavior, using a unique database of over 40 million resumes and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, we will investigate the impact of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas, leveraging archival records on corporal punishment regulations in UK schools and contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting. Finally, we will analyze the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, utilizing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda during WWII Germany.\n\nBy exploring the heterogeneity of responses to economic shocks and the role of personal experiences in shaping political attitudes, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the rise and fall of populism and extremism. The proposed research has significant implications for policymakers, scholars, and the general public, offering insights into the complex dynamics underlying political polarization and extremism.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to empirically investigate the complex relationships between personal experiences, information environments, and aggregate economic shocks in shaping political decisions and extremist behaviors. The project consists of three interconnected parts, each addressing a distinct research question.\n\nFirst, we will examine how personal employment histories and information environments influence voting behavior, using a database of over 40 million resumes and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, we will explore the impact of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas, leveraging archival records on corporal punishment regulations in UK schools and contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting. Third, we will investigate the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, utilizing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda in WWII Germany.\n\nThrough these three parts, our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic, social, and psychological factors contributing to the rise and fall of populism and extremism. By shedding light on the heterogeneous responses to economic shocks, we hope to inform policy interventions that mitigate the appeal of extremist ideologies and promote more inclusive and resilient democratic societies.",

By integrating these distinct research threads, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the heterogeneity of responses to economic shocks and the role of personal experiences and information environments in shaping political attitudes and behavior. Ultimately, this project seeks to inform strategies for mitigating the appeal of populist and extremist ideologies and promoting more inclusive and resilient democratic societies."
