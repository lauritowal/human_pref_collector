        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD)\n\nThis project, situated at the intersection of International Relations and climate change policy, investigates the emergence and contestation of justice norms in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The urgent need to address climate change consequences has led to a lack of consensus on loss and damage policy, with significant implications for disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration. Through an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic approach, CCLAD will explore the micro-politics of international negotiations and domestic policy practices, comparing the latter across different countries.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, to examine the influence, contestation, or reversal of norms, and to develop a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. Building on the theory that norms are partly constituted through policy-making and implementation, CCLAD will make methodological contributions to political ethnography and develop practice-tracing methods. By shedding light on the dynamics of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage, this project will inform more effective and just policy responses to this critical global challenge.",
        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD)\n\nThe CCLAD project investigates the emergence and contestation of justice norms in the context of climate change loss and damage, a critical issue requiring urgent attention. Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the lack of consensus on loss and damage policy hinders effective responses to climate change consequences. This interdisciplinary project employs a theoretical and ethnographic methodology to examine the micro-politics of international negotiations and domestic policy practices, comparing approaches at the international and national levels.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, to analyze the influence, contestation, or reversal of norms, and to develop a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. Building on the theory that norms are partly constituted through policy-making and implementation, CCLAD will make significant methodological contributions to political ethnography and develop innovative practice-tracing methods.\n\nBy exploring the politics of climate change loss and damage, this project will provide crucial insights into the complex dynamics of norm emergence and contestation, shedding light on the urgent need to address climate change consequences. The research will inform policy areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration, ultimately contributing to more effective and just responses to climate change.",

Despite the urgent need to address the consequences of climate change, there is a lack of consensus on loss and damage policy, hindering effective international cooperation. This interdisciplinary project employs a theoretical and ethnographic approach to explore the conditions under which norms become hegemonic, how they are influenced, contested, or reversed, and the fluidity of norm-content over time.\n\nThe project will examine the micro-politics of international negotiations and conduct comparative research on domestic policy practices at the international and national levels. By developing practice-tracing methods, CCLAD will make a methodological contribution to political ethnography. The study's objectives are to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, analyze the influence, contestation, or reversal of norms, and provide a new understanding of norm-content fluidity.\n\nBy exploring the politics of climate change loss and damage, CCLAD will shed light on the complex relationships between norms, policy-making, and implementation.
