        "Here is a 294-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nThe BIGlobal project aims to investigate the sources of firm growth and market power, providing novel insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Building on the European Commission's 2007 report, this five-year research endeavor will incorporate richer firm behavior into models of international trade, focusing on developing economies. By integrating theoretical work with rich data, BIGlobal will address four critical research questions: How can trade and competition policy ensure consumer benefits from globalization when firms have market power? How do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect small farmers' gains from trade? How do industrial policies impact firm growth through input linkages? And, what is the effect of banking globalization on firm growth in the real sector?\n\nThrough this project, we expect to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, providing a basis for informed policymaking. By examining the interplay between firm growth, market power, and policy, BIGlobal will offer a more nuanced understanding of the global economy, ultimately informing strategies to promote economic development and welfare. The project's outcomes will be essential for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders seeking to navigate the complexities of globalization and promote inclusive economic growth.",
        "Here is a 294-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nThis five-year research project, BIGlobal, aims to investigate the sources of firm growth and market power to inform welfare and policy in a globalized world. Building on the European Commission's 2007 report, our research seeks to provide new insights into the impact of trade and industrial policies on firm growth, particularly in developing economies. We will incorporate richer firm behavior into models of international trade, examining how trade and competition policy can ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms have market power. Our research will also explore how domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect small farmers, how industrial policies influence firm growth through input linkages, and the impact of banking globalization on firm growth in the real sector.\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical work and rich data analysis, our project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between firm growth, market power, and policy. Our expected outcomes include expanding the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and providing a basis for informed policymaking. By shedding light on the sources of firm growth and market power, our research will inform strategies to promote economic development, improve consumer welfare, and enhance the competitiveness of firms in developing economies. Ultimately, BIGlobal will contribute to a deeper understanding of the global economy and its implications for policymakers, businesses, and consumers alike.",
        "Here is a 294-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nThis five-year research project, BIGlobal, aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power in the global economy, providing new insights into welfare and policy implications. Building on the European Commission's 2007 report, this study will incorporate richer firm behavior into models of international trade to examine how trade and industrial policies impact growth, particularly in less developed markets.\n\nThe project addresses four key research questions: (1) How can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms have market power? (2) How do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect small farmers' gains from trade? (3) How do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages? (4) What is the impact of banking globalization on firm growth in the real sector?\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical work and rich data analysis, this project will focus on developing economies and provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between firm growth, market power, and policy interventions. The expected outcomes of this research are twofold: (1) to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and (2) to provide a basis for informed policymaking.\n\nBy examining the sources of firm growth and market power, BIGlobal will inform policymakers on how to design effective policies that promote economic growth, welfare, and development in a globalized world."
