        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the development of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in the first millennium of the Common Era, with a focus on the Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India. Recent discoveries at the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand have underscored the significance of this region and time period for understanding the transmission of Buddhist texts. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, this project will explore the textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of these manuscripts.\n\nThe project's output will include a digital archive of Gilgit/Bamiyan manuscripts, an akṣara database, and digital preservation of the manuscripts. Additionally, the project will produce editions and translations of select manuscripts, as well as feature studies of textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. A multi-language content comparison will also be conducted to shed light on the relationships between manuscripts from different regions. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the development of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in Greater Gandhāra, this project will contribute significantly to the fields of Buddhist studies, manuscript research, and digital humanities.",

Recent discoveries at the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand have brought to light a wealth of new textual material in Indic languages, providing an unprecedented opportunity to explore the production, transmission, and relationships of these manuscripts.\n\nUsing a multidisciplinary approach combining philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, this project will examine the textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of these manuscripts. The project's outputs will include a digital archive of the manuscripts, an akṣara database, and digital preservation of the manuscripts. Additionally, the project will produce editions and translations of the manuscripts, as well as feature studies of their textual, paleographical, and codicological characteristics. A comparative analysis of the content across multiple languages will also be conducted.\n\nBy shedding light on the development of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in Greater Gandhāra, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the history of Buddhism and the cultural heritage of the region. The project's digital outputs will ensure the long-term preservation of these valuable manuscripts and make them accessible to scholars and the public worldwide.",
