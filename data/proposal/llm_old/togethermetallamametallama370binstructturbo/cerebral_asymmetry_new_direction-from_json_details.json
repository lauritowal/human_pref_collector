        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\nThis interdisciplinary project marks the 150th anniversary of Broca's pioneering work on language and the brain by exploring the neural basis of functional cerebral asymmetry. Our central hypothesis, the network efficiency hypothesis, posits that the organization of language functions across the two hemispheres influences language development and impairment. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a multi-pronged investigation comprising five interconnected projects.\n\nProject A will identify individual differences in language lateralization patterns using behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Project B will examine the risk of language and literacy impairment in individuals with atypical language lateralization patterns. Project C will employ genetic simulations to investigate the heritability of language lateralization using twin-cotwin similarity data. Project D will apply a double hit genetic model to study neurodevelopmental abnormalities in individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin, a gene linked to language processing. Finally, Project E will search for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with inconsistent language laterality patterns.\n\nBy integrating genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging approaches, this project aims to provide new insights into the etiology of language impairment and the neural mechanisms underlying functional cerebral asymmetry. The proposed research has the potential to inform the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for language-related disorders.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\nThis proposal marks 150 years since Paul Broca's groundbreaking discovery of language lateralization in the brain. Our interdisciplinary project aims to explore functional cerebral asymmetry, focusing on impaired language development and combining genetic and neuropsychological approaches. The network efficiency hypothesis guides our investigation, which comprises five interconnected projects. Project A will identify individual differences in language function lateralization using behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Project B predicts that individuals with different language functions represented in opposite hemispheres are at increased risk for language and literacy impairment. Project C will simulate genetic models to investigate twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization. Project D will test the double hit genetic model, examining neurodevelopmental abnormalities in individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin due to an extra sex chromosome. Finally, Project E will search for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with inconsistent patterns of language laterality. By integrating these approaches, we will provide new insights into the correlates and etiology of cerebral asymmetry, shedding light on the complex relationships between brain organization, language development, and genetic factors. Our findings will have significant implications for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of language and literacy disorders.",

Our key hypothesis, the network efficiency hypothesis, posits that individual differences in language lateralization patterns affect language development and literacy. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a five-project framework. Project A will identify individual differences in language function lateralization using behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Project B will test the prediction that opposite-hemisphere representation of language functions increases the risk of language and literacy impairment. Project C will employ genetic model simulations to analyze twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization. Project D will apply the double hit genetic model to individuals with an extra sex chromosome, predicting that neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise from multiple hits on a functional brain circuit. Finally, Project E will focus on individuals with inconsistent language laterality patterns, searching for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with departure from consistent left hemisphere language. By integrating genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging approaches, this project will provide novel insights into the correlates and etiology of language development and literacy impairment, ultimately informing strategies for early identification and intervention."
