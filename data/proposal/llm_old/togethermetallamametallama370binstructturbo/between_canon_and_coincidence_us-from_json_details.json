        "Here is a 241-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Between Canon and Coincidence: Using Data-Driven Approaches to Understand Art Worlds (BECACO)\n\nThis project, BECACO, seeks to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections by examining the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural materials. Building on Howard Becker's concept of \"Art World Patterns\" (2008[1982]), our research will employ quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining to uncover new insights into the provenance of Indigenous Latin American material. We will analyze a large corpus of provenance data from 12 museums across 9 countries in Europe, focusing on the period between 1850 and 2000. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we aim to develop new models for provenance research and advance conceptual and methodological understandings in the field. Our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe, shedding light on the complex historical dynamics that have shaped cultural collections. Ultimately, BECACO will provide a nuanced understanding of the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections, informing museum practices and cultural heritage policies.",
        "Here is a 241-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Between Canon and Coincidence: using data-driven approaches to understand Art Worlds (BECACO)\n\nThis project, BECACO, seeks to revolutionize the study of provenance by reconceptualizing it as a large-scale examination of socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural materials. Building on Howard Becker's concept of \"Art World Patterns\" (2008[1982]), we will employ quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining to investigate the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections. Our corpus consists of a vast dataset of provenance records from 12 museums across 9 countries in Europe, covering the period from 1850 to 2000. By focusing on Indigenous Latin American material, we aim to develop new models for provenance research and advance conceptual and methodological frameworks. The project's outcome will significantly impact our understanding of the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe, providing a nuanced perspective on the cultural and historical contexts of these collections. Ultimately, BECACO will contribute to a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of the complex dynamics shaping the art world.",
