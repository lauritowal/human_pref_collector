        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\n\nThis project aims to revolutionize our understanding of international trade by incorporating firm-level heterogeneity into conventional trade models. In the context of rising protectionist pressures and nationalistic tendencies in Europe, this research is crucial for informing evidence-based trade policies that promote economic welfare. The project addresses three fundamental questions: What determines patterns of international trade and associated welfare effects? Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? Should governments intervene to promote or restrict international transactions? \n\nThrough four interconnected work packages, this project will investigate the aggregate implications of firm-level heterogeneity on market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies, comparative advantages, and exporter capabilities. By examining the interactions between country, sector, and firm characteristics, this research will provide novel insights into the design of cooperative trade agreements, the response to trade liberalization, and the distribution of productivity among producers. The project's ultimate goal is to highlight key dimensions along which traditional trade models should be revisited, thereby informing policymakers on how to maximize joint welfare in international trade. By providing a more nuanced understanding of the aggregate implications of firm-level heterogeneity, this project will contribute to more effective trade policies that promote economic integration and welfare in Europe.",
        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\n\nIn the face of resurgent nationalistic tendencies and protectionist pressures in Europe, this project seeks to revisit conventional trade models in light of firm-level heterogeneity. The research aims to highlight key dimensions along which individual firm characteristics impact aggregate economic performance, trade policy design, and comparative advantages of countries. The project is structured around four work packages. The first package investigates the allocative inefficiency due to firm heterogeneity and pricing distortions, and its impact on a country's aggregate economic performance. The second package develops a theoretical framework for designing optimal multilateral trade policies that maximize joint welfare of all trade partners. The third package studies the interaction between country, sector, and firm characteristics in response to trade liberalization, and its implications for comparative advantages. The fourth package examines the role of firm heterogeneity in determining a country's export capabilities and its impact on the productivity distribution of producers. By exploring these research questions, this project will provide new insights into the determinants of international trade patterns and associated welfare effects, and offer guidance on whether governments should intervene to promote or restrict international transactions. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the aggregate implications of firm-level heterogeneity in international trade, informing policy debates on the design of optimal trade agreements and the role of government intervention.",

By revisiting conventional trade models through the lens of firm heterogeneity, this project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between firms, trade policies, and economic outcomes. The ultimate goal is to inform evidence-based trade policies that promote economic integration and welfare enhancement in the face of growing disenchantment with globalization."
