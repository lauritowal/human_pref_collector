        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\n\nThis project, \"Global Economies of Salvation\" (GLOBECOSAL), investigates the critical role of artworks in negotiating sanctity with the Roman Curia during the post-Tridentine era of Iberian hegemony. By examining the production of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, this research seeks to uncover how local constructions of sanctity were shaped by global networks of knowledge transmission and the circulation of material objects. Challenging traditional perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world, this project will globalize the history of early modern art and shed new light on the complex interplay between art, power, and spirituality.\n\nThrough a critical sociological lens, this research will explore how artworks were used for self-representation and social identity formation, revealing the ways in which Catholic communities negotiated spiritual status and affirmed their place in society. By focusing on neglected areas such as local constructions of sanctity and the role of blesseds and saints in Iberian empires, this project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the global market of symbolic values that shaped the early modern period. The proposed methodology, which combines iconographic analysis with the tracing of material objects and global networks of knowledge transmission, will provide a rich and multifaceted understanding of the complex dynamics at play. Ultimately, this project aims to challenge prevailing narratives and offer a more inclusive and global understanding of the early modern world.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\n\nThis project, \"GLOBECOSAL,\" explores the critical role of artworks in negotiating sanctity within the Roman Catholic Church during the post-Tridentine period, an era marked by Iberian hegemony and Catholic-Protestant conflict. By examining the production and circulation of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, we will uncover how local constructions of sanctity were shaped and contested in a global context. Our research challenges prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world, offering a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between art, power, and spirituality.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, combining art history, critical sociology, and global network analysis, we will trace the circulation of material objects, iconographies, and knowledge transmission networks to reveal how artworks were used for self-representation and social identity formation. Our hypothesis is that these artworks expose the negotiation of spiritual status within Catholic communities, ultimately affirming the society's ability to produce saints.\n\nBy globalizing the history of early modern art and challenging dominant narratives, this project will provide new insights into the complex dynamics of sanctity, power, and art in the early modern period. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural, social, and religious tensions that shaped the modern world, with significant implications for art history, sociology, and religious studies.",

By analyzing artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, this research reveals how spiritual status was constructed and contested in early modern Catholic communities. Challenging prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world, this project globalizes the history of early modern art, highlighting the complex interplay between local constructions of sanctity and the Roman Curia's Tridentine models.\n\nThrough a critical sociological framework, this project employs innovative methodologies, including tracing the circulation of material objects, analyzing iconographies, and mapping global networks of knowledge transmission. By exploring how artworks functioned for self-representation and social identity formation, this research demonstrates how the creation and dissemination of artworks reflected the negotiation of spiritual status and the affirmation of societies producing saints. This project seeks to transform our understanding of the early modern period, revealing the complex dynamics of sanctity, power, and artistic production in a global context."
