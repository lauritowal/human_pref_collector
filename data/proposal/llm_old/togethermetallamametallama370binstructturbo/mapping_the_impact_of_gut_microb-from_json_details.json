        "Title: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project aims to elucidate the impact of gut microbiota on brain and behaviour, with a specific focus on the neurotransmitter GABA. Despite the significant genetic similarity between humans (99% identical), individual differences in gut bacteria composition can have a profound impact (1% difference). The gut microbiome is composed of distinct bacteria (40-90% different from human cells), with a 1:1 bacteria-to-human cell ratio and a 10:1 bacteria-to-human DNA ratio. While the influence of gut-produced neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin on brain and behaviour remains a significant knowledge gap, our biochemically informed approach will investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.\n\nThe project consists of two work packages: (1) investigating the relationship between gut bacteria and brain GABA levels, and (2) testing the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour over four weeks using a custom-made probiotic. By integrating psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, this project seeks to understand how gut bacteria and probiotics influence brain GABA levels and function, ultimately shedding light on individual differences in human behaviour and brain function. Our research has the potential to inform novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.",
        "Here is a grant proposal abstract based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nThe intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain remains poorly understood, particularly in regards to the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters on brain function and behaviour. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the role of gut bacteria in modulating brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance. Building on the biochemical understanding of gut-brain interactions, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to explore the complex relationships between gut bacteria, brain GABA, and behaviour.\n\nOur research will involve two interconnected work packages. First, we will investigate how gut bacteria modulate brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance in human adults using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Second, we will test the impact of ingesting custom-made probiotics containing GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour over a four-week period. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying the gut-brain axis, this project aims to understand how individual differences in gut microbiota contribute to variations in human behaviour and brain function. Our findings will have significant implications for the development of novel probiotic-based interventions targeting brain GABA function and behaviour.",
        "Here is a 304-word abstract for a grant proposal based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nThis interdisciplinary research proposal aims to elucidate the hitherto underexplored relationship between the gut microbiome and brain function, with a specific focus on the neurotransmitter GABA. Despite the striking facts that humans share 99% of their genetic material, and that the gut microbiome outnumbers human cells 1:1 and DNA 10:1, the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters on brain and behaviour remains a significant knowledge gap. Our biochemically informed approach will investigate how gut bacteria influence brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance in human adults. We will employ Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure brain GABA levels and assess task performance. Furthermore, we will design a custom-made probiotic intervention to test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour over a four-week period. By integrating psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, this project seeks to understand the role of gut bacteria and probiotics in shaping individual differences in human behaviour and brain function. Our research will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders, where GABA dysregulation is implicated. Ultimately, this project will advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between the gut, brain, and behaviour, paving the way for innovative approaches to promote human health and well-being."
