        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to investigate the emergence of formalism in twentieth-century thought, with a focus on the philosophy of science and logic. The project's objective is to conduct a comprehensive and comparative study of the early contributions to formalism, spanning the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe project is divided into three subprojects. The first subproject, \"Historical Reconstruction,\" will explore the roots of formalism in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology, with a focus on key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The second subproject, \"Comparative Study,\" will examine the formal turn in logic and its relation to logical empiricism, highlighting the work of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The third subproject, \"Analysis of Philosophical Implications,\" will delve into the philosophical consequences of formalism, including semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nBy adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex historical and conceptual developments that shaped the emergence of formalism in the early twentieth century. The project's outcomes will contribute significantly to the philosophy of science and logic, shedding new light on the intellectual foundations of modern formalism and its ongoing impact on various fields of inquiry.",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the emergence of formalism in the early twentieth century, a pivotal moment in the development of modern logic, philosophy of science, and mathematics. The proposal's objective is to conduct a comparative and historical study of the key contributions to formalism during this period, focusing on the intersection of mathematics, logic, and philosophy.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected subprojects. The first subproject, \"Historical Reconstruction,\" explores the roots of formalism in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology, with a particular emphasis on the works of Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp (1860-1910). The second subproject, \"Comparative Study,\" examines the formal turn in logic and the rise of logical empiricism from 1920 to 1940, highlighting the contributions of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The third subproject, \"Analysis of Philosophical Implications,\" delves into the philosophical significance of formalism, investigating topics such as semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nBy elucidating the historical and conceptual development of formalism, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the intellectual foundations of modern logic, philosophy of science, and mathematics. The proposed research will shed new light on the complex relationships between these fields and their ongoing impact on contemporary philosophy and science.",

Focusing on the first half of the twentieth century, our research will explore the historical, philosophical, and logical underpinnings of formalism, tracing its roots in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected subprojects. The first subproject will undertake a historical reconstruction of the period between 1860 and 1910, examining the contributions of key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The second subproject will conduct a comparative study of the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940, focusing on the work of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The third subproject will analyze the philosophical implications of formalism, investigating topics such as semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nBy integrating historical, philosophical, and logical perspectives, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the formal turn and its far-reaching consequences for twentieth-century thought. The proposed research will not only shed new light on a pivotal moment in the history of philosophy and science but also inform contemporary debates in logic, philosophy of science, and mathematics."
