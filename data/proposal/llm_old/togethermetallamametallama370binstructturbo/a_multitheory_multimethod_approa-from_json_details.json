        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence\n\nThe proposed project addresses the pressing global issue of violent extremism, a priority of the United Nations Decade of Action (2020-2030). Despite efforts to combat radicalization, shortcomings in current research hinder effective prevention and intervention strategies. This project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a comprehensive, multi-theory model of radicalization and deradicalization, and an innovative methodology for data collection. The project's four work packages will: (1) develop a theoretical framework integrating multiple perspectives on radicalization; (2) design a novel methodology for data collection on radicalization and deradicalization; (3) conduct interviews and experiments in 10 countries to examine mechanisms of radicalization inside and outside prisons; and (4) develop evidence-based programs for preventing radicalization in prisons and promoting deradicalization. The project's international scope, involving 10 countries, will provide a unique opportunity to collect empirical data from diverse samples of violent extremist offenders worldwide. The expected outcomes of this project are twofold: (1) significant contributions to scientific understanding of radicalization and deradicalization, and (2) novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism. By addressing the theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings of current research, this project has the potential to inform and improve prevention and intervention strategies, ultimately reducing the risk of violent extremism.",

The project will be conducted in collaboration with partners from 10 countries: Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan. The project's expected contributions include collecting unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders worldwide, and providing novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism. By addressing the complexities of radicalization leading to violence, this project will inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to the prevention and reduction of violent extremism globally.",
        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence\n\nThe proposed project responds to the United Nations' Decade of Action (2020-2030) priority of fighting violent extremism by addressing the theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings in current research on radicalization and deradicalization. Our multi-theory, multi-method approach will develop a comprehensive understanding of the nature and mechanisms underlying radicalization and deradicalization, and inform evidence-based strategies for prevention and intervention.\n\nThe project consists of four work packages. We will first develop a multi-theory model of radicalization and deradicalization, and then design an innovative methodology for data collection. We will subsequently conduct a comparative study in 10 countries, including Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan, using interviews and experiments to examine mechanisms of radicalization inside and outside prisons. Finally, we will develop evidence-based programs for preventing radicalization in prisons and conducting deradicalization.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to the scientific understanding of radicalization and deradicalization by collecting unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders worldwide. Moreover, it will provide novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism, informing policy and practice in this critical area. By addressing the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of radicalization, our project aims to reduce the risk of violent extremism and promote global peace and security."
