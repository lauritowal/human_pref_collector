        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, based in Zarzis, Tunisia, seeks to understand the end of lives in the Mediterranean context by employing a novel approach: forensics as the art of paying attention. Through a decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa, we will map unliveable life conditions in Zarzis, focusing on five case studies: phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. By developing forensics as a method for ethnographic study, we will advance the concept of vital elements, examining the resources crucial for life and their interrelations in Zarzis.\n\nThe project's innovative approach will be facilitated through collaborations, including team site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists in the Vital Elements Atelier. By paying attention to the often-overlooked Mediterranean context, we will challenge dominant narratives and shed light on the complex relationships between human and non-human elements that sustain life in Zarzis. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersections between life, death, and the environment, while promoting a more nuanced and inclusive approach to ethnographic research.",
        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach to understanding the complex interplay of vital elements that sustain life in the Mediterranean context, with a focus on the harbour town of Zarzis, Tunisia. By employing forensics as the art of paying attention, we will map unliveable life conditions and examine the intricate relationships between resources crucial for life, including phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. Our approach marks a significant decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa, centering the experiences and perspectives of local communities.\n\nThrough a collaborative methodology involving team site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists in the Vital Elements Atelier, we will develop forensics as a innovative method for ethnographic study. This project advances the concept of vital elements, highlighting the interconnectedness of resources and their impact on human life. By doing so, we will provide a nuanced understanding of the end of lives in the Mediterranean context, shedding light on the often-overlooked experiences of communities in this region.\n\nThe proposed project's innovative aspects, including its decolonial approach, methodological advancements, and collaborative framework, position it to make a significant contribution to the field of ethnographic study and beyond. Ultimately, this project aims to promote a deeper understanding of the vital elements that sustain life and to inspire new forms of attention, care, and responsibility towards the Mediterranean region and its inhabitants.",
        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\nThis project proposes an innovative, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the end of lives in the Mediterranean context, focusing on the harbour town of Zarzis, Tunisia. By employing forensics as the art of paying attention, we will examine the complex interrelations between vital elements crucial for life, including phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. Our approach, rooted in decolonial theory, shifts attention from Europe to Africa, centering the experiences and perspectives of local communities.\n\nThrough a combination of team site visits, Method Lab work, and local artist partnerships in the Vital Elements Atelier, we will develop a nuanced understanding of the unliveable life conditions that exist in Zarzis. Our research will advance the concept of vital elements, highlighting the interconnectedness of natural resources and their impact on human life. By doing so, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the Mediterranean context, where the exploitation of natural resources often results in environmental degradation and human suffering.\n\nThis project's innovative aspects lie in its decolonial approach, the development of forensics as a method for ethnographic study, and the advancement of the vital elements concept. Our research will have significant implications for policy, practice, and theory, shedding light on the complex relationships between natural resources, environmental degradation, and human well-being in the Mediterranean region."
