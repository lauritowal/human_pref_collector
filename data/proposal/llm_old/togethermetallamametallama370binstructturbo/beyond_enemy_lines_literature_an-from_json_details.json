        "Here is a 129-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nThis project, \"Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949,\" offers a groundbreaking examination of the cultural landscape in post-war Germany. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining literature and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing, this study will investigate the cross-fertilization of Anglo-American and German literature and film during the Allied Occupation. By providing a new interpretative framework for post-war culture, this project will contribute to the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany and explore the relationship between post-war culture and the Cold War. Focusing on the British and American zones of occupied Germany, this research will open up a major new field of study, shedding light on the intertwining of post-war Anglophone and Germanophone literature and culture.",

        "Here is a 129-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nThis multidisciplinary project, \"Beyond Enemy Lines,\" offers the first comprehensive survey of the cultural landscape in the British and American zones of Occupied Germany from 1945 to 1949. By investigating the cross-fertilization of Anglo-American and German literature and film, this study will provide a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, contribute to the history of the Allied Occupation, and examine the intertwining of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature. Through a combination of literary and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing, this project will explore the relationship between postwar culture and the emerging Cold War. By opening up a major new field of research, \"Beyond Enemy Lines\" will significantly enhance our understanding of the complex cultural dynamics of Occupied Germany during a pivotal moment in modern history."
