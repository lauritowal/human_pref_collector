        "Here is a 311-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the world is grappling with the intertwined crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Against this backdrop, foraging practices have experienced a global resurgence, as people seek alternative means of subsistence and connection to their environments. Despite its growing relevance, foraging remains a poorly understood phenomenon, with patchy mainstream attention and a dearth of in-depth research.\n\nThis project, \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism,\" aims to develop a political ecology of foraging, situating this practice within the context of the Anthropocene. Our international team of five researchers, based at the Rachel Carson Center at LMU Munich, will conduct interdisciplinary research grounded in anthropology to explore the complexities of foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis of diverse foraging practices, including yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US, we will examine the ways in which foraging intersects with capitalist systems, environmental degradation, and social inequality.\n\nThe project's planned outputs include two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition. By shedding light on the dynamics of foraging in the context of late capitalism, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the ways in which humans interact with their environments, and inform strategies for more sustainable and equitable futures.",
        "Here is a 311-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the world has witnessed a significant increase in foraging practices globally, from yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal to woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia. Despite its growing relevance, foraging remains a patchily understood phenomenon, often overlooked in mainstream discourse. This project seeks to develop a political ecology of foraging, situating it at the nexus of the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and capitalist systems. \n\nSet against the backdrop of the Anthropocene, our research will explore foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy, highlighting its intersections with artisanal mining, nomadic practices, and informal economies. Based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, our international team of five researchers will employ an interdisciplinary approach, grounded in anthropology, to examine the complex relationships between foraging, environment, and economy.\n\nOver the course of the project, we aim to produce two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a documentary film, and a curated exhibition. By shedding light on the hidden dynamics of foraging, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of the ways in which humans interact with their environment, and to inform more sustainable and equitable economic practices. Ultimately, this project seeks to reposition foraging as a critical site of inquiry, one that can help us reimagine our relationship with the natural world and our place within it.",

By illuminating the political ecology of foraging, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between economy, environment, and society, ultimately informing more sustainable and equitable futures. This project has the potential to reshape our understanding of foraging and its place within the broader context of capitalist systems, environmental degradation, and human well-being."
