        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The mental economy: testing a dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling (HOMEOSTASIS)\n\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project challenges the dominant theory of working memory, which attributes limitations solely to the absence of information. Instead, we propose a novel framework, the \"internal mental economy,\" where the brain optimizes the trade-off between internal storage and external sampling of the visual world to maintain perceptual homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that observers minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature, prioritizing external sampling to reduce cognitive load. To test this model, we will employ innovative paradigms that engage participants with their physically present environment, leveraging electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology. \n\nIn addition to healthy participants, we will also study patients with restricted deficits to specific components of the model, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying working memory. Machine learning applications will be used to discover biometric signatures in eye movements, enabling the diagnosis of working memory disorders and a deeper understanding of human interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments. \n\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of working memory, moving beyond the current focus on maximum capacity to explore the dynamic interplay between internal and external resources. By developing a more comprehensive model of working memory, we can improve the diagnosis and treatment of working memory disorders, and inform the design of more effective human-computer interfaces.",
        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The mental economy: testing a dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling (HOMEOSTASIS project)\n\nThe dominant theory of working memory limitations focuses solely on the absence of information, neglecting the critical role of interaction with the visible world. The HOMEOSTASIS project challenges this view by proposing an internal mental economy model, where the goal is to maintain perceptual homeostasis by trading internal storage against external sampling. We hypothesize that observers minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature, instead relying on external sampling to conserve cognitive resources. \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we will employ novel paradigms that engage participants with physically present environments, utilizing electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology. Additionally, we will conduct a patient study with individuals having restricted deficits to specific components of the model, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying working memory. By applying machine learning techniques to eye movement data, we aim to discover biometric signatures that can diagnose working memory disorders. \n\nThe proposed model has significant implications for understanding human interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments. By recognizing the dynamic interplay between internal storage and external sampling, we can develop more effective interventions for working memory disorders and improve human-computer interaction design. The HOMEOSTASIS project offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding working memory, with far-reaching consequences for both theoretical and practical applications.",
        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Mental Economy: Testing a Dynamic Trade-off between Internal Storage and External Sampling (HOMEOSTASIS)\n\nThe dominant theory of working memory views it as a limited-capacity system, with limitations arising from the absence of information.
