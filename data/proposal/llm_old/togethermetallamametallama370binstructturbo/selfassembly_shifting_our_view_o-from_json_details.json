        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: AssemblingLife: Shifting our View of Life through Self-Assembly\n\nThe AssemblingLife project proposes a paradigm shift in our understanding of life, moving beyond the traditional view of biological systems as requiring constant energy input and detailed genetic regulation. By exploring the concept of self-assembly, we aim to develop a new theoretical framework that explains life processes as spontaneous formations of complex patterns and structures without external guidance. This interdisciplinary project draws on insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science to challenge traditional notions of genetic causation and scientific explanation. Specifically, we will develop a new understanding of genetic causation, where genes act as \"nudgers\" rather than determinants, and a novel theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes. The potential impacts of this project are far-reaching, with the potential to shift our view of life in science and philosophy, and provide conceptual tools to both philosophy of science and empirical life sciences. By rethinking the fundamental principles of life, AssemblingLife has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the natural world and our place within it.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\n\nThe AssemblingLife project aims to revolutionize our understanding of life by developing a new theoretical framework that prioritizes self-assembly processes. Challenging the traditional view of biology, which emphasizes energy input and genetic regulation, this project will explore the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structures in living systems. By integrating insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science, we will develop a novel understanding of genetic causation, where genes act as \"nudgers\" rather than directors. Furthermore, we will establish a new theory of scientific explanation tailored to self-assembly processes. The potential impacts of this project are far-reaching, with the potential to shift our fundamental understanding of life in both scientific and philosophical communities. By providing conceptual tools to philosophers of science and empirical life scientists, AssemblingLife will open up new avenues for research and inquiry, ultimately transforming our understanding of the very nature of life.",
