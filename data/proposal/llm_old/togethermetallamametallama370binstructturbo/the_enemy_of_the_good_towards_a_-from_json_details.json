        "Here is a 206-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress\n\nThis project proposes an innovative approach to understanding moral progress, moving beyond the limitations of traditional frameworks that prioritize parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin. Our alternative theory focuses on various forms of moral progress, moral attitudes that transcend evolutionary constraints, and \"smart institutions\" that bypass the limitations of human psychology. Building on the concept of the \"expanding circle\" of moral concern, we aim to develop a more inclusive and expansive moral theory that overcomes arbitrary boundaries based on class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. Our goal is to extend moral concern beyond these ethically arbitrary features, promoting a more universal and impartial moral framework. By challenging the status quo and pushing the boundaries of moral theory, this project seeks to make a significant contribution to the field of ethics and inform more effective strategies for promoting moral progress in practice.",
        "Here is a 206-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress\n\nThis project seeks to develop an alternative theory of moral progress that breaks free from the constraints of our inherited psychology. Current limitations, such as parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin, hinder our ability to extend moral concern beyond narrow circles. Building on the \"expanding circle\" account of moral progress, this research aims to overcome these limitations by exploring different forms of moral progress, moral attitudes that are not subject to evolutionary constraints, and the role of \"smart\" institutions in fostering moral development. Specifically, we will investigate how to transcend ethically arbitrary features such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership, which often serve as barriers to moral inclusion. By challenging these boundaries, our goal is to develop a more comprehensive theory of moral progress that can guide efforts to extend moral concern to all individuals, regardless of their social group or characteristic. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide a framework for achieving a more inclusive and just society.",
        "Here is a 206-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress\n\nThis project seeks to develop an innovative theory of moral progress that moves beyond the limitations of traditional approaches. Building on the \"expanding circle\" account of moral progress, we will explore alternative forms of moral advancement that are not constrained by evolutionary pressures. Our focus will be on cultivating moral attitudes that can overcome the parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin that currently hinder moral development. Specifically, we aim to design \"smart institutions\" that can bypass the limitations of our inherited psychology and promote moral concern beyond arbitrary features such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. By extending moral consideration to all individuals regardless of these features, we hope to make significant progress towards a more just and equitable society. This project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of moral progress and provide a framework for addressing some of the most pressing ethical challenges of our time."
