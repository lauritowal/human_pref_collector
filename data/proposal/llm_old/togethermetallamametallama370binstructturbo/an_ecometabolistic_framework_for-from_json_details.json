        "Here is a 245-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\n\nThe built environment is a significant contributor to the global crisis of material depletion, and the architecture profession is challenged to transition towards sustainable building practices. This interdisciplinary project proposes an innovative eco-metabolistic framework to overcome the current limitations of bio-based materials in architecture. The framework addresses the representation, conceptualization, operationalization, and fundamental value proposition of bio-based materials, as well as the material lifespan conception. Through a research-by-design approach, this project aims to develop carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions using novel materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. The project will leverage computational modelling networks, including predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing, to create participatory practices and socially conscious models of production. The design agency concept of continual construction beyond building completion will be explored, enabling democratic models of production and challenging traditional notions of design agency. This project has the potential to transform the architecture profession, promoting sustainable practices and contributing to a more environmentally conscious built environment. By developing a new paradigm for sustainable architecture, this project will have a significant impact on reducing material depletion and promoting a more circular economy.",
        "Here is a 245-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\n\nIn the face of the global crisis of material depletion, the architecture sector must transition towards sustainable building practices. This project proposes an eco-metabolistic framework to facilitate this transition, focusing on a bio-based material paradigm. The framework addresses the challenges of representing, conceptualizing, operationalizing, and valuing bio-based materials in architecture, as well as the fundamental value proposition of architecture itself.\n\nThrough a research-by-design approach, this interdisciplinary project will develop carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions. We will investigate the potential of innovative materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria, and integrate these with computational modelling networks for predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing.\n\nThe project's design agency concept, \"continual construction beyond building completion,\" challenges traditional notions of design agency and proposes new participatory practices that exploit the short lifespans of bio-based materials for sustainable architecture. The outcomes of this project will include socially conscious and democratic models of production, contributing to a more sustainable built environment.\n\nBy developing an eco-metabolistic framework, this project will provide a critical step towards a more sustainable future for architecture, supporting the transition towards bio-based materials and practices that prioritize environmental stewardship and social responsibility.",

The framework addresses the challenges of representing, conceptualizing, operationalizing, and valuing bio-based materials in architecture.

By rethinking the relationship between architecture, materials, and the environment, this project has the potential to transform the built environment and mitigate the global crisis of material depletion. Ultimately, our eco-metabolistic framework will provide a critical foundation for sustainable architecture and inspire a new generation of designers, architects, and builders to adopt environmentally conscious practices."
