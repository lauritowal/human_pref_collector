        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\nThis project, PRILA, seeks to investigate how mechanisms for securing rights, ensuring accountability, and achieving adherence to the rule of law are experienced in European prisons. The project aims to examine the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies, and to study the structures and processes that govern fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making in prisons. By doing so, PRILA will create the first comprehensive account of accountability work in European prisons, shedding light on the often-overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to create an account of accountability work experience, to examine accountability structures as manifestations of penal ideologies, and to advance conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness in prisons. PRILA's interdisciplinary approach, combining legal research, qualitative and quantitative methods, and insights from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and sociology of punishment, will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex power dynamics at play in prisons.\n\nThe project's expected impact is significant, with the potential to transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advance judicial review of administrative action, and enhance understanding of penal power experiences. By supporting better penal policies and practices, PRILA will contribute to protecting the rule of law and rights in prisons, ultimately ensuring fair treatment of prisoners and upholding human rights principles.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\nThis project examines the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies in European prisons, focusing on how mechanisms for securing rights and ensuring accountability are perceived and implemented. The PRILA project aims to achieve adherence to the rule of law and promote just imprisonment and good order, upholding the principles of justice, good order, and human rights. Despite the importance of ensuring fair treatment of prisoners and promoting just imprisonment, there is a significant research gap in understanding the overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences in prisons. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining legal, qualitative, and quantitative research, PRILA will document experiences, study decision-making structures, and analyze appeal and review processes to advance our understanding of penal power experiences. The project's impact will be transformative, extending accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advancing judicial review of administrative action, and enhancing understanding of penal power experiences. By supporting better penal policies and practices, PRILA will contribute to protecting the rule of law and human rights in European prisons.",
        "Here is a 300-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\nThe PRILA project aims to examine the experiences of mechanisms for securing rights and accountability in European prisons, with a focus on upholding the rule of law and promoting just imprisonment and good order. Despite their importance, the ways in which prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies experience and navigate these mechanisms remain overlooked. PRILA seeks to address this research gap by documenting the experiences of these stakeholders and studying the structures for fair, transparent, and consistent decisions, appeal and review processes, and compliance with human rights principles.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach combining public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and sociology of punishment, PRILA will create the first comprehensive account of how accountability and rights are experienced in European prisons. The project's objectives include creating an account of accountability work experiences and examining accountability structures as manifestations of penal ideologies. By advancing conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, PRILA will support better penal policies and practices, ultimately protecting the rule of law and rights in prisons.\n\nThe project's distinctiveness lies in its focus on the European experience of penal concepts, making it a timely and impactful contribution to the field. The expected outcomes of PRILA include transforming and extending accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advancing judicial review of administrative action, and enhancing our understanding of penal power experiences. By shedding light on the complex dynamics of accountability and rights in European prisons, PRILA will inform policy and practice, ultimately promoting fair treatment of prisoners and upholding human rights."
