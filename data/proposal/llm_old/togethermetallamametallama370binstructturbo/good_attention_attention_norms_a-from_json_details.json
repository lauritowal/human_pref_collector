        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Good Attention: Attention Norms and their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics (GOODATTENTION)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the fundamental norms governing human attention, a crucial aspect of cognitive and social functioning. The primary goal is to provide a philosophical framework for understanding attention norms, exploring how they emerge within individual psychology and in the social domain. Our hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance, and we will evaluate these norms through their integration into normative philosophy.\n\nThe project will employ a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, ethics, evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, economics, and political theory. Research activities will include investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social relevance in guiding attention by social norms, considering the role of attention norms in decision making, and analyzing ethical rights and duties regarding attention.\n\nThe expected impact of this project is significant, with potential to influence various philosophical fields by integrating norms of attention into their frameworks. Additionally, the project will provide an analytical framework for policy making, informing decision-making processes that rely on attention allocation. By developing a unified foundation for the study of attention norms using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind, this project promises to advance our understanding of attention and its role in shaping our individual and collective behavior.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Good Attention: Attention Norms and their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics (GOODATTENTION)\n\nThe GOODATTENTION project seeks to provide a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary investigation of attention norms and their far-reaching implications for philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and beyond. Our primary goal is to develop a novel philosophical framework for understanding attention norms, which we hypothesize are fundamentally concerned with relevance. To achieve this, we will pursue five key research activities: (1) investigating the biological function of relevance processing, (2) examining the role of social relevance in guiding attention by social norms, (3) considering the role of attention norms in decision making, (4) exploring the epistemic role of attention, and (5) analyzing ethical rights and duties regarding attention.\n\nBy integrating insights from multiple fields, we aim to understand how attention norms emerge within individual psychology and in the social domain, and to evaluate these norms through the lens of normative philosophy. Our expected impact is twofold: first, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of attention norms, influencing various philosophical fields, and second, we will provide a novel analytical framework for policy making. Ultimately, the GOODATTENTION project will develop a unified foundation for the study of attention norms, shedding new light on the complex relationships between attention, relevance, and decision making.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Good Attention: Attention Norms and their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics (GOODATTENTION)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, GOODATTENTION, aims to provide a philosophical investigation of attention norms and develop a framework for thinking about them. Attention norms, which govern how we allocate attention, play a crucial role in shaping our perception, decision-making, and social interactions. Despite their significance, attention norms remain understudied, particularly in the context of philosophy. This project seeks to fill this gap by exploring how attention norms emerge within individual psychology and in the social domain, and by evaluating these norms through the lens of normative philosophy.\n\nOur hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. To test this hypothesis, we will engage in a range of research activities, including investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social relevance in guiding attention, and analyzing the epistemic and ethical implications of attention norms. By developing a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind, this project will provide a unified foundation for the study of attention norms.\n\nThe expected impact of this project is significant, with potential to influence multiple fields, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and policy making. By integrating norms of attention into philosophical inquiry, we will provide a new analytical framework for understanding human behavior and decision-making, with implications for policy decisions and ethical considerations. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of attention and its role in shaping our individual and collective lives."
