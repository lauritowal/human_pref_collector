        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Rethinking China's Model of Urban Governance\n\nThis project seeks to fundamentally transform our understanding of China's urban governance by providing a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China. With world-historical significance, this research addresses the pressing theoretical and policy challenges of urbanization, development, and governance in China. Through a multi-scalar approach, combining ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers, we will investigate six case studies across coastal, central, and western regions, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. By examining recent national strategic projects, we will illuminate the complexities of China's entrepreneurial urban governance model. The project's timeliness is underscored by the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and ongoing trade tensions. This research will contribute significantly to theory by advancing our understanding of entrepreneurial urban governance and offer an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. The project will yield six workshops and a publication series, ensuring knowledge dissemination and impact. By rethinking China's model of urban governance, this project will have far-reaching implications for urban development, policy, and practice globally.",
        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Rethinking China's Model of Urban Governance\n\nThis project seeks to reexamine China's urban governance model, a phenomenon of world-historical significance, by addressing the theoretical and policy challenges it poses. Through a multi-scalar approach, investigating neighbourhoods, cities, and regions, we will employ ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers to provide a nuanced understanding of China's entrepreneurial urban governance. The project will conduct case studies in six strategically selected cities and regions, covering coastal, central, and western China, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. By analyzing recent national strategic projects, we will contextualize our research within the framework of the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and the current trade tensions.\n\nThe project aims to contribute to theory by developing the concept of entrepreneurial urban governance and offer an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. Over two years, we will organize six workshops and publish a series of books, providing a platform for knowledge exchange and dissemination. Our research will change the way we think about China and its governance, offering a grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China. By doing so, this project will inform policy debates and provide valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners interested in urban governance and development in China and beyond.",
        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Rethinking China's Model of Urban Governance\n\nThis project seeks to reconceptualize China's model of urban governance, addressing the significant theoretical and policy challenges posed by the country's rapid urbanization. Through a multi-scalar approach, investigating neighborhoods, cities, and regions, we will employ ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers to provide a nuanced understanding of China's urban transformation. Six case studies, spanning coastal, central, and western regions, will be conducted in Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, with a focus on recent national strategic projects.\n\nThe project's timeliness is underscored by the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and ongoing trade tensions. Our research will contribute to theory by developing the concept of entrepreneurial urban governance, and offer an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. We will organize six workshops and publish a series of papers, providing a theoretically grounded and empirically rich explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China. By challenging prevailing views, this project will change how we think about China and its governance, informing policy and scholarly debates on urbanization, state-society relations, and economic development. Ultimately, this research will provide a new framework for understanding China's urban future and its implications for the world."
