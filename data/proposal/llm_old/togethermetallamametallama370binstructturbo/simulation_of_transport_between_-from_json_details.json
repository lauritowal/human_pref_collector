        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\nThe STRADA project proposes the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system to reconstruct and analyze the ancient transport network between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube River during the Roman Empire. This innovative approach will enable researchers to study the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, and investigate how environmental factors influenced the transport system. By integrating experimental data, historical research, and technological advancements, STRADA will introduce dynamic simulations into historical research, providing new insights into the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe simulation system will feature a modular design, allowing for sustainable use and future extension. It will incorporate local fine-grained topography, historical weather data, and various means of transport with different loads, as well as factors such as fatigue, rests, and loading times. The project will focus on reconstructing ancient land and water routes, experimentally determining the performance of different transport modes under changing environmental conditions, and developing a time-related simulation system.\n\nBy simulating realistic transport times and scenarios, STRADA will contribute significantly to our understanding of the Roman Empire's economic dynamics and the interconnectedness of its territories. The project's results will have far-reaching implications for the fields of archaeology, history, and environmental studies, and will provide a new framework for analyzing ancient transport systems.",

The system will be designed for sustainable use and future extension. The research will focus on the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscape. By introducing dynamic simulations into historical research, STRADA will provide new insights into the Roman Empire's economic and social structures, shedding light on the complex relationships between transportation, economy, and environment. The project's outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of the Roman Empire's cohesion and stability, with implications for the study of ancient civilizations and historical research methods.",
        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\nThe STRADA project proposes to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system to model water and land-borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube during the Roman Empire. This innovative approach will reconstruct ancient land and water routes, experimentally determine the performance of various transport means under changing environmental conditions, and develop a time-related simulation system. The simulation system will feature local fine-grained topography, historical weather data, different means of transport with varying loads, fatigue of actors, and necessary rests and loading times.\n\nBy combining technological developments, experimental data, and historical research, STRADA aims to simulate realistic transport times and understand the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire. The project will focus on the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscape, providing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier.\n\nThe modular design approach will ensure sustainable use and future extension of the simulation system. STRADA's outcomes will introduce dynamic simulations into historical research, enabling a more accurate understanding of the ancient transport system and its influence on the Roman Empire's economy and society. By exploring the ancient transport network, STRADA will provide valuable insights into the infrastructure, logistics, and economic dynamics of the Roman Empire, shedding new light on this critical period in European history."
