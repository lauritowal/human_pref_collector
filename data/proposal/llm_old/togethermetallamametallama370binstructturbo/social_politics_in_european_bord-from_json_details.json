        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Social Politics in European Borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s\n\nThis project reframes the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by examining the role of local actors in shaping social politics in three borderland regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. Focusing on the period from the 1870s to the 1990s, this comparative and transnational study will investigate how local welfare structures were co-constructed by public and private actors, exploring the intersections of national and non-national identities and solidarities.\n\nThrough a rigorous comparative analysis and transnational frameworks, this project will examine the inclusion and exclusion of different social groups in welfare provision, analyze the competition between various social provision actors, and trace the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. By shedding light on the historically neglected contributions of local actors, this study will inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address pressing social rights issues in Europe.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex dynamics of social politics in European borderlands, providing a nuanced and contextualized perspective on the development of welfare states. Ultimately, this research will offer a fresh perspective on the history of social care in modern Europe, highlighting the agency of local actors and the transnational dimensions of social politics.",

Focusing on three regions - Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions - between the 1870s and 1990s, this study will explore how local welfare structures and national and non-national identities influenced social care provision. Through a comparative and transnational approach, we will analyze the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors, and the interactions between them. Our research will investigate how local actors contributed to the development of social welfare, and how these contributions were shaped by and influenced national and transnational processes.\n\nBy examining the inclusion and exclusion of certain groups in welfare provision, the competition between different social provision models, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the historical development of social politics in European borderlands. The study's findings will inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address pressing social rights issues in Europe. By highlighting the agency of local actors in shaping social care, this project will challenge dominant narratives of national and European-level policy-making, and contribute to a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of social politics in modern Europe.",

Focusing on three key regions - Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions - this comparative and transnational study will explore how local welfare structures were co-constructed by public and private actors, influencing the provision of social services and the formation of national and non-national identities.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis of these border regions, this project will investigate the contributions of local actors to welfare provision, the interaction between public and private actors, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. The project's anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, the dynamics of competition in social provision, and the tracing of transnational flows of ideas and practices.\n\nThis historical study has significant relevance for contemporary debates on welfare reform and social rights in Europe. By highlighting the agency of local actors in shaping social politics, this project will inform policy discussions on the role of local communities in delivering social services and promoting social cohesion. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of social politics in modern Europe, shedding light on the ways in which local actors have shaped, and continue to shape, the contours of welfare and social care."
