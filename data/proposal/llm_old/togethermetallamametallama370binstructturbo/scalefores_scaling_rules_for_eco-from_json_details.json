        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping\n\nThe SCALEFORES project aims to develop and test a novel methodological framework for mapping relationships between ecosystem services using existing data. This framework will address the challenge of reliably mapping relationships between multiple ecosystem services, enabling multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. By examining the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and underpinning social and ecological variables, we will create maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The methodology will be validated against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe, a region with the best data on ecosystem services globally. \n\nThe project will utilize existing data on land cover, soil type, and human population density to produce accurate maps of relationships between ecosystem services. The anticipated outcomes of this project include increased ability to map distributions of ecosystem services, enabling more effective conservation and management of ecosystems. By providing a better understanding of the complex relationships between ecosystem services, this project will inform policy and decision-making at local, national, and international scales. The SCALEFORES project has the potential to make a significant impact on the sustainable management of ecosystems, and we believe it is an important investment for the future of ecosystem service research.",
