        "Here is a 266-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project proposes a multi-methodological, pan-European study to investigate the intricate relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work. Focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors in the European Union, this project seeks to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the complex dynamics between identity and work. By exploring subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which neo-craft workers navigate and make sense of their work in the face of an uncertain future. \n\nThe project's innovative approach combines digital methods with qualitative research, marking a significant departure from traditional studies on work and identity. By doing so, CRAFTWORK will provide the first comprehensive inquiry into 'neo-craft' work in the EU, rethinking interpretative categories for the study of identity and work. Ultimately, this project will contribute to critical studies of new forms of work, addressing the pressing societal challenges of the future of work.",

Focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors in the European Union, this project seeks to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the identity-work nexus. By examining subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media, CRAFTWORK will provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complex ways in which identity shapes and is shaped by work.\n\nThis innovative project addresses the pressing challenge of the future of work, which is transforming the nature of employment and the meaning of work in society. By combining digital methods with qualitative research, CRAFTWORK will break new ground in empirical, methodological, and theoretical terms. As the first comprehensive inquiry into \"neo-craft\" work in the EU, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of the changing world of work and its implications for individuals, communities, and societies. Ultimately, CRAFTWORK aims to contribute to critical studies of new forms of work, informing policies and practices that promote a more equitable and sustainable future of work.",
