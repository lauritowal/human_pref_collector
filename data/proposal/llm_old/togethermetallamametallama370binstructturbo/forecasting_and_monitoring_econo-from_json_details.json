        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators\n\nThis Proof of Concept grant proposal, submitted to the European Research Council (ERC), aims to develop a novel software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring economic indicators. Building upon the success of our previous ERC grant (ERC-2007-StG, \"Change-Point Tests\"), this project seeks to improve the accuracy and reliability of economic forecasts, enabling informed decision-making by governments, Central Banks, and firms.\n\nOur proposed software will introduce several innovative features, including real-time monitoring, predictive breakdown tests, and the incorporation of high-frequency information. These advancements will be made possible by the development of a novel model family, designed to capture complex economic dynamics. The software will be user-friendly, featuring three-dimensional graphical representations and ensuring accessibility to decision-makers.\n\nThe ultimate objective of this project is to improve economic forecasts and decision-making, leading to prudent economic policy, economic growth, and enhanced economic and social welfare. We have established contacts with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank, ensuring a strong foundation for collaboration and eventual uptake of our software.\n\nBy pushing the boundaries of current methods, our project has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of economic forecasting and policy-making. We believe that this ERC Proof of Concept grant will provide the necessary resources to bring our vision to life, ultimately contributing to more informed and effective economic decision-making.",

Building upon our previous ERC-funded project, \"Change-Point Tests\" (ERC-2007-StG), this project seeks to improve economic forecasts and decision making by providing a real-time monitoring system with predictive breakdown tests. Our proposed software will integrate a novel model family, leveraging high-frequency information to enhance the accuracy and reliability of economic forecasts. The toolbox will be designed with user-friendly accessibility in mind, featuring three-dimensional graphical representations to facilitate informed decision making among target users, including governments, Central Banks, and firms. \n\nEstablished collaborations with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank will ensure the practical relevance and applicability of our proposed software. The ultimate objective of this project is to improve economic policy, drive economic growth, and enhance economic and social welfare. By developing a cutting-edge forecasting and monitoring system, we can empower decision makers to make more informed, data-driven choices, ultimately contributing to more prudent economic policy and improved economic outcomes.",
