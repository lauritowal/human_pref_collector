        "Here is a 201-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\n\nThis project proposes to create a comprehensive digital archive of personal letters written by ordinary individuals in 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain. Focusing on the writings of servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, this archive will provide a unique window into the daily lives and experiences of non-elite individuals during this period. The letters, often produced in the context of interactions with institutions such as the Inquisition and civil courts, will be systematically collected, edited, and subjected to historical-linguistic study. Sociological interviews will also be conducted to provide additional context. The project's output will include a large collection assembly, online digital edition, philological treatment, and cultural and linguistic study. Employing rigorous editing standards based on Textual Criticism, this archive will facilitate a well-contextualized study of inter-personal modes of relation and traditional communities. The letters' content, characterized by oral rhetoric, emotional expression, commonsense statements, and narration of trivial incidents, will offer a fresh perspective on the social and cultural history of early modern Iberia.",
        "Here is a 201-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\n\nThis project aims to create a comprehensive digital archive of personal letters written by ordinary individuals in Portugal and Spain from the 17th to early 19th century. Focusing on the writings of servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, this archive will provide a unique window into the daily lives and experiences of marginalized voices from the past. The systematic collection and edition of these letters will involve a historical-linguistic study, complemented by sociological interviews to contextualize the findings. The study will examine inter-personal modes of relation, traditional communities, and the expression of emotions, commonsense statements, and non-orthodox beliefs in these writings. The project's output will consist of a large collection assembly, online digital edition, philological treatment, and cultural and linguistic study, adhering to the standards of Textual Criticism. By making these previously unknown or inaccessible documents available, Post Scriptum will contribute significantly to our understanding of early modern European culture and society, and provide a valuable resource for scholars and the general public alike.",

The collection will feature letters penned by servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, offering a unique window into the everyday lives of non-elite individuals. The archival materials will be sourced from the Inquisition and civil courts, and will be systematically collected, edited, and subjected to historical-linguistic study. Sociological interviews will provide additional context. The project's focus is on the well-contextualized study of inter-personal modes of relation within traditional communities, as reflected in the content characteristics of the letters, including oral rhetoric, emotional expression, commonsense statements, non-orthodox beliefs, and trivial incident narration. The project's output will be a large, online digital edition of the letters, accompanied by philological treatment and cultural and linguistic study. The editing standards will adhere to principles of Textual Criticism. By making these ordinary writings accessible, Post Scriptum will provide a transformative understanding of early modern Portuguese and Spanish society."
