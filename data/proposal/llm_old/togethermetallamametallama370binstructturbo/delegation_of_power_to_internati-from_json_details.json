        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time\n\nThis project investigates the delegation of power to international organizations (IOs) and their subsequent empowerment over time. Despite an increase in IOs and varied levels of authority surrendered to them, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. Through a comparative, longitudinal research design, this study examines the empowerment of four IOs - the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO - from 1986 to 2010. It explores how temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design influence the delegation of power and IO empowerment. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, this project aims to develop a model of power delegation that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent framework. The research will involve qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials. The objective is to provide insights into the consequences of power delegation and advance theoretical and empirical research in International Relations. By shedding light on the complex dynamics of IO empowerment, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of IOs in global governance and inform policy decisions on delegation of power to IOs.",

This longitudinal, comparative study will examine the surrender of authority to IOs, such as the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO, from 1986 to 2010. By integrating insights from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, this research will develop a temporal model of power delegation, building on the principal-agent approach.\n\nThe project will explore how factors such as temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design influence the empowerment of IOs. Using qualitative methods, including archives research and elite interviews with national and international officials, this study will provide new insights into the consequences of power delegation and contribute to the advancement of theoretical and empirical International Relations research.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the dynamics of power delegation, the development of a temporal model of institutional empowerment, and a comprehensive analysis of the implications of this phenomenon for global governance. By shedding light on the complex relationships between states and IOs, this research will inform policy debates and contribute to more effective international cooperation. Ultimately, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the delegation of power to IOs and its consequences, advancing our knowledge of international relations and global governance.",

Despite the increasing importance of IOs in global governance, the dynamics of power delegation and its consequences remain understudied. This research aims to address this gap by developing a model that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach, examining how IOs such as the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO have acquired authority over time.\n\nThrough a comparative and longitudinal research design, this project will analyze the factors influencing IO empowerment, including temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design. The study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials.\n\nBy examining the steady extension of authority to some IOs (e.g., EU, IMF) and the constant level of authority surrendered to others (e.g., GATT/WTO-Secretariat, NATO), this project will provide insights into the consequences of power delegation and contribute to the advancement of theoretical and empirical research in International Relations. The proposed research will shed light on the complex relationships between states and IOs, ultimately informing policy debates on the role of IOs in global governance."
