        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\n\nThis project proposes a groundbreaking framework to understand the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. Focusing on Buddhism, our research will reconstruct the complex networks of exchange and localization that shaped the region's religious landscape from the 6th to the 14th centuries. By adopting a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, we will analyze the intricate relationships between Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan cultures, revealing the multi-layered dynamics of Buddhist transmission and adaptation.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach combining philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies, we will investigate the spatial and temporal aspects of Buddhist networks, highlighting the agency of local actors and the role of cultural encounter in shaping religious transfer. Our unique perspective will demonstrate how the analysis of religious exchange as a dynamic network can shed new light on the history of Eastern Central Asia and its significance in comparative religious studies.\n\nBy integrating Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into the broader field of comparative religious studies, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of cultural exchange and religious transfer, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the region's rich cultural heritage.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\n\nThis project seeks to establish a novel framework for understanding the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia, focusing on the spread and localization of Buddhism from the 6th to the 14th centuries. By adopting a trans-regional and trans-cultural approach, we will reconstruct the Buddhist network in Eastern Central Asia, analyzing the complex relationships between Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan cultures.\n\nOur research will integrate philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies to investigate the multifaceted process of Buddhist localization in Eastern Central Asia. We will examine the spatial and temporal aspects of religious exchange, moving beyond traditional nation-state or regional boundaries to reveal the dynamic networks that facilitated the transmission of Buddhist ideas, practices, and art forms.\n\nThis project offers a unique perspective on religious exchange, conceptualizing it as a dynamic network that evolved over time and space. By examining the intersections and interactions between different cultural and religious traditions, we will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex history of Buddhism in Eastern Central Asia. Our findings will contribute significantly to the field of comparative religious studies, shedding new light on the mechanisms of religious transfer and the local adaptations of Buddhism in a pivotal region.",

We will develop a new perspective on religious exchange as a dynamic network, highlighting the interdependencies and reciprocal influences between different cultural and religious traditions. This project will integrate Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into Comparative Religious Studies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the region's cultural and religious heritage.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a reconstruction of the Buddhist network in Eastern Central Asia, a deeper understanding of the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer, and a new framework for analyzing religious exchange in pre-modern contexts. This research will have significant implications for the fields of Buddhist studies, cultural history, and comparative religious studies, and will provide a new perspective on the complex cultural and religious landscape of Eastern Central Asia."
