        "Here is a 261-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\n\nThis project seeks to illuminate the conceptual foundations of India's political life by examining the ideas that guide ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement. Despite India's status as the world's largest democracy and a rising global power, little is known about the vernacular languages and concepts that shape its political culture. Through an innovative ethnographic and historical approach, our interdisciplinary team of anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics will scrutinize the vernacular languages of India's political life. Inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, our objectives are threefold: to establish an empirical and analytical foundation for a vernacular lexicography of India's political life, to develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, and to explore the implications for global political theory in collaboration with European political ideas scholars. By exploring India's demotic political ideas through vernacular languages, this project promises to advance our understanding of subcontinental politics, provide methodological insights beyond Europe, and contribute to analytical advances towards global political theory. Ultimately, this project will lay the groundwork for a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of India's political life and its significance in the global arena.",

        "Here is a 261-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\n\nThis project seeks to explore the conceptual foundations of India's political life through a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary study of vernacular languages. Despite India's status as the world's largest democracy and a rising global power, little is known about the ideas that guide ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement. To address this knowledge gap, our research will employ ethnographic and historical scrutiny, combining the expertise of anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics. We will focus on the vernacular languages of India's political life, laying the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of Indian political concepts. A key output will be an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, a novel resource for scholars and policymakers. Inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, our project will explore the implications of our findings for global political theory in collaboration with European scholars. The potential impacts of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to transform our understanding of subcontinental politics, offer methodological insights beyond Europe, and advance global political theory. By examining India's demotic political ideas through vernacular languages, this project promises to open up new avenues for research and scholarship."
