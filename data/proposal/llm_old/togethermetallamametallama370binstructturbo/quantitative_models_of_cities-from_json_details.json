        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Quantitative Models of Cities\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop and apply cutting-edge quantitative models to better understand the economic dynamics of cities, with a focus on the 20th century and recent changes. The project aims to address significant knowledge gaps in the field, building on the foundations laid by seminal works such as Ahlfeldt et al. (2015) and Heblich et al. (2020).\n\nOur approach combines the strengths of quantitative models with the richness of register data, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of economic divergence across and within countries, as well as between cities and rural areas. The project's innovations include the development of a dynamic model that incorporates worker and firm heterogeneity, and the use of detailed Danish data to inform policy-relevant questions.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold. First, we will develop a comprehensive framework for understanding the drivers of urban economic growth and decline. Second, we will apply this framework to investigate the impact of policy interventions on cities, including the effects of urban transport infrastructure, height restrictions, and planning interventions. Third, we will provide actionable insights for policymakers seeking to promote sustainable and equitable urban development.\n\nBy pushing the boundaries of quantitative modeling and data analysis, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of urban economies and inform evidence-based policy decisions. Ultimately, the project's goal is to contribute to the development of more resilient, prosperous, and environmentally sustainable cities for the 21st century.",
        "Title: Quantitative Models of Cities\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Quantitative Models of Cities,\" aims to develop a novel framework for understanding the dynamics of urban development and growth. Building on recent theoretical breakthroughs and high-resolution data, this project will combine quantitative models with register data to provide a comprehensive understanding of economic divergence across and within countries, as well as between cities and rural areas. With a focus on the 20th century, the project will explore the historical context of urbanization and its impact on economic outcomes.\n\nThe project's innovative approach will involve developing a dynamic model that accounts for worker and firm heterogeneity, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of urban phenomena. Furthermore, the project will utilize detailed Danish data to address policy-relevant questions, including the impact of urban transport infrastructure, height restrictions, and planning interventions on city development.\n\nBy providing a quantitative framework for understanding urban dynamics, this project will inform policy decisions and contribute to the development of more sustainable and equitable cities. The proposed research will build on the foundations laid by previous studies, such as Ahlfeldt et al. (2015) and Heblich et al. (2020), and will push the boundaries of urban economics research.",
        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Quantitative Models of Cities\n\nThis proposal aims to develop innovative quantitative models of cities, combining cutting-edge theoretical approaches with high-resolution data to address pressing policy questions. The project focuses on understanding economic divergence across and within countries, as well as the dynamics of urban development versus rural areas. We will draw on the 20th century as a historical niche of interest, building on recent breakthroughs in the field.\n\nOur approach innovates on existing models by combining quantitative frameworks with detailed register data, developing a dynamic model that accounts for worker and firm heterogeneity. We will utilize rich Danish data to estimate the model, allowing for a deeper understanding of urban phenomena. The project's key objectives are to address three policy-relevant questions: (1) How can urban transport infrastructure be optimized to promote economic growth? (2) What are the effects of height restrictions on urban development and economic outcomes? (3) How can planning interventions be designed to improve the sustainability and efficiency of cities?\n\nOur proposed project builds on the foundational work of Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), pushing the frontier of urban economics research. By developing a novel, dynamic model of cities, we will provide policymakers with evidence-based tools to inform their decisions and shape the future of urban development. The project's outcomes will have far-reaching implications for urban planning, economic policy, and sustainable development."
