        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis\n\nThis project proposes a novel framework for understanding body image as a dynamic inference, shaped by the interplay between prior expectations and new information. In today's modern context, where body modification options are increasingly prevalent, individuals must constantly negotiate their identity, balancing invariance and invention. METABODY aims to investigate the metacognitive level of body image, examining how individuals integrate embodied experience with external and social perspectives. Our hypothesis is that disturbances in body image are related to impairments in first- and second-order abilities, such as mentalizing and metacognition. To test this, we will conduct three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making, each focusing on a distinct aspect of identity negotiation. By elucidating the complex processes underlying body image, METABODY seeks to provide a deeper understanding of how individuals navigate the multifaceted landscape of body modification options, ultimately informing strategies for promoting positive body image and well-being.",
        "Here is a 285-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis\n\nThe METABODY project proposes a novel concept of Body Imaging, which captures the dynamic inference of body image based on prior expectations and new information. In today's modern context, body image is a critical aspect of identity, requiring a delicate balance between invariance and invention. This project focuses on body image as a dynamic inference, balancing prior beliefs and new information, and investigates the metacognitive level of body image processing.\n\nWe hypothesize that body image disturbances are related to impairments in 1st and 2nd order abilities, such as metacognition and mentalization. To test this hypothesis, the project consists of three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making. These packages will examine the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives, social perspectives, and current, future, and ideal body perspectives, respectively.\n\nThe ultimate goal of METABODY is to understand identity negotiation in the context of body modification options. By shedding light on the complex dynamics of body image, this project will provide valuable insights into the psychological and social factors that influence body modification decisions, ultimately informing strategies for promoting positive body image and well-being. The innovative approach of METABODY has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of body image and its relationship to identity, with far-reaching implications for fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and public health.",
        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis\n\nThe METABODY project proposes a novel concept, Body Imagining, to understand the dynamic inference of body image based on prior expectations and new information. In today's modern context, individuals constantly negotiate their identity, balancing invariance and invention. This project focuses on the study of body image as a dynamic inference, examining how individuals balance prior beliefs and new information to form their body image. We hypothesize that body image disturbances are related to impairments in first- and second-order abilities. To investigate this, we will conduct three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition, examining the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives; Body Mentalizing, exploring the balance between embodied experience and social perspectives; and Body Decision Making, analyzing the balance between current, future, and ideal body perspectives. The ultimate goal of METABODY is to understand identity negotiation in the context of body modification options, providing insights into the metacognitive and mentalizing processes that underlie body image formation and transformation. By advancing our understanding of these complex processes, METABODY aims to contribute to the development of novel interventions for body image disturbances."
