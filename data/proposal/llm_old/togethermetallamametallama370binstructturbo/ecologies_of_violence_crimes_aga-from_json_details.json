        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination\n\nThis project, \"Ecologies of Violence,\" proposes a groundbreaking framework for the study of environmental violence and its representation in cultural expressions. By integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will develop an innovative ecological model to examine the intersections of violence, colonialism, and genocide, and their impact on the natural world. Our objectives include documenting how cultural expressions represent ecoviolence, analyzing the emotional and affective dimensions of these representations, and exploring how they can foster critical self-reflection and environmental crisis awareness.\n\nThrough a comparative and transnational analysis, we will investigate the ways in which cultural memory and ecocriticism can be reoriented to consider more-than-human terms. Our research will culminate in a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for pedagogy engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence. By providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms, \"Ecologies of Violence\" aims to contribute to the development of critical literacies about ecoviolence and promote a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between human and non-human entities. Ultimately, this project seeks to inspire new perspectives on environmental violence, cultural memory, and ecocriticism, and to inform strategies for mitigating the devastating effects of ecoviolence on our planet.",

By examining how literature, art, and media represent environmental violence, we will document the intricate links between ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide, and analyze how cultural representations reflect on guilt, responsibility, and culture's implication in violence. Our research will also explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to relate to environmental crises and promote critical self-reflection.\n\nThrough a comparative, transnational analysis integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will produce a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for pedagogical engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence. This innovative framework will reorient cultural memory research and ecocriticism to consider more-than-human terms, providing a new lens through which to understand the complex relationships between humans, non-humans, and the environment.\n\nUltimately, \"Ecologies of Violence\" aims to provide a critical framework for thinking about violence and memory in more-than-human terms, enabling scholars, educators, and the broader public to better understand and address the far-reaching consequences of environmental violence. By doing so, we hope to foster critical literacies about ecoviolence and inspire new approaches to environmental crisis relation and critical self-reflection.",
        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination\n\nThis project, Ecologies of Violence, proposes an innovative ecological model for understanding violence and its representation in cultural expressions. By examining the intersections of ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide, we will map the complex relationships between human and non-human actors in the perpetuation of environmental violence. Through a comparative and transnational analysis, we will document how cultural representations reflect and shape our understanding of ecoviolence, guilt, responsibility, and cultural complicity. Our study will also explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to relate to environmental crises and promote critical self-reflection.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: (1) to develop a new ecological model for studying violence and its representation, (2) to create a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture, and (3) to produce a best practices guide for pedagogical engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence. By integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will reorient these fields to consider more-than-human terms, providing a framework for thinking about violence and memory in a new light. Ultimately, Ecologies of Violence aims to foster critical literacies about ecoviolence, promoting a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between humans, non-humans, and the environment."
