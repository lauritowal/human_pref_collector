        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe during MIS3\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the subsistence strategies of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) in response to sudden climatic events during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Southern European peninsulas. By analyzing 20 archaeological sites, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach combining zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions. Our objectives are to assess the behavioural flexibility and resilience of both species, develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity, and understand the subsistence patterns that favored AMH. This research will provide new insights into the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction and AMH colonization, shedding light on the dynamics of human adaptation and resilience in the face of environmental change. The project's pan-European scope will contribute significantly to the field of prehistory, offering a comprehensive understanding of human-climate interactions during a critical period in human history. Ultimately, this research will inform our understanding of the complex relationships between climate, environment, and human societies, with implications for contemporary climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

Our objectives are to assess the behavioural flexibility and resilience of these human species, develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity, and identify subsistence strategies in response to climatic changes. This research will provide insights into the prehistory of Europe on a pan-European scale, shedding light on the factors that contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals and the colonization of AMH. The expected outcomes include an understanding of the subsistence patterns that favored AMH and an assessment of the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction. By exploring the intricate relationships between climate, environment, and human adaptation, this project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of human resilience and adaptation in the face of sudden climatic events, with implications for contemporary climate change research and mitigation strategies.",

Our methodology combines zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions. We aim to develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity and identify the subsistence patterns that favored AMH over Neanderthals. This research will provide new insights into the role of climate change in Neanderthal extinction and AMH colonization, shedding light on the complex interplay between human populations and their environments. The project's outcomes will have significant implications for our understanding of human adaptability and resilience in the face of climate change, with relevance to the study of prehistory on a pan-European scale. By exploring the dynamics of human-environment interactions in the past, we can better inform strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on modern human societies."
