        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\n\nThis ethnographic project aims to investigate the phenomenon of material creativity in clinics, focusing on the ways healthcare professionals and support staff repurpose and reuse materials to address resource shortages and wastefulness. Through a globally oriented study, we will explore the conditions that enable creative material engagement in clinics, shedding light on the improvisational practices that often go unnoticed in medical settings.\n\nOur five-subproject design will take place in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., involving ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff as participants. We will employ fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets to gather data. By moving beyond the traditional patient-encounter focus in hospital ethnographies, this project will contribute to the development of new methods for reusing and sharing research materials.\n\nThe proposed study will advance theories of materiality, addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. Our practical outcomes will articulate the conditions necessary for healthcare creativity and local solutions to wastefulness and shortage. Ultimately, The Upcycled Clinic will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between materiality, creativity, and healthcare, informing strategies to reduce waste and promote resourcefulness in medical settings worldwide.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\n\nThe Upcycled Clinic is a pioneering ethnographic project that tackles the pressing issue of wastefulness in medicine by exploring the creative ways healthcare professionals repurpose materials in clinical settings. Through a globally oriented study, we will investigate the conditions that foster innovative material engagements in five clinics located in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K. Our research team, comprising ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff, will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets to uncover the improvisational strategies employed by healthcare workers to overcome resource shortages and minimize waste.\n\nThis project marks a significant departure from traditional hospital ethnographies, which have focused primarily on patient encounters. By shifting the lens to the material practices of healthcare workers, we will develop new insights into the ways in which creativity and resourcefulness are mobilized to address everyday challenges in the clinic. The study's contributions will be threefold: advancing theories of materiality, addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace, and developing novel methods for reusing and sharing research materials. Ultimately, our research aims to articulate the conditions necessary for healthcare creativity and identify local solutions to wastefulness and shortage, informing strategies for more sustainable and effective healthcare systems worldwide.",

Through a globally oriented study, we will explore how healthcare workers in diverse settings repurpose and reuse materials to overcome shortages and improve care. Our approach involves five sub-projects in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., engaging ethnographers, cleaners, laundry staff, and other stakeholders in fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets.\n\nBy moving beyond the traditional focus on patient encounters, this project will contribute to the advancement of hospital ethnographies and theories of materiality. Our research will also develop innovative methods for reusing and sharing research materials, promoting resilience and innovation in the workplace. The practical outcomes of this project will articulate the conditions necessary for healthcare creativity and inform local solutions to address wastefulness and shortage.\n\nUltimately, The Upcycled Clinic aims to inspire a shift towards more sustainable and resourceful healthcare practices, improving the quality of care while reducing waste and environmental impact. By exploring the creative ways healthcare workers respond to material constraints, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between people, materials, and care in contemporary medicine."
