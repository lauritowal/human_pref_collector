        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\nThis project investigates the critical role of charitable food provision (CFP) in alleviating food insecurity among urban poor populations. Despite its importance, CFP lacks a robust framework for cross-country and city comparisons, and its dynamics are poorly understood within welfare and civil society regimes. Our research addresses these gaps by charting the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, and examining CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. We will employ innovative methodologies, including event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, to explore the interdependence between food insecurity and support. Our focus areas include professionalized CFP sectors, provider interrelationships, and ties with state and non-state authorities, as well as CFP's role in poor people's survival strategies. A novel tool for real-time data collection in city workshops will be developed and tested. By creating new knowledge across multiple studies, this project will offer comparative insights into food support and insecurity, ultimately informing policy and practice to reduce food insecurity and promote sustainable food systems. The proposed research has significant implications for understanding the complex relationships between food insecurity, poverty, and charitable food provision, and will contribute to the development of more effective solutions to address these pressing issues.",
        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\nThis project seeks to understand the dynamics of charitable food provision (CFP) and its role in addressing food insecurity among the urban poor in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. Despite its increasing importance as a buffer against hunger, CFP remains understudied, particularly in comparative perspective. Our research aims to fill this knowledge gap by charting the historical trajectory of CFP in each country and examining its dynamics in three cities: Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. We will investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support, and develop an innovative tool for real-time data collection in city workshops. Our mixed-methods approach combines event sequence analysis, social network analysis, and urban ethnography to examine the professionalized CFP sectors, providers' interrelationships, and operational modes, as well as their ties with state and non-state authorities. By exploring CFP as part of poor people's survival strategies, we will create new knowledge and offer comparative insights into food support and insecurity. Our findings will inform the development of a framework for CFP comparison across countries and cities, ultimately contributing to the reduction of food waste and the promotion of agri-food sustainability transitions. The project's anticipated impact will extend beyond the three case studies, providing a foundation for future research and policy development in other countries and cities.",
        "Here is a 272-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\nThis project aims to investigate the role of charitable food provision (CFP) in mitigating food insecurity among urban poor populations in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. Despite its crucial importance as a buffer against hunger, CFP remains poorly understood, particularly in comparative and cross-national contexts. This research seeks to address this knowledge gap by charting the historical trajectory of CFP in each country, examining CFP dynamics in three city case studies (Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam), and investigating the interdependence between food insecurity and support.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach combining event sequence analysis, social network analysis, and urban ethnography, this project will explore the professionalized CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings, providers' interrelationships and operational modes, and their ties with state and non-state authorities. The research will also investigate CFP as part of poor people's survival strategies and develop an innovative tool for real-time data collection in city workshops.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project is significant, offering a new framework for comparing CFP across countries and cities, and providing comparative insights into food support and insecurity. The findings will extend beyond the three case study countries, informing policy and practice in addressing food insecurity and promoting sustainable food systems globally."
