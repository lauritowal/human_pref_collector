        "Here is a 253-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Epigenetics, Experience, and Responsibility: Implications for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NEUROEPIGENETHICS)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project explores the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders, focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). NEUROEPIGENETHICS investigates how social and physical environmental factors influence epigenetic mechanisms, challenging traditional notions of innate vs. acquired and genetic vs. environmental contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders. By integrating theoretical and empirical approaches, we will examine the conceptual shifts required to reconcile epigenetic insights with normative and capacity responsibility frameworks. Our research will engage persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families as key stakeholders, ensuring that our findings are informed by and relevant to their experiences.\n\nThe project's primary objectives are to: (1) elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders, (2) explore the ethical implications of these mechanisms for responsibility attribution, and (3) develop a framework for normative responsibility that accommodates the interplay between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. By addressing these complex questions, NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to generate new insights into the ethical dimensions of neurodevelopmental disorders, ultimately informing more equitable and effective support structures for affected individuals and their families.",
        "Here is a 253-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Epigenetics, Experience, and Responsibility: Implications for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NEUROEPIGENETHICS)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, NEUROEPIGENETHICS, aims to explore the complex relationships between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), we will investigate how social and physical environmental factors influence epigenetic processes, and in turn, impact the development and expression of these disorders. Our research will challenge traditional dichotomies, such as innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, and biological/psychosocial, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches, we will examine the implications of epigenetics for our understanding of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings will have significant implications for the way we assign responsibility and make moral judgments about individuals with these conditions. This project will engage with persons with neurodevelopmental disorders, their families, and relevant stakeholders to ensure that our research is informed by their experiences and concerns. Ultimately, NEUROEPIGENETHICS seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive and empathetic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders, promoting a shift towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",

Through a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, we will explore how epigenetic research reframes our understanding of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. This project will engage with persons with neurodevelopmental disorders, their families, and relevant professional stakeholders to ensure that the research is informed by their experiences and concerns. The NEUROEPIGENETHICS project has significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility, and will inform the development of more nuanced and equitable approaches to ethics, policy, and practice in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders."
