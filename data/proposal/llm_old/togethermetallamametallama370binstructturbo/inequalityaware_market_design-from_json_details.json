        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality-aware Market Design\n\nThis project proposes to develop a novel framework for designing marketplaces that account for inequalities in the distribution of resources. Traditional market design approaches prioritize allocative efficiency, but often lead to undesirable surplus splits that exacerbate social and economic inequalities. Our project, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), seeks to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that balance efficiency with redistributive preferences.\n\nUsing a mechanism-design framework, we will investigate how policymakers can introduce rules and resource allocation mechanisms that mitigate inequalities, while minimizing allocative inefficiency. We will analyze scenarios such as rent control, healthcare, and transit, where policymakers often intervene in markets to address inequality concerns. Our approach will incorporate private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights to design markets that maximize welfare with redistributive preferences.\n\nOur main hypothesis is that detectable inequalities can justify sacrificing some allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable surplus split. We anticipate that our research will contribute to a better understanding of market interventions, such as inefficient rationing, and provide policy guidance on how to address inequality concerns through market design. Ultimately, our project aims to provide a new theoretical framework for inequality-aware market design, complementing traditional public-finance approaches through the tax system.",
        "Here is a 261-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality-aware Market Design\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach to market design that explicitly addresses inequality concerns. Conventional market design focuses on allocative efficiency, but often overlooks distributive implications. In contrast, our Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD) framework integrates redistributive preferences into the design of marketplaces. We will explore how policymakers can introduce rules constraining transactions and distribute scarce resources without markets, while minimizing allocative inefficiency. Our theoretical framework will be applied to policy examples such as rent control, healthcare, and transit.\n\nUsing a mechanism-design framework, we will maximize welfare with redistributive preferences, taking into account private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights. Our main hypothesis is that sacrificing allocative efficiency can lead to a desirable surplus split when inequalities are detectable. Our research will provide theoretical contributions by addressing inequality in market-design settings and distinguishing from traditional mechanism-design focus on efficiency and revenue. The project's outcomes will offer policy guidance on distortionary market interventions in light of inequality concerns, complementing public-finance approaches through the tax system. By developing an inequality-aware market design framework, this project aims to provide policymakers with a powerful tool to promote a more equitable distribution of resources.",
        "Here is a 261-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality-aware Market Design\n\nThis project proposes to develop a novel theoretical framework, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that account for inequalities. Conventional market design approaches prioritize allocative efficiency, but often overlook issues of distributional fairness. In contrast, IMD seeks to maximize welfare with redistributive preferences, sacrificing allocative efficiency if necessary to achieve a desirable surplus split when inequalities are detectable. \n\nOur methodology employs a mechanism-design framework, taking into account private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights. We hypothesize that inefficient rationing may result from prioritizing fairness over efficiency. Theoretical contributions of this project include addressing inequality in market-design settings and distinguishing from traditional mechanism-design focuses on efficiency and revenue. \n\nThe project's policy guidance will explain distortionary market interventions, such as rent control, healthcare, and transit, in light of inequality concerns. Our approach complements public-finance solutions through the tax system, providing policymakers with a more comprehensive understanding of inequality-aware market design. By exploring the optimal design of marketplaces with inequalities, this project aims to inform policymakers on how to introduce rules constraining transactions and distribute scarce resources without exacerbating inequalities."
