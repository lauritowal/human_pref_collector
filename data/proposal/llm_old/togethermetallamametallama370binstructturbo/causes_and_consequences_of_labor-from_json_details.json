        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility (LABFLEX)\n\nThe proposed project, LABFLEX, aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, a pressing issue in the face of globalization, technological change, and workplace transformation. The rise of outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs has sparked concerns about wage inequality and the division of resources in society. This project seeks to provide new evidence on the drivers and outcomes of labor market flexibility, with a focus on the organization of labor and its impact on workers and firms.\n\nThe objectives of LABFLEX are to examine the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, with a particular emphasis on the role of job contract differences, technology advances, and labor market institutions. The project will employ a multi-method approach, combining register data, experimental evidence on worker preferences, and analysis of full-text corpus of vacancies with job attribute information. This innovative approach will allow us to address key questions, including whether job contract differences reflect worker preferences or technology advances, and how labor market flexibility affects wage inequality, gender wage gaps, and the distribution of resources.\n\nThe expected outcomes of LABFLEX include a comprehensive understanding of the supply and demand sides of the labor market, shedding light on the complex relationships between labor market flexibility, worker preferences, and firm behavior. The project's findings will inform labor market policies and contribute to a more equitable distribution of resources in society. By providing new insights into the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, LABFLEX has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of the modern labor market.",
        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility (LABFLEX)\n\nThe LABFLEX project investigates the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of labor market flexibility, driven by globalization, technological change, and workplace transformation. The project aims to provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, with a focus on its impact on wage inequality, division of resources in society, and the organization of labor. Specifically, LABFLEX will explore the relationships between job contract flexibility, worker preferences, and technological advances, as well as the effects of labor market institutions and policies on flexibility.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, combining register data, experimental evidence, and full-text corpus analysis, LABFLEX will provide a comprehensive understanding of the supply and demand sides of the labor market. The project will address key questions, including whether job contract differences reflect worker preferences or technological advances, how flexibility affects wage inequality and gender wage gaps, and whether workers are compensated for adverse work conditions or higher income risks.\n\nThe expected outcomes of LABFLEX include new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, shedding light on the role of labor market institutions and policies in shaping flexibility. By providing a detailed picture of the labor market, LABFLEX will inform policy decisions and contribute to a more equitable distribution of resources in society. Ultimately, the project will enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics driving labor market flexibility and its implications for workers, firms, and society as a whole.",

The rise of outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs has led to concerns about wage inequality and the division of resources in society. This project seeks to provide new evidence on the drivers and outcomes of labor market flexibility, with a focus on the interplay between technological advancements, worker preferences, and labor market institutions.\n\nUsing a multi-method approach that combines register data, experimental evidence, and text analysis of job vacancies, LABFLEX will explore the following research questions: Do job contract differences reflect worker preferences or technology advances? What are the impacts of job contract flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers compensated for adverse work conditions or higher income risks? Do job contract changes reflect shifts in rent sharing between workers and firms? How do labor market institutions affect flexibility? What is the role of labor market policies?\n\nBy linking supply and demand sides of the labor market, LABFLEX will provide a comprehensive understanding of labor market flexibility, its causes, and its consequences. The project's outcomes will inform policy debates on labor market regulation, wage inequality, and the future of work, ultimately contributing to a more equitable distribution of resources in society."
