        "Here is a 286-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the development of parental caregiving in new parents, with a focus on both normal and disrupted development. The study will employ a multi-pronged approach, comprising three interconnected subprojects. Subproject 1 will conduct a longitudinal study of both women and men, beginning before pregnancy, to examine the structural and functional brain changes associated with the normal development of parental caregiving. Behavioral measures of caregiving tasks will also be assessed. Subproject 2 will employ a cross-sectional design to explore the effects of disrupted development of parental caregiving, specifically in the context of parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate. This subproject will examine the brain and behavioral effects on caregiving in these populations. Subproject 3 will utilize advanced computational models to synthesize the findings from the first two subprojects, with the goal of identifying the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. By elucidating the neural basis of parental caregiving, this study aims to inform the development of novel interventions to support new parents and promote healthy parent-child relationships. Ultimately, this research has the potential to improve outcomes for families and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.",
        "Here is a grant proposal abstract based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\nThis interdisciplinary project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the development of parental caregiving in new parents, with a focus on both normal and disrupted development. The proposed study consists of three subprojects. Subproject 1 will conduct a longitudinal investigation of brain changes associated with normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy and continuing through the postpartum period, in both women and men. This will involve the use of structural and functional neuroimaging, as well as behavioral measures of caregiving tasks. Subproject 2 will employ a cross-sectional design to examine the effects of disrupted development of parental caregiving, specifically in the context of parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate. Finally, Subproject 3 will utilize advanced computational models to synthesize the findings from Subprojects 1 and 2, with the goal of identifying fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. This project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the complex interplay between brain development, behavior, and environment in shaping parental caregiving, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions for at-risk families.",

We will employ structural and functional neuroimaging, as well as behavioral measures of caregiving tasks, to characterize the neural processes involved. In parallel, we will conduct a cross-sectional study of disrupted development of parental caregiving, examining the effects of parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality (cleft lip and palate) on brain and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we will use advanced computational models to synthesize our findings and identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting.
