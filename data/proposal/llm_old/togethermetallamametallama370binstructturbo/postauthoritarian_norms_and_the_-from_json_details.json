        "Here is a 210-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\n\nThis project investigates how the ideological associations of past authoritarian regimes shape political norms and competition in new democracies. Focusing on Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, we examine how voters and parties navigate the legacy of dictatorships, influencing their political positions and party competition. Through survey experiments, we will test a novel theory on the rejection of the ideological brand of past authoritarian regimes and its impact on the demand and supply sides of party competition. Our inquiry centers on three puzzles: the decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the higher likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. We will explore how citizens' avoidance of associations with past dictatorships' ideologies affects their preferences, perceptions of party stances, and national identity. Our expected output is a new theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies. This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between authoritarian legacies, political norms, and democratic consolidation, providing valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners alike.",
        "Title: Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\n\nThis project examines how the ideological legacy of past authoritarian regimes shapes political norms and party competition in new democracies. Focusing on Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, we investigate how voters and parties navigate the ideological associations of former dictatorships, influencing their political positions and party strategies. Through survey experiments, we aim to develop a new theory explaining the rejection of past authoritarian ideologies and its impact on political competition heterogeneity across new democracies. Our inquiry will explore the decline of left-wing parties, the emergence of radical right parties, and the likelihood of right-wing protests in these regions. By exploring issues such as voters' avoidance of ideological associations, party elite discourse, and national identity, we expect to produce a comprehensive theory that sheds light on the complex dynamics of political competition in post-authoritarian societies. The proposed project's expected output is a new theory explaining the heterogeneous political landscape of new democracies.",
        "Here is a 210-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\n\nThis project examines how the ideological associations of past authoritarian regimes shape norms in new democracies, influencing political positions among voters and parties. Focusing on Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, we investigate how the legacy of dictatorships affects political competition, particularly the decline of left-wing parties, the emergence of radical right parties, and the likelihood of right-wing protests. Through survey experiments, we will explore how voters avoid associating with the ideologies of past dictatorships, impacting the demand and supply sides of party competition. Our research will delve into citizens' ideological preferences, perceptions of party stances, national identity, and political discussions. We will also analyze the supply of new parties, post-transition party names, and programmatic stances, as well as party elite discourse. This project aims to develop a new theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies, shedding light on the complex interplay between authoritarian legacies and democratic politics."
