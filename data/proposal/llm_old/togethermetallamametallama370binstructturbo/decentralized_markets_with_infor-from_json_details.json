        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries\n\nThis project seeks to advance the theory of decentralized trade in the presence of informational asymmetries and limited commitment. In most trading situations, parties have unequal information, leading to market inefficiency. For instance, professional investors possess more information than individual investors in financial markets, and consumers have private information about their willingness to pay. The standard theory of mechanism design assumes strong commitment, which is often unrealistic, and existing literature focuses primarily on single-instance trading. This project aims to fill this gap by systematically analyzing decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries using game-theoretic tools.\n\nThe project's objectives are fourfold: (1) to understand the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, (2) to explore remedies for enhanced efficiency, (3) to contribute to the design of market institutions, and (4) to inform market regulation. The research will focus on repeated transactions in non-durable goods and services, as well as durable but divisible goods. By providing insights into the functioning of decentralized markets with informational asymmetries, this project will improve our understanding of market efficiency and inform regulatory policies to promote more efficient market outcomes. Ultimately, the project's findings will have significant implications for the design of market institutions and regulatory frameworks that facilitate efficient trade in a wide range of economic contexts.",

For instance, professional investors possess more information than individual investors in financial markets, while consumers have private information about their willingness to pay. Current literature on mechanism design assumes strong commitment, and existing studies often focus on single-instance trading, neglecting the repeated transactions that occur in many markets, such as those for non-durable goods and services and durable but divisible goods.\n\nThis project will employ a systematic game-theoretic analysis to investigate decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. The objectives are to understand the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, explore remedies for enhanced efficiency, contribute to market institution design, and inform market regulation. By examining the interactions between traders with unequal information, this project aims to provide insights into the design of trading mechanisms that can improve market efficiency and inform regulatory policies. The expected outcomes of this project will have significant implications for the development of more efficient and equitable markets, ultimately benefiting consumers and society as a whole.",

For instance, professional investors possess more information than individual investors in financial markets, and consumers have private information about their willingness to pay. Current mechanism design theory relies on strong commitment assumptions, and existing literature often focuses on single-instance trading, neglecting the repeated transactions that characterize many markets.\n\nThis project will conduct a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. The goal is to understand the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, explore remedies for enhanced efficiency, contribute to market institution design, and inform market regulation. By examining repeated transactions in non-durable goods and services, as well as durable but divisible goods, this research will provide insights into the design of trading mechanisms that can mitigate the negative effects of informational asymmetries and limited commitment.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the properties of decentralized markets, the identification of potential remedies for market inefficiencies, and contributions to the design of market institutions and regulations that promote efficiency and fairness. By addressing the limitations of current theory, this project will inform policy and regulatory decisions, ultimately leading to more efficient and equitable markets."
