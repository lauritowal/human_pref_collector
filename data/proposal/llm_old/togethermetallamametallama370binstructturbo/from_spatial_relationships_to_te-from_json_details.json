        "Here is a 295-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of gamma waves in the visual cortex, exploring their role in cortical communication, synaptic plasticity, and predictive coding. Focusing on the 30-80 Hz frequency range, we will investigate the encoding functions of gamma waves and their importance in integrating sensory information. Our research aims to shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders, where gamma wave dysfunction is implicated.\n\nWe will challenge the standard view that gamma waves solely carry prediction errors, instead proposing a new hypothesis: that long-range gamma synchronization enables distinct brain areas to predict each other's visual input. To test this, we will develop a novel method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, leveraging deep-learning networks, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG).\n\nOur experiments will involve both marmosets and humans, examining the impact of predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns on perceptual learning. We will also employ optogenetics to investigate whether gamma waves drive perceptual learning. Our expected outcome is evidence for a unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration, providing new insights into the neural basis of perception and cognition. Ultimately, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of brain function and inform novel therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric disorders.",
        "Here is a 295-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding\n\nThis proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of gamma waves in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, with a focus on their role in predictive coding within the visual cortex. Gamma waves, oscillating at 30-80 Hz, are crucial for information transmission and sensory evidence integration. We will investigate their encoding functions and explore their importance in predictive coding, a theory that posits that the brain is primarily a prediction machine. Our approach will integrate cutting-edge techniques, including deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We will conduct experiments in both marmosets and humans, examining the relationship between gamma wave synchronization patterns and predictability. \n\nOur novel hypothesis suggests that gamma waves signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, enabling long-range synchronization and the prediction of each other's visual input. We will develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, and utilize optogenetics to test gamma waves' driving of perceptual learning. Our expected outcomes include evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration, with anticipated implications for our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Ultimately, this project will provide a fundamental shift in our comprehension of brain function, with potential applications in the development of novel treatments for a range of brain disorders.",
