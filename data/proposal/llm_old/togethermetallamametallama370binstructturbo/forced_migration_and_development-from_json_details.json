        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Forced Migration and Development\n\nThe Forced Migration and Development (FORCEDMIGDEV) project seeks to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, where 85% of the world's 68.5 million displaced individuals are hosted. This research is crucial, as forced migration can have far-reaching and devastating effects on the economic well-being of both refugees and host communities.\n\nThe project consists of two interconnected parts. The first focuses on refugee inflows, developing a structural model to estimate the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks across regions, with a case study on Syrian refugees in Turkey. The second part examines the impact of climate shocks on internal displacement, combining reduced-form and structural methods to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement in Brazil.\n\nBy exploring the intersections of climate and development economics, FORCEDMIGDEV will provide critical insights into the economic consequences of forced migration, informing policy decisions that can mitigate its negative impacts and promote sustainable development. This project has the potential to shape the global response to forced migration, ensuring that both refugees and host communities can thrive in the face of crisis.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Forced Migration and Development\n\nThe Forced Migration and Development project (FORCEDMIGDEV) seeks to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, where 85% of displaced individuals (approximately 68.5 million people) are hosted. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks and internal displacement on host economies.\n\nThe project is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on refugee inflows, developing a structural model to estimate the economic consequences of refugee shocks. We will investigate the case of Syrian refugees in Turkey, addressing questions on the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare effects across regions, and the impact of legal status for refugees.\n\nThe second part examines the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement. We will combine reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the reduced-form effects in Brazil and develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement. This part of the project intersects with climate and development economics, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between climate change, migration, and economic development.\n\nBy shedding light on the economic consequences of forced migration, this project will inform policy decisions and contribute to the development of effective strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of forced migration on host economies.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Forced Migration and Development\n\nThe global forced migration crisis has reached unprecedented levels, with over 68.5 million displaced individuals, 85% of whom are hosted by developing countries. This project, FORCEDMIGDEV, aims to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, with a focus on two critical areas: refugee inflows and climate shocks on internal displacement.\n\nThe first part of the project will develop and estimate a structural model to investigate the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare effects across regions, and the impact of legal status for refugees, using the case of Syrian refugees in Turkey as a case study. The second part will combine reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement in Brazil, and develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement.\n\nBy addressing the intersections of climate and development economics, this project will provide critical insights into the economic consequences of forced migration, informing policy responses that can mitigate its negative impacts and promote more sustainable development outcomes. The project's findings will have important implications for developing countries hosting large refugee populations and those experiencing internal displacement due to climate shocks."
