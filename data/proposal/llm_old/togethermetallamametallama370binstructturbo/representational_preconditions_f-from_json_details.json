        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nThis project challenges traditional theories of understanding other minds, which posit that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late-developing. Instead, we propose that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in online cooperative social interactions. Recent evidence, including our own research findings, suggests that infants as young as 7 months old possess mechanisms for computing others' beliefs, even when not required. Our aim is to explore the empirical implications of this novel theoretical approach, investigating the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, and charting their developmental unfolding. We will also examine the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. By shifting the focus from effortful, late-developing processes to automatic, early-emerging mechanisms, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of social cognition and its role in human collaboration and social learning. Our research will employ a range of behavioral and neuroimaging methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions. The proposed project builds on our previous research and is informed by key findings in the field, including those of Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and Kovacs et al. (in press, Science).",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nThis project challenges traditional theories of understanding other minds, which posit that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late developing, primarily serving to explain others' behavior. In contrast, our novel theoretical approach suggests that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in online cooperative social interactions. Recent evidence showing infants understand mental states by the second year, as well as our own research findings, support this perspective. We have found that mechanisms for understanding other minds are present from as early as 7 months of age, and that infants and adults automatically compute others' beliefs even when not required.\n\nThe proposed project aims to explore the empirical implications of this new theoretical approach. Our research goals include: (1) exploring the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, (2) charting the developmental unfolding of these abilities, and (3) investigating the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. Using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods, we will investigate the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, focusing on automatic processes involved in social interactions. Our findings have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of social cognition and its development, with significant implications for fields such as education, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nThis proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying social mind functions, particularly the ability to infer and represent others' mental states. Contrary to traditional theories, which posit that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late-developing, our novel theoretical approach suggests that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in online cooperative social interactions. Recent findings, including our own research, have shown that infants as young as 7 months old possess mechanisms for computing others' beliefs, even when not required. These discoveries motivate a paradigm shift in our understanding of the functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds.\n\nThe proposed project aims to explore the empirical implications of this new theoretical perspective. Our research goals are threefold: (1) to investigate the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, (2) to chart the developmental unfolding of these abilities, and (3) to examine the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. By elucidating the automatic processes involved in social interactions, this project will provide new insights into the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying human collaboration and social learning. Our findings will have significant implications for our understanding of social cognition, its development, and its role in shaping human behavior."
