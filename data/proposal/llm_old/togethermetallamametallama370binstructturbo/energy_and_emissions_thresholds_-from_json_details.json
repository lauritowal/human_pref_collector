        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Energy and Emissions Thresholds for Providing Decent Living Standards to All\n\nThis project aims to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts required to provide decent living standards to all individuals globally. The research seeks to answer three key questions: What constitutes decent living standards? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services in different countries, and what is the resulting climate change impact? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? To achieve this, the project will operationalize basic needs views of human development, quantify energy needs and climate-related emissions for decent living constituents, and analyze path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity.\n\nThe project will employ lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling to investigate these questions in the context of five emerging economies. The research will consider the influence of cultural, climatic, technological, and other contextual factors on energy needs and emissions. The objectives of this project are to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts of energy use, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. The project's findings will contribute to a better understanding of the energy and emissions thresholds required to provide decent living standards to all, ultimately informing policy and decision-making towards a more sustainable and equitable future.",

We will operationalize basic needs views of human development, advancing empirical validity by discerning characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. Using lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling, we will quantify energy needs and climate-related emissions for decent living constituents in five emerging economies, considering factors such as culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions. Our research will address three key questions: What constitutes decent living standards? What energy resources are required to provide these goods and services, and what is the resulting climate change impact? How do the constituents of decent living and their energy needs evolve as countries develop? The project's objectives are to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts of energy use, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the energy-emissions nexus in the context of decent living standards, this project will contribute to the development of sustainable and equitable solutions for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.",

Our research will focus on five emerging economies, considering the contextual factors of culture, climate, technology, and other conditions.\n\nThe project consists of three tasks. First, we will operationalize basic needs views of human development and advance empirical validity by analyzing household consumption patterns. Second, we will quantify energy needs and climate-related emissions for decent living constituents using lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling. Third, we will analyze path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity using empirical analysis.\n\nOur objectives are to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts of energy use, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. By achieving these objectives, this project will provide critical insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working towards sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Our findings will help ensure that all individuals have access to decent living standards while minimizing the environmental impacts of energy use."
