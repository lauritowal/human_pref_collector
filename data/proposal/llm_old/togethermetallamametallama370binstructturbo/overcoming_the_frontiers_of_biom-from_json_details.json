        "Here is a 265-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Overcoming the Frontiers of Biomolecular Studies on Human History and Adaptation using Palaeoproteomics (BACKWARD)\n\nThis project proposes a revolutionary approach to understanding human history and adaptation by developing and applying cutting-edge palaeoproteomic workflows. The BACKWARD project aims to address the phylogenetic relationships among African and Asian extinct hominids, extend molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA (aDNA) limits, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of species extinct millions of years ago. By combining advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions, we will sequence ancient proteins and reconstruct the evolutionary history of extinct species.\n\nThe project's objectives are twofold: to develop a new generation of palaeoproteomic workflows and to deploy advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions. Our targets include the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. The proposed research has significant applications, including identifying and correlating processes of human brain expansion and reorganization, and species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments.\n\nThis collaborative effort among participating institutions will have a transformative impact on the field, akin to the discovery of aDNA over the past two decades. Furthermore, the project's commercial repurposing potential is vast, with applications in diagnostics in forensic medicine, the food industry, and pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, the BACKWARD project will push the boundaries of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation, providing new insights into our shared evolutionary past.",

The BACKWARD project aims to address the phylogeny of African and Asian extinct hominids, extend molecular-based phylogeny beyond the limits of ancient DNA (aDNA), and reconstruct the evolutionary history of species that went extinct millions of years ago. To achieve these objectives, we will deploy advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions, leveraging the power of palaeoproteomics and MS-based ancient protein sequencing.\n\nOur targets include elucidating phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. The applications of this research are far-reaching, with potential to identify and correlate processes of human brain expansion and reorganization, and enable species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Furthermore, the outcomes of this project are expected to have transformative commercial implications, including diagnostics in forensic medicine, food industry, and pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThis collaborative effort among participating institutions will have a lasting legacy, akin to the impact of aDNA over the past two decades. By pushing the boundaries of palaeoproteomics, we will uncover new insights into human history and adaptation, and open up new avenues for interdisciplinary research.",

By deploying advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions, we will address the phylogeny of African and Asian extinct hominids, extend molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA (aDNA) limits, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of species extinct millions of years ago. Our project will focus on two key targets: the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. The proposed research will have significant applications in identifying and correlating processes of human brain expansion and reorganization, as well as species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Moreover, the developed technologies will have commercial repurposing potential in diagnostics, food, and pharmaceutical industries.
