        "Here is a 295-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\n\nThis innovative project pioneers a comprehensive approach to understanding the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' culture, exploring how ancient myths and legends are reshaped in response to regional and global challenges. Current research has selectively focused on Western culture, overlooking the diverse ways Classical Antiquity is received and reinterpreted across different regions. This project addresses this limitation by applying regional perspectives without pejorative implications and conducting comparative studies of reception models across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia.\n\nAn international team of scholars will collaborate to investigate how popular culture influences the reception of Classical Antiquity, leading to a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations. The project's expected outcomes include a supra-regional survey of classical references, in-depth analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for use with disabled children. By exploring the shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, this project aims to contribute to integration and stimulate cultural exchange. Its broad impact will be felt in scholarship, education, and culture, offering insights into identity formation and initiation into adulthood. Ultimately, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of how Classical Antiquity continues to shape our collective imagination and inform our responses to regional and global challenges.",

By moving beyond the selective focus on Western culture, our international team of scholars will conduct comparative studies across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia, applying regional perspectives without pejorative implications.\n\nOur research will offer crucial insights into identity formation and initiation into adulthood, examining how the reception of Antiquity influences popular culture and vice versa. We will develop a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyze pivotal reception cases, and create materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. Our project aims to contribute to integration and stimulate cultural exchange, fostering a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project will have a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics between Classical Antiquity and modern children's and young adults' culture. By exploring the shared heritage of ancient myths and legends, we will shed light on the ways in which regional and global challenges shape our understanding of the past and inform our collective future.",
