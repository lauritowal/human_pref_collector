        "Here is a 267-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES)\n\nThe SHARES project tackles the pressing issue of allocating responsibilities in international cooperative actions, where the involvement of multiple actors can lead to dilution of responsibility and undermine the rule of law. The project's primary objectives are to rethink the allocation of international responsibilities, address the problem of responsibility dilution, ensure the protection of the international rule of law, and provide remedies for injured parties.\n\nThe SHARES project will overcome the challenges of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility. Our approach involves uncovering the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and developing new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility.\n\nThe project will focus on two key areas: the principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, and the processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies. Our methodology combines a conceptual and theoretical foundation with an empirical approach through case-studies.\n\nBy exploring the problem of scattered responsibilities and providing solutions for better matching international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility, SHARES aims to ensure that international cooperation is effective, accountable, and just. The project's outcomes will have significant implications for the development of international law and the promotion of global governance.",
        "Here is a 267-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES)\n\nThe Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES) project addresses a critical gap in international cooperation: the scattering of responsibilities among multiple actors, leading to dilution of accountability and undermining of key objectives. This project aims to rethink the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions, ensuring protection of the international rule of law and providing remedies for injured parties.\n\nSHARES will uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and develop new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility. The project focuses on two key areas: principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, and processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies.\n\nUsing a conceptual and theoretical foundation, combined with an empirical approach through case-studies, SHARES will explore the complexities of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and identify solutions to prevent the undermining of key objectives. The project's outcomes will provide a framework for better matching international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility, ultimately strengthening the international rule of law and protecting the rights of injured parties.",
        "Here is a 267-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES)\n\nThe SHARES project addresses the pressing issue of responsibility dilution in international cooperation, where the allocation of responsibilities among multiple actors undermines the protection of the international rule of law and leaves injured parties without remedies. The project's objectives are to rethink the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions, ensure the protection of the international rule of law, and provide remedies for injured parties within shared responsibilities.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and develop new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility. The project's focus areas include the principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible and the processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies.\n\nUsing a conceptual and theoretical foundation, combined with an empirical approach through case studies, the project will explore the challenges of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility. The expected outcomes of the project include a better understanding of shared responsibility in international law and practical solutions for improving the allocation of responsibilities in cooperative actions."
