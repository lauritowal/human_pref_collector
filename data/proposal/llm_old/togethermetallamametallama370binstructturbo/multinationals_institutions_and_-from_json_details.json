        "Here is a 264-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the location strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their territorial impacts in Europe. With MNEs contributing over a quarter of global GDP, valued at US$16 trillion, their role in shaping regional economic development is significant. The increasing prominence of MNEs from developing economies, which accounted for 31% of global outward FDI flows in 2012, up from 16% in 2007, underscores the need to understand their investment decisions and implications for host regions.\n\nDespite their importance, existing research has neglected the territorial impacts of MNEs, particularly in the European context. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the location strategies of MNEs in Europe, including the role of institutional factors in shaping their investment decisions. The research will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which MNEs influence regional innovation systems and economic development.\n\nThe project's outcomes will inform policy-making at the European and national levels, providing tools for policymakers to design effective strategies to attract and retain MNE investment, promote innovation, and foster sustainable economic growth. By shedding light on the complex relationships between MNEs, institutions, and innovation in Europe, this project will contribute to the development of more effective policies to support economic development and competitiveness in the region.",
        "Here is a 264-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe\n\nMultinational enterprises (MNEs) play a vital role in the global economy, accounting for over a quarter of the world's GDP, with a total value added of US$16 trillion. In recent years, there has been a significant shift in foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows, with developing economies increasingly becoming important sources of outward investment. In 2012, FDI outflows from developing economies reached $426 billion, accounting for 31% of global outflows, up from 16% in 2007. Despite their significance, there is a lack of understanding of the location strategies of MNEs and their impacts on the territories in which they operate.\n\nThis project aims to investigate the location strategies of MNEs and their territorial impacts, addressing gaps in the existing literature. The research will provide policymakers with tools to design effective policies that maximize the benefits of MNEs while minimizing their negative impacts. By examining the complex relationships between MNEs, institutions, and innovation in Europe, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of MNEs in shaping regional economic development. The project's findings will have important implications for policy and practice, informing strategies to promote sustainable economic growth and development in Europe.",

In recent years, foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows from developing economies have surged, reaching $426 billion in 2012, with a significant increase in their share of global outflows from 16% in 2007 to 31% in 2012.

By examining the complex relationships between MNEs, institutions, and innovation, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of the factors driving MNEs' location choices and their effects on local economies. The project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of FDI data with case studies of MNEs in Europe. The expected outcomes of this project include the development of policy-making tools and recommendations for European policymakers to foster innovation, promote sustainable economic growth, and maximize the benefits of MNEs' activities. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the role of MNEs in shaping the European economy and inform strategies to enhance their positive impacts on local communities."
