        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases, and the Postwar Government of Health\n\nThis socio-historical project examines the transformative shift in health governance from the post-World War II era to the 1980s, when international public health gave way to global health. Focusing on tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics, we will investigate the changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO) and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. Through historical and anthropological approaches, we will analyze the emergence of a new regime of knowledge and action characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public alliances.\n\nOur research will explore the inclusion of diverse social worlds, such as laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations, to understand how global health is translated and emerges from local practices and knowledge. We will also examine the circulation of knowledge and practices beyond North-South transfers, shedding light on the complexities of global health in a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty.\n\nBy understanding this transition, our project aims to provide a nuanced perspective on the evolution of global health governance, highlighting the interplay between local and global forces, and the implications for health policy and practice. Our research will contribute to a more informed and inclusive approach to global health, recognizing the diversity of knowledge systems and practices that shape health outcomes worldwide.",
        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health\n\nThis socio-historical project examines the transformative shift in health governance from the post-World War II era to the present day. Focusing on the 1980s as a pivotal moment, our research explores the transition from an international public health paradigm centered on eradication and United Nations organizations to a global health regime characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public alliances.\n\nThrough a combination of historical and anthropological approaches, we will investigate four key areas: tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics. Our study will highlight the changing roles of the World Health Organization and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. By analyzing the social worlds of laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations, we will reveal how global health is translated and emerges from local practices and knowledge.\n\nThis project's expected benefits include a nuanced understanding of the transition from the Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty. We will explore different levels of circulation beyond North-South transfers, providing a more comprehensive grasp of the complexities shaping global health today. Ultimately, our research aims to contribute to a more inclusive and effective approach to global health governance, one that acknowledges the diversity of local practices and knowledge systems.",
        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases, and the Postwar Government of Health\n\nThis socio-historical research project investigates the transformation of health governance from the post-World War II era to the present day, marked by a shift from international public health to global health. Focusing on tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics, we will conduct historical and anthropological inquiries to understand the changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO) and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. Our study will explore how global health has been translated and emerges from local practices and knowledge, moving beyond North-South transfers to examine different levels of circulation. By analyzing the transition from the Cold War era to the current neo-liberal and multi-centric age, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the evolution of health governance. The project's expected benefits include the inclusion of diverse social worlds, a localized approach to global health, and a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping health policy and practice. By illuminating the historical and cultural context of global health, this project will inform more effective and equitable health interventions in the 21st century."
