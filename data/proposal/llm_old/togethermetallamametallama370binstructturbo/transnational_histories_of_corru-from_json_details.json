        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\nThe TransCorr project seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of \"corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe between 1750 and 1850, a period marked by the rise of modernity and Great Power interventions. This research will examine how the notion of corruption evolved, was reframed, and was used to justify various claims, including more honest and efficient administrations, effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations. By analyzing the assessments of foreign observers and indigenous critics, this project will uncover the complex motivations behind these claims, including political, professional, and personal interests.\n\nThrough a nuanced exploration of the linkages between corruption and cultural backwardness, economic under-development, and center-periphery relations, this project will challenge prevailing narratives on modernization and development. By tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption, TransCorr will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical roots of contemporary debates on patronage, graft, and good governance. This research will engage in a dialogue with global modernization theories, align historiography with scientific innovations, and reframe debates on patronage and graft. Ultimately, TransCorr aims to reconfigure our understanding of center-periphery relations and provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of corruption in Central-South-East Europe during this pivotal period.",
        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Transnational Histories of \"Corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\nThis project, TransCorr, seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of \"corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe between 1750 and 1850. By examining the evolution of corruption as a political and social construct, we will demonstrate how it was reframed as a cultural and economic problem, linked to notions of \"cultural backwardness\" and \"economic under-development.\" Our research will analyze the assessments of corruption by foreign observers and indigenous critics, motivated by political, professional, and personal interests. We will investigate how claims of more honest and efficient administrations, effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations were used to justify interventions and shape public opinion.\n\nThrough a rigorous historical analysis, we aim to achieve four primary goals: construct a history of the idea of corruption, demonstrate the reframing of customs as corrupt, examine the impacts of Great Power interventions, and trace the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption. This project will make a significant academic contribution by engaging in dialogue with global modernization theories, aligning historiography with scientific innovations, reframing debates on patronage and graft, and reconfiguring our understanding of center-periphery relations. By exploring the transnational histories of corruption, we will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between power, culture, and economy in Central-South-East Europe during this critical period of modernization.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Transnational Histories of \"Corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\nThis project, TransCorr, seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of \"corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe during the transformative period of 1750-1850. By examining the intersecting themes of political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, we will demonstrate how foreign observers and indigenous critics framed and reframed customs as corrupt, leading to claims of more honest and efficient administrations, effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations. Our research will explore the motivations behind these claims, including political, professional, and personal factors, and their linkages to cultural backwardness and economic under-development. Through a meticulous analysis of primary sources, we aim to achieve four key goals: construct a history of the idea of \"corruption,\" demonstrate the reframing of customs as corrupt, examine the impacts of Great Power interventions, and trace the genealogy of ideas and attitudes. By doing so, TransCorr will make significant academic contributions to the dialogue with global modernization, align historiography with scientific innovations, reframe debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigure our understanding of center-periphery relations. Ultimately, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of \"corruption\" in Central-South-East Europe during this pivotal period."
