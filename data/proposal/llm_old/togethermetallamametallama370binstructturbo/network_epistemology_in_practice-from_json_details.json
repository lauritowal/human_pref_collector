        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Network Epistemology in Practice: Understanding Collective Knowledge Generation at CERN\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the epistemology of large-scale scientific collaborations, focusing on particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). By analyzing internal communication documents, including emails and wiki pages, we aim to understand how knowledge is generated and validated in these complex research environments. Our objectives include characterizing collective research processes, reconstructing internal communication networks, and developing historiographic guidelines for future studies. We will adapt theoretical models of network epistemology to inform our analysis and contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation. Methodologically, we will innovate by applying digital tools and computational methods to the study of born-digital sources. The project's outcomes will include practical strategies for best practices in history and philosophy of science, as well as historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources. By shedding light on the epistemology of large-scale scientific collaborations, this project will address a critical challenge in the history and philosophy of science, with implications for our understanding of collective knowledge generation and validation.",

By leveraging digital humanities tools and computational methods, we will analyze internal communication data, including emails and wiki pages, to reconstruct the collective research processes underlying particle physics discoveries. Our objectives are to understand how knowledge is generated and validated in these collaborations, develop historiographic guidelines for future studies, and contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation. We will adapt theoretical models of network epistemology to the CERN context, providing new insights into the complex dynamics of scientific inquiry. The project's innovative methodology will yield practical strategies for best practices in history and philosophy of science, as well as historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources. By addressing the challenge of capturing large-scale, complex research processes for epistemological analysis, this project will advance our understanding of how scientific knowledge is created and validated in the 21st century."
