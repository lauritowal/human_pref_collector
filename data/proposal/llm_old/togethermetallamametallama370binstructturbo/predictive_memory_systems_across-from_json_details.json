        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan\n\nThe Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan (PIVOTAL) project seeks to advance our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying predictive processing in relation to memory across the human lifespan. Building on the predictive coding framework, this project will investigate the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, as well as the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation and senescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs, we will integrate predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research to examine the role of predictive processing in episodic and semantic memory. Our study will recruit children, younger adults, and older adults to explore how predictive memory systems develop, progress, and conserve across the lifespan. By examining the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits, we aim to provide a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle, shedding light on the emergence of disorders in different life stages. The proposed research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human memory and its development, with significant implications for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of memory-related disorders.",

Building on the predictive coding framework, this project will investigate how internal models and future state predictions influence memory systems, with a focus on episodic and semantic memory. We will examine how brain diversity, resulting from maturation and senescence, affects predictive processing and memory performance in children, younger adults, and older adults. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs, we will integrate predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research to achieve our research aims. By exploring the progression and conservation of predictive memory systems across the lifespan, we expect to provide a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle and shed light on the emergence of disorders in different life stages. Ultimately, PIVOTAL aims to contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory of human memory and its neural underpinnings, with significant implications for improving cognitive health across the lifespan.",
