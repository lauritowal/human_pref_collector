        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Managing Performative Science (MAPS)\n\nThe Managing Performative Science (MAPS) project seeks to address a critical gap in our understanding of the performative nature of scientific inquiry. Performativity in science refers to the phenomenon where scientific predictions and explanations influence the very outcomes they aim to predict or explain. This project will develop a novel understanding of performativity, assess its ethical risks, and provide orientation for assessing and managing performative science.\n\nFocusing on the fields of economics, epidemiology, and machine learning, MAPS will explore the implications of performativity on scientific knowledge production and its potential consequences for society. By examining the intersections of performativity, scientific prediction and explanation, and ethical questions in science, this project will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing performative science.\n\nThe MAPS project aims to provide philosophical guidance on performative science, filling a lacuna in current scholarship. By doing so, it will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between science, society, and ethics. Ultimately, MAPS will offer a roadmap for scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by performative science, ensuring that scientific knowledge is produced and used in a responsible and ethical manner.",
        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Managing Performative Science (MAPS)\n\nThe Managing Performative Science (MAPS) project addresses a critical gap in our understanding of the performative nature of scientific inquiry, particularly in fields such as economics, epidemiology, and machine learning. Performativity refers to the phenomenon where scientific theories and models shape the very reality they seek to describe, often with unintended consequences. Despite its significance, performativity remains understudied, leaving policymakers and scientists without a clear framework for navigating its implications.\n\nMAPS aims to develop a novel understanding of performativity, assessing its ethical risks and providing orientation for the assessment and management of performative science. By integrating insights from philosophy of science, ethics, and scientific practice, this project will illuminate the complex relationships between scientific prediction, explanation, and reality. Our research will focus on three key objectives: (1) developing a nuanced understanding of performativity in science, (2) evaluating the ethical risks associated with performative science, and (3) providing practical guidance for scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to manage performativity in their work.\n\nBy closing the lacuna in philosophical guidance on performative science, MAPS will contribute to a more informed and responsible approach to scientific inquiry, ultimately fostering more effective and ethical science-based decision-making. Our project's interdisciplinary approach and real-world focus ensure that its findings will have a tangible impact on the scientific community and beyond.",

By examining the ways in which scientific models and predictions shape reality, we will develop a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing performativity in science.
