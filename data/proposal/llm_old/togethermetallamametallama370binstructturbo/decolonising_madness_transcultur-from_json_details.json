        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order, and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\n\nThis project proposes a historical and interdisciplinary analysis of the origins and development of transcultural psychiatry and the global psyche concept. Focusing on the period following World War II and during decolonization, the project aims to investigate the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health and illness notions, analyze the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, and provide a systematic account of the decolonization of psychiatry and mental health sciences. Through an inter-disciplinary approach, this project seeks to answer key research questions, including how culture, race, and individual psyche were re-defined post-WWII and post-colonialism, and what role experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe played in this process. The expected outcomes include the definition of universal psychological mechanisms, an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and new cross-cultural models of the mind. By exploring the decolonization of psychiatry and mental health sciences, this project aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the global psyche and promote a more inclusive and equitable mental health discourse.",
        "Here is a 282-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order, and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\n\nThis project seeks to provide a historical and interdisciplinary analysis of the origins and development of transcultural psychiatry and the concept of a global psyche in the aftermath of World War II and during the decolonization era. By investigating the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health and illness notions, this project aims to uncover the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement and provide a systematic account of the decolonization of psychiatry and mental health sciences.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach, combining historical analysis with insights from psychiatry, anthropology, and sociology, this project will explore how culture, race, and individual psyche were re-defined in the post-war and post-colonial periods. It will examine the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in shaping the new global and transcultural psychiatry, and whether this movement departed from colonial frameworks.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the definition of universal psychological mechanisms, an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and new cross-cultural models of the mind. By fostering a dialogue between diverse mental health communities, this project aims to contribute to a more inclusive and culturally sensitive understanding of mental health and illness, ultimately informing the development of more effective and culturally responsive mental health practices.",
        "Here is a 282-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order, and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\n\nThis project undertakes a historical and inter-disciplinary analysis of the origins and development of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry concepts in the aftermath of World War II and during the decolonisation era. The project's objectives are threefold: to investigate the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health and illness notions, to analyze the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, and to provide a systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. Through an inter-disciplinary approach that combines historical analysis with insights from psychiatry, anthropology, and sociology, this project aims to redefine the global psyche and transcultural psychiatry by foregrounding the perspectives of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include the definition of universal psychological mechanisms, an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and new cross-cultural models of the mind. By exploring research questions such as how culture, race, and individual psyche were re-defined post-WWII and post-colonialism, and whether the new global and transcultural psychiatry departed from colonial frameworks, this project seeks to ignite a critical discourse between Western and non-Western mental health communities, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and decolonised understanding of mental health and illness."
