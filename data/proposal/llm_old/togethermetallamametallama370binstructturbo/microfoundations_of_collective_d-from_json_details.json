        "Here is a 288-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Microfoundations of Collective Defence\n\nThe Microfoundations of Collective Defence project seeks to initiate a new research agenda on the fundamental building blocks of collective defence, shedding light on the views of individuals that shape public opinion and inform policy decisions in NATO member states. By integrating experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology approaches, this project will investigate how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios, how these attitudes aggregate to form public opinion, and how public opinion influences decision-makers in allied states.\n\nOur research will test three key hypotheses: that strategic context impacts the formation of public opinion, that conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limit the role of public opinion, and that ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making. To achieve this, we will develop novel immersive mixed-media experiments that provide an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for participants.\n\nThe project's findings have significant policy implications, as they could redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances. By understanding the microfoundations of collective defence, policymakers can better navigate the complexities of alliance politics and make more informed decisions about when and how to provide allied assistance. This research has the potential to inform NATO's strategic decision-making and contribute to a more stable and secure international environment.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Microfoundations of Collective Defence\n\nThis project aims to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence, investigating how individual attitudes towards allied assistance shape public opinion and influence decision-makers in key NATO member states. By combining experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology approaches, this study will examine how strategic context, scenario ambiguity, and other factors impact the formation of public opinion and its role in policy-making. The project's innovative methodology features immersive, mixed-media experiments that provide an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for participants. The research will test three core hypotheses: that strategic context impacts public opinion formation, that conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limit the role of public opinion, and that ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making. The findings of this project have significant policy implications, with the potential to redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances. By shedding light on the microfoundations of collective defence, this research can inform more effective alliance management and decision-making in an increasingly complex security environment.",
        "Here is a grant proposal abstract based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: Microfoundations of Collective Defence\n\nThis project seeks to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence, investigating how individual attitudes shape public opinion and influence decision-makers in allied states. Through an extensive, cross-national study in key NATO member states, we will employ cutting-edge experimental political science approaches, combining insights from international relations and political psychology. Our unit of analysis is the views of individuals, which we will examine using a novel theoretical model comprising attitude formation, aggregation, and influence on policy-making. We hypothesize that strategic context impacts public opinion, conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limit public opinion's role, and ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making. To test these hypotheses, we will design novel immersive mixed-media experiments that provide an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience for participants. The findings of this project could redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances, informing policy decisions and ultimately enhancing collective defence."
