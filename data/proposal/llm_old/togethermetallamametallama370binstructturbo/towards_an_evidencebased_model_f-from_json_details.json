        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Towards an Evidence-Based Model for Big Data Policing: Evaluating Statistical-Methodological, Criminological, and Legal and Ethical Conditions\n\nBig data policing, which leverages historical data to predict high-risk crime locations and optimize police resource deployment, has the potential to significantly reduce crime rates. However, the current state of big data policing in Europe is characterized by fragmented expertise, a lack of interdisciplinarity, and insufficient scientific evaluations of these models. This project aims to address these knowledge gaps by developing an evidence-based model for big data policing that integrates statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions.\n\nOur approach is innovative in its focus on transparency regarding predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and legal and ethical standards, distinguishing it from commercial and economic initiatives. We will achieve our objective through a mixed-methods design, combining statistical analysis of key variables (such as previous crime events, poverty index, and police patrol intensity) with criminological, legal, and ethical expertise. The model will be tested through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles.\n\nThe project will support four PhD tracks, each focusing on a different dimension of the model: statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical. By developing an evidence-based model for big data policing, this project has the potential to inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to more effective and responsible crime prevention strategies in Europe.",

We will achieve this objective by bringing together experts from four Ph.D. tracks: statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical. Through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles, we will test the model and evaluate its effectiveness in reducing crime rates.\n\nThe proposed model will be informed by a range of variables, including previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity. By developing a robust, evidence-based model for big data policing, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on crime prevention and community safety in Europe.",

The proposed model will be grounded in scientific rigor, transparency, and accountability, ensuring that big data policing is deployed in a way that respects individual rights and promotes community trust. Ultimately, our project aims to contribute to a safer and more just society by harnessing the potential of big data policing while minimizing its risks."
