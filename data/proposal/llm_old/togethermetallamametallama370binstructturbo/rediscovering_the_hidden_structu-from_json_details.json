        "Here is a 329-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\n\nThis project seeks to rewrite the history of Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity by uncovering the hidden structures that underpinned the transmission and development of legal thought during this period. Through a comprehensive analysis of manuscript transmission, imperial legislation, and the role of classical jurists, our research team will provide a new understanding of the persistence of a high-level legal culture in Late Antiquity.\n\nOur interdisciplinary team of three research teams will employ a multifaceted approach, combining philological, historical, and legal expertise to examine the complex relationships between juristic texts, imperial legislation, and the cultural context in which they evolved. We will focus on the manuscript transmission of legal texts, the motivations behind emperors' legislation, and the role of classical jurists in shaping legal thought.\n\nThe project's activities will include the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, workshops with European scholars, and a final international conference on legal culture. Our outputs will comprise a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission, shedding new light on the patterns of thought and intellectual traditions that shaped the development of law in this period. By doing so, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the roots of Western legal tradition and its ongoing relevance in modern societies.",

Our interdisciplinary team of three research teams will investigate the persistence of a high-level legal culture during this period, focusing on the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations. By examining the relationship between the works of Roman jurists and the role of classical jurists, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission.\n\nThe project's activities will include the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, workshops with European scholars, and a final international conference on legal culture.

The project's cross-disciplinary approach will bring together scholars from law, classics, history, and philology, ensuring a rich and nuanced understanding of this complex period.

Our research will focus on two key areas: the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations. By examining the persistence of a high-level legal culture, the role of classical jurists, and the relationship between their works, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission.\n\nTo achieve this aim, our three research teams will engage in a range of activities, including the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, workshops with European scholars, and a final international conference on legal culture. Our expected outputs include a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference.
