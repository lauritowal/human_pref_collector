        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wrap It Up: Deciphering experience-dependent myelin growth across development\n\nThe WRAPPED project aims to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory by assessing changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. Using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data, we will probe the entire developmental lifespan to understand how myelin levels in the living human brain change over time and between individuals. Our study will focus on critical periods of learning, including when infants learn to crawl, children enter school, and young adults and older adults acquire novel skills such as juggling and reading Chinese.\n\nBy establishing a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, our project will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be employed to non-invasively measure myelin growth in the brain.\n\nThe WRAPPED project has two primary objectives: (1) to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory, and (2) to establish a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin. By achieving these objectives, our project will provide a foundational understanding of experience-dependent myelin growth and its impact on human development and disease.",

Using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data, we will probe the entire developmental lifespan to understand how myelin growth contributes to learning and development. Specifically, we will evaluate changes in myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals, focusing on critical periods such as when infants learn to crawl, children enter school, and young adults and older adults acquire novel skills like juggling and reading Chinese.\n\nThis project's objectives are twofold. First, we will elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory, providing a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin. Second, we will establish a comprehensive understanding of myelin growth and its relationship to learning, which will inform strategies for early intervention and treatment of disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will utilize advanced MRI techniques to non-invasively measure myelin levels in the brain. By deciphering the complex relationship between myelin growth and learning, WRAPPED has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human development and inform novel therapeutic approaches for disorders affecting millions worldwide.",

Using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data, we will probe the entire developmental lifespan to understand how myelin growth is shaped by experience. Specifically, we will evaluate changes in myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals as infants learn to crawl, children enter school, and young adults and older adults acquire novel skills such as juggling and reading Chinese. \n\nThe objectives of this project are to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory and establish a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, including schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. By leveraging advanced MRI technology, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of experience-dependent myelin growth and its relationship to learning and brain development. The findings of this project will have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for disorders characterized by aberrant myelin growth and will provide critical insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human learning and cognition."
