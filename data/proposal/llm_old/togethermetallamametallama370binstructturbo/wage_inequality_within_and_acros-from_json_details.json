        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wage Inequality within and across Firms: The Role of Market Forces, Government and Firm Policies\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the factors contributing to wage inequality within and across firms in industrialized countries, with a particular focus on persistent gender gaps. Over the past decades, wage inequality has increased between firms, and gender gaps remain significant. This project aims to disentangle the roles of market forces, government policies, and firm policies in driving these trends.\n\nUsing a unique combination of German social security records, survey data, and administrative data covering four decades, we will conduct three interconnected projects. Project A will examine the impact of market forces, including product market competition and routine-biased technological change, on wage inequality. Project B will analyze the effects of government policies, such as minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes, on firm-level wage inequality. Project C will investigate how firm policies, including family-friendly policies and flexible working times, influence mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth, and how these outcomes are affected by firm environment factors, such as the presence of co-workers with working mothers and egalitarian gender attitudes.\n\nBy exploring the interplay between market forces, government policies, and firm policies, this project will provide new insights into the drivers of wage inequality and inform policy interventions to reduce gender gaps. The project's findings will have significant implications for policymakers, firms, and individuals seeking to promote greater equality in the labor market.",

Over the past decades, wage inequality has increased between firms, and gender gaps have persisted. This project aims to disentangle the role of market forces, government policies, and firm policies in shaping these trends.\n\nUsing a rich dataset combining German social security records, survey data, and administrative data covering four decades, this project consists of three interconnected sub-projects. Project A examines the impact of market forces, such as product market competition and routine-biased technological change, on wage inequality. Project B analyzes the effects of government policies, including minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes, on firm-level wage inequality. Project C investigates the role of firm policies, such as family-friendly policies and flexible working times, on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.\n\nBy exploring the interplay between these factors, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving wage inequality within and across firms. The findings of this research will inform policy interventions aimed at reducing wage inequality and promoting greater gender equality in the labor market. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable economic growth.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wage Inequality within and across Firms: The Role of Market Forces, Government, and Firm Policies\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the complex factors contributing to wage inequality within and across firms in industrialized countries over the past decades. Despite considerable research, wage inequality remains a pressing issue, with persistent gender gaps and increasing disparities between firms. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of market forces, government policies, and firm policies in shaping wage inequality, with a particular focus on gender inequality.\n\nUsing a unique combination of German social security records, survey data, and administrative data covering four decades, we will examine three interconnected projects.

Project C will explore the effects of firm policies, such as family-friendly policies and flexible working times, on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.\n\nBy disentangling the mechanisms underlying wage inequality, our project will provide valuable insights for policymakers and firms seeking to reduce gender gaps and promote more equitable labor market outcomes. Our findings will inform the development of targeted policies and practices that can help mitigate wage inequality and promote a more inclusive and productive workforce."
