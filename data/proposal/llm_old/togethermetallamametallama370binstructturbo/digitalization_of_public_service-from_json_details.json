        "Here is a 261-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development\n\nEvery year, an estimated 5.7 million deaths and 100 million cases of poverty are attributed to inadequate access to public services (Lancet Health Commission, 2018). In response, governments globally are adopting digital technologies to improve service delivery. While high-income countries have made impressive strides, low-income countries face significant challenges, with one-third of digitalization projects abandoned (World Development Report, 2016). A critical risk of digitization projects is excluding individuals with limited connectivity.\n\nThis research aims to investigate the determinants of success or failure of digitalization projects and identify strategies to improve efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery. We will collaborate with local governments and NGOs to conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Our study will focus on the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring.\n\nThe outcome goal of this project is to increase access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment. Our findings will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately reducing mortality and poverty rates. By understanding what works and what doesn't in digitalization projects, we can ensure that the benefits of digital technologies are shared equitably, leaving no one behind.",

Despite the global government response to adopt digital technologies, one-third of digitalization projects in low-income countries are abandoned (World Development Report, 2016). This issue is critical, as an estimated 5.7 million deaths and 100 million cases of poverty are attributed to limited access to public services annually (Lancet Health Commission, 2018).\n\nThis project will conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, in collaboration with local governments and NGOs. The study will examine the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. By understanding the factors that influence the success of digitalization projects, we can inform public policy in low-income countries and ultimately increase access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment.\n\nThe project's outcome goal is to improve the lives of millions of individuals who currently lack access to essential public services. By addressing the risks of digitization projects, which often exclude individuals with limited connectivity, this project can contribute to more inclusive and sustainable development outcomes. The findings of this project will have significant policy implications, enabling governments and stakeholders to make informed decisions about digitalization initiatives and ensuring that no one is left behind.",

Despite the global government response to adopt digital technologies, one-third of digitalization projects in low-income countries are abandoned, excluding individuals with limited connectivity. This project seeks to address this challenge through a mixed-methods approach, combining experiments and qualitative research in four countries: India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n\nThe study will focus on two key areas: demand for public services via digital access and supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. Through four experiments, we will examine the impact of digitalization on access to public services, particularly for marginalized populations. Our research will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately aiming to increase access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment.\n\nBy collaborating with local governments and NGOs, we will ensure that our research is grounded in local contexts and informs practical solutions. The Lancet Health Commission (2018) estimates that 5.7 million deaths and 100 million cases of poverty annually are attributable to lack of access to public services. Our project has the potential to contribute significantly to reducing these numbers, promoting inclusive development and improving the lives of millions of people worldwide."
