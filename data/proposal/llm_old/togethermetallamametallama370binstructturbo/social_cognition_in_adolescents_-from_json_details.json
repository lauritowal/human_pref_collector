        "Here is a 268-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\n\nThis longitudinal study aims to elucidate the dynamic interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescent development. We will investigate how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure, and how these relationships impact social-cognitive functions. Our research will integrate social network research and social brain research, focusing on a cohort of 1000 adolescents from 50 classes. Over three years, we will collect six measurements, including social network data from surveys and mobile sensing, and fMRI scans from a subsample of 100 participants on a yearly basis. Experimental tasks will assess understanding others and interacting with others, while ecological momentary assessment will provide insight into daily social experiences.\n\nBy examining the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition and their relationship with social network dynamics, we will clarify how adolescents' social brain development influences their social relationships and vice versa. Our findings will have significant implications for the development of interventions aimed at promoting healthy social relationships and mitigating the negative consequences of social isolation or rejection during adolescence. This study's innovative approach will advance our understanding of the complex interactions between social networks and the social brain, ultimately informing strategies to support adolescents' social and emotional well-being.",

Our research will integrate social network research and social brain research to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure. We will recruit a cohort of 1000 adolescents from 50 classes and collect data on their social networks and social-cognitive functions through six measurements over three years. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo yearly fMRI scans to examine the neural basis of social cognition. Experimental tasks will focus on understanding others and interacting with others, and ecological momentary assessment will be used to capture real-time social experiences. Social networks data will be collected through surveys and mobile sensing. By examining the co-development of social brain networks and social networks, this study will provide novel insights into the social-cognitive processes that shape adolescent relationships and social behavior. Our findings will inform strategies for promoting healthy social development and mitigating social difficulties during adolescence. Ultimately, this research has the potential to improve adolescent mental health and well-being by identifying key factors that influence social relationships and social cognition during this critical developmental period.",
        "Here is a 268-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\n\nThis longitudinal study aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescence, a critical period of rapid social and neural development. We will recruit a cohort of 1000 adolescents from 50 classes and track their social networks and social-cognitive functions over three years, with six measurements. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo yearly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of social cognition. We will employ a range of innovative tools, including social network analysis, social neuroscience experimental approaches, ecological momentary assessment, and mobile sensing, to capture the complexities of adolescents' social lives.\n\nOur goal is to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development. We will investigate how adolescents' abilities to understand others and interact with others influence their social network dynamics, and how, in turn, their social network experiences shape their social brain development. By integrating social network research and social brain research, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the reciprocal relationships between social cognition, social networks, and brain development during adolescence. The findings will have significant implications for the development of interventions aimed at promoting healthy social development and reducing social-emotional difficulties during this critical life stage."
