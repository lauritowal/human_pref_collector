        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers' Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe\n\nThe teaching profession in Europe faces significant challenges, including low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This systematic comparative project aims to investigate the institutional dimensions underlying these issues, focusing on Belgium, France, and England. Our objectives are to explain the nature of teacher policies, understand changes in the teaching profession's status, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration.\n\nEmploying a post-comparative mixed-method design, we will conduct policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, and multilevel multi-group analyses. Semi-structured interviews will also be used to gather data from non-entrants and early leavers. Our data sources will include national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility.\n\nThis project will generate new theoretical knowledge and reconceptualize institutional change in the teaching profession. By examining the cultural roots and institutional transformations of teachers' careers, we will provide insights into the complex relationships between educational systems, teacher policies, and the teaching profession. Our findings will inform policymakers and stakeholders, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective strategies to attract, retain, and develop high-quality teachers in Europe.",
        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers' Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe\n\nThe teaching profession in Europe faces significant challenges, including low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This systematic comparative project aims to investigate the cultural roots and institutional transformations affecting teachers' careers and the teaching profession in three European countries: Belgium, France, and England. The project's objectives are fourfold: to explain the nature of teacher policy, understand changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration.\n\nUsing a post-comparative mixed-method design, the project will employ a range of methods, including policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, multilevel multi-group analyses, and semi-structured interviews. The study will draw on national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility. The project will focus on two key participant groups: non-entrants and early leavers.\n\nThe expected output of this project is twofold: new theoretical knowledge on the institutional dimensions affecting teachers' careers and the teaching profession, and a reconceptualization of institutional change in the context of educational systems. By shedding light on the complex interplay between cultural roots and institutional transformations, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and researchers seeking to address the challenges facing the teaching profession in Europe.",

Our findings will inform evidence-based policies to address teacher shortages and improve the teaching profession's status in Europe. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the development of more effective educational systems, enhancing the quality of education and the teaching profession as a whole."
