        "Here is a 259-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\nThis project aims to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Despite the importance of social interaction in human behavior, studying social information representation poses significant conceptual and technical challenges, and experiments often rely on simplistic and impoverished social stimuli. Recent advances in brain signal analysis offer new opportunities to address these limitations. Our approach will involve studying social interaction under naturalistic settings, measuring temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals, and employing novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition. We hypothesize that selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with synchronous brain activity, and intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow. This naturalistic neuroscience approach has the potential to improve our understanding of brain dynamics of social interaction and contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. Ultimately, this project may lead to the development of novel interventions and strategies for enhancing social cognition and communication.",

By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying social interaction, this project has the potential to contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. The proposed naturalistic neuroscience approach will provide a more nuanced understanding of brain dynamics during social interaction, ultimately informing strategies to improve social cognition and communication."
