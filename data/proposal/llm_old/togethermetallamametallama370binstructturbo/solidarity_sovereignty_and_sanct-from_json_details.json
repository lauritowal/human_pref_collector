        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\n\nThis project offers a comprehensive and comparative history of boat refugees since the 1940s, examining how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary have shaped their experiences and outcomes. Focusing on four key periods and locations - Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean in the 1940s, Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea in the 1970s and 1980s, Cuban and Haitian refugees in the Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s, and refugees arriving in Australia, Yemen, and Europe via the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean since the 1990s - this project seeks to answer the central research question: How did notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? Through a multi-method approach, incorporating interviews with boat refugees and non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage, this project will shed light on the complex dynamics of solidarity and sovereignty that have defined the journeys of over 1 million boat refugees since 1940. By \"thinking through seas,\" \"going beyond the state,\" and \"comparing across time and space,\" this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum via sea routes, and the ways in which solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary have shaped their experiences and outcomes.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive and comparative history of boat refugees since the 1940s, examining the interplay between solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping their experiences and outcomes. Focusing on four key periods and regions – Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean in the 1940s, Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea in the 1970s-80s, Cuban and Haitian refugees in the Caribbean in the 1980s-90s, and refugees traversing the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean in the 1990s-2000s – this research will explore how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influenced the journeys and receptions of boat refugees across time and space.\n\nThrough a multi-method approach incorporating interviews with boat refugees and non-state and state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage, this project will investigate key research questions: Who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? How did solidarity onboard and encounters with non-state actors shape refugee experiences? How did states respond to boat refugees at sea, and what were the implications for attainment of sanctuary?\n\nBy \"thinking through seas\" and moving beyond the state-centric approach, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding boat refugees and their quest for safety and protection. The findings will contribute to a more comprehensive and empathetic understanding of the experiences of boat refugees, informing contemporary policy and humanitarian responses to this pressing global issue.",
