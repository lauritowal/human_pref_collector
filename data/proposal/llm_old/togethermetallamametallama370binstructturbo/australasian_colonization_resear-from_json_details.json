        "Here is a 282-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to unravel the mysteries of the peopling of Australasia, which occurred by circa 50,000 years ago. The colonization of Sahul, a continent comprising present-day Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands, represents the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the earliest 'open water' crossing. Our research aims to answer the question of how this remarkable feat was achieved by examining the when, where, who, and how of earliest seafaring.\n\nTo achieve this, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics. Our objectives include examining the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf, identifying potential submerged prehistoric sites, and enhancing our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. We will also resolve questions of demography and dating using mtDNA and Y-chromosome data.\n\nFocusing on the Sunda region of South East Asia and Sahul, our research will provide a refined understanding of the onshore and offshore environments, shedding light on human origins, population dynamics, and migration patterns. We expect to gain insights into the seafaring technology, social organization, and cognition of the earliest colonizers. By exploring the complexities of this pivotal event in human history, our project will significantly advance our knowledge of human migration, cultural development, and the evolution of seafaring capabilities.",

The colonization of Sahul (Australasia) is a pivotal event in human history, marking the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the earliest \"open water\" crossing.

Our methodology will involve a multidisciplinary approach, combining offshore and onshore environment research, as well as archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include refined knowledge of the onshore and offshore environment, a deeper understanding of human origins, insights into population dynamics and migration, knowledge of seafaring technology, and information on social organisation and cognition.
