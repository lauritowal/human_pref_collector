        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nThis project proposes a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation into meritocratic narratives in literature, exploring how writing practices shape and critique meritocratic articulations across cultures and historical periods. Despite its global relevance, meritocracy has been criticized for enmeshing with structures of domination and privilege. Current research gaps include a lack of investigation into formal principles, a narrow focus on Western contexts, and a concentration on recent developments.\n\nThe MERLIT project aims to address these gaps by exploring historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, expanding the contextual focus to the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. Through six work packages, this interdisciplinary project will bring together literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation to offer a literary history of meritocratic thought, advance understanding of hegemonic forms in writing, and highlight literature's worldmaking role. By doing so, MERLIT will provide a nuanced understanding of meritocracy's complex and contested nature, shedding light on its implications for social justice and equality.",
        "Here is a 283-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nThis project, MERLIT, undertakes a systematic, diachronic, and comparative examination of meritocratic narratives in literature, addressing critical gaps in current research. Despite its pervasive influence, meritocracy has been criticized for enmeshing with structures of domination and perpetuating privilege. However, there is a lack of investigations into the formal principles shaping meritocratic articulations and critiques in literature, as well as a narrow focus on Western contexts and recent developments.\n\nMERLIT aims to explore the practices of writing that shape meritocratic narratives, expanding the contextual focus to the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. The project will engage with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, offering a literary history of meritocratic thought. By advancing our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing, MERLIT will highlight literature's worldmaking role in shaping cultural values and social norms.\n\nThrough six work packages, this interdisciplinary project will draw on literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation to achieve its objectives. By transcending traditional boundaries, MERLIT will provide a nuanced understanding of meritocracy's complex and evolving nature, making a significant contribution to our understanding of power, identity, and culture. Ultimately, MERLIT will demonstrate the critical role of literature in shaping our understanding of meritocracy and its implications for a more equitable society.",
        "Here is a 283-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nThis project undertakes a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation of meritocratic narratives in literature, addressing significant research gaps in the field. Despite their pervasiveness, meritocratic narratives have been criticized for enmeshing with structures of domination and privilege. MERLIT seeks to explore the practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques, expanding the contextual focus to include the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. The project's six work packages will engage with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, advancing our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing. By integrating literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation, MERLIT will offer a comprehensive literary history of meritocratic thought, highlighting literature's worldmaking role in shaping our understanding of meritocracy. This project's global relevance lies in its potential to provide a nuanced, transcultural understanding of meritocracy's impact on social and cultural dynamics. By addressing the lack of investigations into formal principles, narrow focus on Western contexts, and concentration on recent developments, MERLIT will provide a groundbreaking framework for analyzing the complex relationships between literature, power, and social inequality. Ultimately, MERLIT aims to illuminate the ways in which literature reflects, shapes, and challenges dominant ideologies, informing more inclusive and equitable conceptions of meritocracy."
