        "Here is a 288-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nThis project investigates the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, questioning whether they have the potential to enhance democracy. Despite the proliferation of multi-party elections in Africa, many countries remain stuck in authoritarianism, prompting a critical examination of the relationship between legislatures and democratic consolidation. Our research objective is to explore the capacity of legislatures to promote democratic governance in electoral autocracies, addressing the theoretical debate on whether repeated multi-party elections strengthen or weaken authoritarian rule.\n\nThe study will employ a mixed-methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative data from seven African countries. We will conduct content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing to examine legislative behavior in three key areas: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness. Our data collection will include content analysis of parliamentary debates and national assembly surveys, capturing biographical, opinion, and social interactions data.\n\nCollaborating with a strong team of partner institutions in seven African countries, this project will contribute to the literature by collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies. By exploring the potential of legislatures to enhance democracy in Africa, this research aims to inform strategies for democratic consolidation and provide actionable insights for policymakers, civil society, and international organizations seeking to promote democratic governance in Africa.",
        "Here is a 288-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nThis project investigates the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, seeking to answer the question: Do legislatures in authoritarian countries have the potential to enhance democracy? Despite the widespread adoption of multi-party systems and regular elections, many African countries remain authoritarian. This project challenges the prevailing views that elections and multi-party systems either prolong autocracies or increase democracy. It aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the legislative branch's impact on democratic consolidation.\n\nThe study will employ a mixed-methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative data from seven African countries. The analysis will involve content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. The research will focus on three areas: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness.\n\nThe project will collect extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies, addressing the opaque nature of authoritarian regimes and limited research on African cases. A strong team of partner institutions in seven African countries will collaborate on data collection, including content analysis of parliamentary debates and national assembly surveys gathering biographical, opinion, and social interactions data.\n\nThis project's contribution lies in providing a comprehensive understanding of the legislature's role in enhancing democracy in African electoral authoritarian regimes. The findings will inform policy and practice, ultimately supporting efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and promote democratic consolidation in Africa.",

Despite the prevalence of multi-party elections, many African countries remain autocratic, and the impact of legislatures on democratization is poorly understood. This mixed-methods study will collect extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in seven African countries, addressing the knowledge gap in our understanding of legislative institutions in electoral autocracies.\n\nThe project will employ a range of analysis techniques, including content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. The study will focus on three areas of investigation: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness. A strong team of partner institutions in the seven African countries will collaborate on data collection, including content analysis of parliamentary debates and surveys of national assemblies.\n\nThis project aims to contribute to the theoretical debate on the relationship between elections, multi-party systems, and democratization, and to provide insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to strengthen democratic institutions in Africa. By shedding light on the potential of legislatures to enhance democracy in electoral authoritarian regimes, this study will inform strategies for promoting democratic governance and accountability in Africa."
