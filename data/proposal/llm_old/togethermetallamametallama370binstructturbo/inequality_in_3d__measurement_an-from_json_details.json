        "Here is a 257-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory\n\nThis project aims to advance our understanding of the complex interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy. By measuring the economy at the household level across three dimensions – consumption, income, and wealth – we will provide a more nuanced understanding of the distribution of economic resources and its implications for macroeconomic theory. Our approach combines novel microdata with heterogeneous agent models, contrasting with traditional representative agent models, to quantify the micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory. \n\nThrough disciplined empirical efforts informed by recent modeling developments, we expect to inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing novel insights for improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools. Our research will also contribute to the ongoing debate on economic inequality, providing lessons for policymakers on how to address this pressing issue. By better understanding the mechanisms underlying inequality and its macroeconomic implications, we can ultimately inform more effective policy decisions that promote economic stability and prosperity for all. This project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of the economy and our ability to address pressing social and economic challenges.",
        "Here is a 257-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory\n\nThis project aims to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between inequality and the macroeconomy by developing a novel, three-dimensional approach to measuring inequality at the household level. By integrating consumption, income, and wealth into a single framework, we will provide a more comprehensive picture of economic inequality than traditional one-dimensional measures. Our approach will utilize novel microdata and heterogeneous agent models, contrasted with traditional representative agent models, to quantify the micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory. This research will inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing novel insights for improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools. Furthermore, our findings will contribute to the ongoing debate on economic inequality, providing lessons to policymakers on how to address this pressing issue. By disciplined empirical efforts, we will shed new light on the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the economy and informing evidence-based policy decisions. The expected outcomes of this project have the potential to significantly impact the field of macroeconomics and inform policy decisions that promote greater economic equality and stability.",
        "Here is a 257-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory\n\nThis project seeks to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between inequality and the macroeconomy by measuring the economy at the household level across three dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth. Using novel microdata and heterogeneous agent models, we will quantify the micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory, moving beyond traditional representative agent models. Our disciplined empirical approach will be informed by recent modeling developments, ensuring that our findings are robust and reliable.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are far-reaching. We anticipate providing novel insights for improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools, informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models, and contributing to the ongoing debate on economic inequality. Our research will also provide lessons for policymakers, enabling them to better address economic inequality and its implications for the macroeconomy.\n\nBy studying the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, this project aims to generate a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics at play. Our findings will have important implications for policy design, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and stable economy. We believe that this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of macroeconomic theory and policy, and we look forward to the opportunity to pursue this research."
