        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\n\nThis project proposes the creation of a comprehensive online library of all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse, spanning the period of c. 670-1100 CE. The library will feature a corpus of approximately 60,000 lines of poetry, equally divided between Old English and Anglo-Latin, drawn from manuscript witnesses. The collection will be marked up using TEI P5 XML, enabling interactive and in-depth analysis of the poetry. A key focus of the project is documenting the influence of named poets, of which there are around 50, as well as tracing potential influence in anonymous verse. The digital resource will also include sound-files and image-files to enhance user engagement.\n\nThe project will foster collaboration and knowledge exchange through conferences, workshops, and a series of publications showcasing the comprehensive multilingual corpus. By providing a consolidated and interactive platform for Anglo-Saxon poetry, this project will have a significant research impact across Europe, shedding new light on the coexistence of Latin and the vernacular in a Christian context. The library will serve as a valuable resource for scholars, students, and enthusiasts alike, promoting a deeper understanding of Anglo-Saxon literature and its cultural significance. By supporting this project, you will be contributing to a major advancement in the field of Anglo-Saxon studies, with far-reaching benefits for research, education, and cultural heritage.",

The library will consist of 60,000 lines of poetry, equally divided between Old English and Anglo-Latin, drawn from manuscript witnesses. The project's primary focus is twofold: documenting the influence of named poets, of which there are approximately 50, and tracing potential influence in anonymous verse. The corpus will be marked up in TEI P5 XML, enabling interactive and in-depth analysis of the poetry.\n\nThe digital library will be enriched with sound-files and image-files, providing a multifaceted research environment. To facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration, the project will host conferences and workshops, ultimately leading to a series of publications focused on the comprehensive multilingual corpus. This project will have a significant impact on the research community, with a geographical scope that encompasses Europe and a context that sheds light on the coexistence of Latin and the vernacular in a Christian context. By consolidating and making accessible this vast corpus of Anglo-Saxon poetry, this project will revolutionize the field of medieval studies, enabling new research questions and fostering a deeper understanding of this pivotal period in literary history."
