        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive investigation into the Latin translations of Aristotle's works, focusing on the textual variance in hundreds of handwritten books from the 12th and 13th centuries. By documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses, this research aims to develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science. The study will concentrate on three critical editions of treatises: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo.\n\nThe project's main goal is to explore new ways to read the Latin Aristotle, shedding light on the impact of textual fluidity in manuscripts on the understanding of Aristotelian thought in the late medieval and early modern periods. This research will have significant implications for the fields of philosophy, science, and theology, offering a deeper understanding of how readers engaged with recently available translations that differed fundamentally from the Greek originals.\n\nBy examining the dynamic nature of medieval manuscripts, this project will provide evidence of how readers interacted with and interpreted Aristotelian texts, revealing the complexities of knowledge transmission and reception in the Middle Ages. The outcomes of this research will not only enrich our understanding of Aristotelian thought but also contribute to the development of new methodologies for studying medieval translations of philosophical and scientific texts. Ultimately, this project will demonstrate the significance of textual fluidity in shaping our understanding of the medieval intellectual landscape.",
        "Title: Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive investigation into the textual variance in handwritten books preserving Latin translations of Aristotle's works from the 12th and 13th centuries. Focusing on hundreds of manuscripts, this project will document variant readings in manuscript witnesses of three critical treatises: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. By examining the textual fluidity in these manuscripts, we will uncover evidence of how readers engaged with recently available translations, often differing significantly from the Greek originals. This innovative research will develop a new model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science, shedding light on the dynamic nature of knowledge transmission during the late medieval and early modern periods. The project's impact will be felt across philosophy, science, and theology, providing a nuanced understanding of the evolution of Aristotelian thought and its reception in the Latin West. Ultimately, this study will revolutionize our understanding of the medieval intellectual landscape, revealing the complex and adaptive nature of knowledge transmission during a pivotal period in Western intellectual history.",
