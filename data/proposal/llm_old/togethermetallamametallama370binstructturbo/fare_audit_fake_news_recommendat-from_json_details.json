        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results\n\nThe proliferation of disinformation online poses a significant threat to democratic institutions and society as a whole. Search engines, in particular, play a critical role in disseminating false information, yet their influence remains poorly understood. The FARE_AUDIT project aims to address this knowledge gap by developing an innovative auditing system to investigate how browsing history shapes search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation.\n\nOur system will enable democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time, breaching information bubbles by simulating diverse user online profiles. The tool features an innovative auditing component for search engines, privacy-protecting web-crawlers, and does not require real user data. By shifting the focus from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting, FARE_AUDIT will provide a more accurate understanding of search engines' role in spreading disinformation.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include increased public awareness of search engines' contribution to disinformation spread and equipping organizations with a robust tool for disinformation detection and monitoring. Ultimately, FARE_AUDIT will contribute to a safer and more informed online environment, promoting a healthier democracy. By supporting this project, we can take a critical step towards curbing the spread of disinformation and fostering a more informed citizenry.",

The FARE_AUDIT project aims to address this knowledge gap by developing an innovative auditing system that investigates how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation.\n\nOur system will simulate diverse user online profiles to breach information bubbles and identify new disinformation in near real-time, without requiring real user data.

By creating a democracy-promoting system for institutions and concerned citizens, we anticipate increased public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread and equipping organizations with a disinformation detection and monitoring tool.

Search engines, in particular, have been implicated in perpetuating the spread of false information, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. The FARE_AUDIT project aims to address this knowledge gap by developing an innovative auditing system to investigate how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation. Our system will enable democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time, while breaching information bubbles by simulating diverse user online profiles. Notably, our approach will not require real user data, ensuring privacy protection. By developing a pioneering auditing tool for search engines, we anticipate that FARE_AUDIT will increase public awareness of the role of search engines in spreading disinformation and equip organizations with a powerful tool for detection and monitoring. This project represents a critical step towards promoting a more informed and resilient digital public sphere."
