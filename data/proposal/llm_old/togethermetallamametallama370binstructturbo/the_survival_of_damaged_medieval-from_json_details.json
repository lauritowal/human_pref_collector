        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics (POLYCHROME)\n\nThis project investigates the fate of medieval polychromed Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, exploring the transformation of these objects from devotional artifacts to cultural heritage. Focusing on the period since the Reformation, we aim to assess the risk to these cultural treasures and challenge current assumptions about their damage, which are often attributed to accidents or unspecified vandalism. Our hypothesis suggests that iconoclastic acts are a significant contributor to their deterioration.\n\nThrough the application of technologies from the natural sciences, we will conduct an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collecting material data and mapping restorations and repairs. This research will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and stimulate debate about heritage values and future care.\n\nThe project addresses a significant research gap, as the current status, volatility, and repair history of these objects are poorly understood. By overcoming challenges such as limited archival evidence and secondary paints masking information, we expect to gain a deeper understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism on these cultural artifacts. Our findings will influence training priorities and inform strategies for their conservation and preservation. Ultimately, POLYCHROME will contribute to a richer understanding of the complex cultural heritage of the Nordic region.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics (POLYCHROME)\n\nThis project investigates the fate of medieval polychromed Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. Focusing on painted and gilded wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces, we aim to understand the reasons behind their damage and deterioration. Contrary to current assumptions that accidents and unspecified vandalism are responsible, we hypothesize that iconoclastic acts during the Protestant Reformation are a primary cause of damage.\n\nTo address the significant research gap in the status, volatility, and repairs of these objects, we will employ advanced technologies from the natural sciences. Our objectives include creating an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collecting material data, mapping restorations and repairs, and establishing foundations for multidisciplinary studies. We will also facilitate a debate about heritage values and future care.\n\nOur expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how Lutheranism has influenced the preservation of cultural heritage in the Nordics and the identification of training priorities for future conservators and curators. By shedding light on the complex history of these artifacts, this project will contribute to a more informed approach to their conservation and preservation. Ultimately, POLYCHROME aims to ensure the long-term survival of these valuable cultural treasures and promote a nuanced understanding of their significance in the Nordic region.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics (POLYCHROME)\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the damage sustained by medieval polychromed Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. Focusing on painted and gilded wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces, we aim to understand the causes and consequences of damage to these cultural heritage objects. Historically, the break with the Church in Rome in 1527 (Sweden) and 1537 (Denmark-Norway) led to iconoclastic acts, which are hypothesized to be linked to the damage observed in these objects. Current assumptions attribute the damage to accidents or unspecified vandalism, but a thorough analysis is lacking.\n\nThe POLYCHROME project will employ technologies from the natural sciences to analyze approximately 150 polychromed objects, collecting material data, mapping restorations and repairs, and establishing foundations for multidisciplinary studies. By doing so, we will provide an analytical overview of the status, volatility, and repairs of these objects, addressing the current research gap. Our expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how Lutheranism has influenced the preservation of these cultural heritage objects and the identification of training priorities for their future care.\n\nUltimately, this project will contribute to a nuanced debate about heritage values and inform strategies for the conservation and preservation of these irreplaceable artifacts, which have transformed from devotional objects to cultural heritage treasures."
