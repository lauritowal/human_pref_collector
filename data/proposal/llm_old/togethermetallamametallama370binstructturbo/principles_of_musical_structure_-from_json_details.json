        "Here is a 288-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\nThis project aims to advance our understanding of human cognition by investigating the complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures that underlie music perception. The proposed research integrates theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax, compile a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, and test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure.\n\nTheoretically, we will develop a unified syntax theory that exceeds the expressive power of tree-based context-free grammars, focusing on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints. Computationally, we will implement this theory using generalized parsing and graph grammars, and evaluate it through analytical corpus-based training and evaluation. Experimentally, we will test predictions about nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension in mental representations of musical structure.\n\nThis project will contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences by providing a deeper understanding of how humans process and represent complex musical structures. The outcomes will have implications for music theory, music information retrieval, and cognitive models of music perception. By integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, this project will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the principles of musical structure building and their role in human cognition.",
        "Here is a 288-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\nThis interdisciplinary project aims to advance our understanding of human cognition by investigating the complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures that underlie music perception. The proposal comprises three interconnected strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental.\n\nTheoretically, we will develop a novel, unified theory of musical syntax that surpasses the limitations of current context-free approaches, focusing on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes involved in music perception.\n\nComputationally, we will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, utilizing a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars. The corpus will be analytically trained and evaluated, enabling the development of more sophisticated music information retrieval systems.\n\nExperimentally, we will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, exploring nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. This will provide valuable insights into the cognitive mechanisms that govern music perception and processing.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences, shedding new light on the intricacies of human cognition and the complex structures that underlie music perception. By integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, we will develop a deeper understanding of the principles of musical structure building and its implications for our understanding of human cognition.",
