        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\n\nSynSig, a novel research project, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its impact on mental health. Challenging the prevailing assumption that \"higher synchrony equals better,\" this project will investigate how individual-specific synchrony signatures influence mental health outcomes. Our objectives are threefold: (1) to identify individual-specific synchrony signatures, (2) to develop individual-tailored correction of synchrony signatures, and (3) to analyze the transformation of relationships into curative ones through synchrony adjustments.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a multimodal approach, incorporating motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals in dyadic interactions with both human and virtual human partners. We will develop the first multimodal feedback system to facilitate momentary deviations from synchrony signatures, enabling individual-tailored changes in synchrony. Through this innovative approach, we expect to provide evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health outcomes.\n\nUltimately, SynSig aims to transform our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its role in mental health, paving the way for the development of novel, individualized interventions that harness the curative potential of synchrony. By supporting this project, we can unlock the secrets of synchrony and improve mental health outcomes for individuals worldwide.",
        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: An Individual-Specific Understanding of How Synchrony Becomes Curative\n\nSynSig, a novel research project, aims to revolutionize our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its impact on mental health. Challenging the prevailing assumption that \"higher synchrony equals better,\" this project seeks to uncover individual-specific synchrony signatures and their role in curative relationships. Our objectives are threefold: to investigate and characterize individual-specific synchrony signatures, to explore tailored corrections of these signatures, and to analyze the transformation of relationships into curative ones through synchrony adjustments.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a multimodal approach, incorporating motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals in dyadic interactions with both human and virtual human partners. We will develop the first multimodal feedback system to facilitate momentary deviations from synchrony signatures, enabling individual-tailored changes in synchrony. By drawing causal inferences between synchrony changes and mental health outcomes, we expect to provide evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the multi-layered nature of synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. The proposed project has the potential to transform our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its role in promoting mental well-being, ultimately informing the development of personalized interventions and therapies.",
        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\n\nSynSig proposes a groundbreaking investigation into the complex relationship between interpersonal synchrony and mental health, moving beyond the oversimplified assumption that higher synchrony always equals better outcomes. Our project seeks to understand how individual-specific synchrony signatures impact mental health, and how tailored corrections can transform relationships into curative ones.\n\nTo achieve this, we will employ a multimodal approach, incorporating motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals in dyadic interactions with both human and virtual human partners. We will develop the first multimodal feedback system to detect momentary deviations from individual synchrony signatures, enabling real-time, personalized adjustments to promote healthy synchrony patterns.\n\nThrough this innovative approach, we expect to provide evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, shedding light on the multi-layered nature of synchrony and its connection to mental health outcomes. Our project will facilitate a deeper understanding of how human interactions impact mental health, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to improve mental wellbeing.\n\nBy challenging the prevailing 'one-size-fits-all' approach to synchrony research, SynSig has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the intricate dynamics between interpersonal synchrony and mental health, ultimately leading to more effective, personalized treatments for mental health disorders."
