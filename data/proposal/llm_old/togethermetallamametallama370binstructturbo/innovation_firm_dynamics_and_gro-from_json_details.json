        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: What Do We Learn from French Firm-Level Data?\n\nThis research project seeks to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and policies driving innovation, growth, and social mobility. Grounded in Schumpeterian theory, we will leverage French firm-level data to investigate the interplay between innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions. Our study will tackle four key research questions: (1) How can we accurately measure productivity growth, accounting for new innovations? (2) What are the causal links between export and import activities and innovation? (3) How do fiscal and institutional changes affect entrepreneurial incentives, particularly self-employment? (4) What is the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing, including its impact on social mobility and health? By exploring these questions, we aim to shed light on pressing growth aspects, including the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Our ultimate goal is to inform evidence-based growth policy design, ensuring that innovation-driven growth is inclusive and benefits all members of society.",

(3) How do fiscal and institutional changes affect entrepreneurship and self-employment incentives? (4) What is the impact of creative destruction on social mobility, health, and wellbeing? Our project will provide new insights into the middle income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics, ultimately informing growth policy design. By confronting theory with data, we aim to deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between innovation, growth, and social mobility, and to develop evidence-based policy recommendations to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth.",
        "Here is a 276-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: What do we learn from French firm-level data?\n\nThis research project aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and policies of innovation, and their relationship with economic growth and social mobility. Grounded in Schumpeterian theory, we will investigate the role of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions in driving growth. Our analysis will focus on four key research questions: (1) measuring productivity growth and identifying TFP growth factors that account for new innovation; (2) examining the causal links between export and import activities and innovation; (3) assessing the impact of fiscal and institutional changes on self-employment incentives; and (4) exploring the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing. We will employ French firm-level data to explore these questions, with a particular emphasis on the growth aspects of middle-income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Our ultimate goal is to inform growth policy design that promotes innovation, entrepreneurship, and social mobility. By confronting theory and data, this project will provide new insights into the complex relationships between innovation, growth, and social outcomes, ultimately contributing to the development of evidence-based policies that foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth."
