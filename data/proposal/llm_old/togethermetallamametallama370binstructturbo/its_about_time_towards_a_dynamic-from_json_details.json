        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\n\nThe TIME project proposes a paradigm shift in the study of natural vision, moving beyond traditional static and fragmented approaches to understanding visual perception. Our objective is to investigate vision as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process that is geared towards meaningful understanding. We will achieve this by exploring active information sampling in vision and analyzing visual processing across multiple timeframes.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach will combine non-invasive human brain imaging with multivariate analysis techniques and large-scale computational modelling. We will conduct a visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich, human-annotated natural scenes, develop novel multivariate analysis techniques, and create a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision.\n\nThe goals of this project are twofold: to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain, and to integrate information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. By achieving these goals, we expect to make a significant impact on the field of vision research, providing new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions and promoting a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision. Ultimately, the TIME project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of vision and its role in shaping our interaction with the world.",
        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\n\nThe TIME project proposes a paradigm shift in understanding human vision, moving beyond traditional, static, and fragmented approaches to study vision as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process. Our objective is to investigate vision in a more natural setting, where the brain is geared towards semantic understanding and actively samples information from the environment. We will employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining non-invasive human brain imaging, multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modelling to explore vision across multiple timeframes. Our methods will involve visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, development of novel multivariate analysis techniques, and creation of a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision. Our goals are to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain and to integrate information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. The proposed project will have a significant impact on the field, providing new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions and aligning biological and synthetic vision more closely. By understanding vision as a dynamic and active process, we can develop more effective models and applications in areas such as computer vision, robotics, and neuroscience.",
        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\n\nThe TIME project revolutionizes the study of natural vision by shifting the focus from static, fragmented representations to a dynamic, active, and semantic process. Our objective is to understand how the human brain extracts meaning from visual inputs in a more natural, real-world setting. We will achieve this by combining interdisciplinary approaches, non-invasive human brain imaging, and cutting-edge multivariate analysis techniques. Our methods involve visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich, human-annotated natural scenes, development of novel analysis techniques, and creation of a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision.\n\nOur goals are ambitious: to pinpoint when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain, and to integrate information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. By achieving these goals, TIME will have a profound impact on the field, driving a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision. Our research will provide new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions, ultimately bridging the gap between biological and synthetic vision. By transforming our understanding of vision, TIME will have far-reaching implications for fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, paving the way for breakthroughs in applications like autonomous systems, healthcare, and education."
