        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, with a focus on the role of post-ingestive calories in shaping our food choices. We hypothesize that this behavior has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits. Using a combination of computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation, we will study the selection of food and the processing of post-ingestive information in both rodents and humans. Our experiments will include human probabilistic decision-making tasks to examine how energy content and vagus nerve information transmission influence food choice. We will also explore how these mechanisms are disrupted in obesity, a condition characterized by aberrant food-seeking behavior. By elucidating the neural circuits and mechanisms involved in post-ingestive reinforcement, this project aims to provide new insights into the drive to eat and its modulation, ultimately informing the development of novel interventions for obesity and related disorders.",

We hypothesize that the drive to eat is mediated by a dopaminergic substrate, associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach combining computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Our study will involve both rodent and human subjects, examining healthy individuals as well as those with obesity.\n\nWe will investigate how post-ingestive information about energy content influences food selection, and how this information is transmitted from the body to the brain via the vagus nerve. Human participants will complete probabilistic decision-making tasks to assess the neural mechanisms underlying food choice. Our research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural circuits and mechanisms that drive food-seeking behavior, and how these are disrupted in disease states such as obesity. By elucidating the neural basis of food selection, this project has the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and related disorders.",
        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\n\nThe drive to eat is a fundamental aspect of human behavior, modulated by sensory feedback and post-ingestive information about energy content. This proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, focusing on the critical role of post-ingestive calories in shaping food selection. Our central hypothesis is that this behavior has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits.\n\nUsing a multidisciplinary approach, we will employ computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation to investigate the relationship between post-ingestive information and food choice in both rodents and humans. We will conduct probabilistic decision-making tasks in humans to examine how energy content and vagus nerve information transmission influence food selection. A key focus of this project will be to explore how these mechanisms are disrupted in disease states, particularly obesity.\n\nBy elucidating the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying the reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, this project aims to provide critical insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for obesity and other eating disorders. Ultimately, our research will shed light on the complex interplay between the body and brain in regulating food intake, with important implications for public health and policy."
