        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Silence of States in International Law\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the silence of States in international law, a critical yet understudied topic. The proposed research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications of State silence, inaction, and their binding nature in international law. The study will develop a taxonomy of State silences, analyzing their legal effects and critically assessing whether a change in the law is necessary.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining analysis of State practice in six official UN languages, international jurisprudence, and literature, as well as empirical analysis of government officials' and international judges' reasoning, this project will fill a significant knowledge gap. The research will focus on three key areas: the binding nature of State silence, State inaction and responsibility, and State inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its potential to inform and shape the behavior of States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals. By clarifying the legal implications of State silence, this research will contribute to a more effective and efficient international legal system. The project's findings will be disseminated through academic publications, workshops, and policy briefs, ensuring that the research has a lasting impact on international law and practice. Ultimately, this project will provide a foundation for States, international courts, and other stakeholders to navigate the complexities of State silence and inaction in international law.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Silence of States in International Law\n\nThis project undertakes a comprehensive examination of the silence of States in international law, a critical yet understudied topic. The silence of States can have significant legal consequences, but the current understanding of its implications is fragmented and unclear. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by providing a taxonomy of State silence, analyzing its legal effects, and assessing whether a change in the law is necessary. Through a mixed-methods approach combining analysis of State practice in six official UN languages, international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical analysis of government officials' and international judges' reasoning, this project will shed light on the binding nature of State silence, its role in State responsibility, and its impact on international dispute settlement proceedings. The project's findings will have important implications for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of international law.",
