        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Truth and Semantics\n\nThis project, \"Truth and Semantics,\" proposes a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics, and its relationship to the research on semantic paradoxes in the form of theories of self-applicable truth. The project tackles two interconnected challenges: \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics.\" The first challenge aims to develop semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, focusing on the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. The second challenge adopts a metasemantic perspective to investigate the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics. By addressing these challenges, the project seeks to provide the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective. The expected outcome is a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between truth and natural language semantics, which will have significant implications for the development of formal semantic theories and the foundations of linguistic meaning. The project's innovative approach will bridge the gap between philosophical and linguistic research, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between truth, language, and meaning.",

The outcome will be a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between truth, semantics, and natural language, shedding light on the fundamental principles that govern human communication.\n\nThis project's innovative approach will have significant implications for linguistic theory, philosophy of language, and cognitive science, offering new insights into the nature of truth and its role in shaping our understanding of the world. By providing a unified framework for truth and semantics, this project will pave the way for future research in these fields and contribute to a deeper understanding of human language and cognition.",

The project addresses two interconnected challenges: \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics.\" The first challenge aims to develop comprehensive semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, incorporating key elements such as the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals.

The outcome will be a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between truth, meaning, and language, shedding light on the fundamental principles governing human communication. The project's findings will have significant implications for linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science, informing the development of more accurate and effective natural language processing systems and artificial intelligence models. Ultimately, \"Truth and Semantics\" will advance our understanding of the complex interplay between truth, language, and the human experience."
