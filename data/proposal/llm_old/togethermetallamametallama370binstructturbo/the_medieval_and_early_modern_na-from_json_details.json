        "Here is a 310-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\nThis project seeks to illuminate the least studied and understood aspects of maritime expansion: the medieval and early modern nautical chart. Despite their significance, these charts have received limited attention, with detailed technical study still in its infancy. This proposal addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the origins, technical evolution, and use of pre-Mercator nautical charts.\n\nUsing an interdisciplinary approach, we will combine analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and specialized lighting techniques to examine manuscripts and uncover hidden graphic content. Our objectives are to characterize the main geometric features of these charts, establish connections with navigational methods, and simulate chart construction numerically.\n\nBuilding on our previous work, which solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this project will tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. Our research will have a significant impact on the field of History of Cartography and intellectual history at large.\n\nBy shedding light on the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts, this project will provide a deeper understanding of the maritime expansion that shaped the modern world. Our findings will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the development of cartography, navigation, and exploration, with far-reaching implications for historians, cartographers, and scholars of intellectual history.",
        "Here is a 310-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to investigate the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods, a critical yet understudied area in the history of cartography. Despite their importance in maritime expansion, these charts remain poorly understood, with detailed technical studies still in their infancy. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by answering key research questions: What was the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts? How did they evolve technically over time? And how were they used at sea?\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling, and the examination of manuscripts using special lighting techniques. Our research objectives are fourfold: to unveil hidden graphic content, characterize the main geometric features of these charts, establish connections with navigational methods, and simulate chart construction numerically.\n\nBuilding on our previous work, which solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this project will scope a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. The expected impact of this research will be significant, not only advancing the field of history of cartography but also contributing to a deeper understanding of intellectual history at large. By shedding new light on the evolution and use of medieval and early modern nautical charts, this project will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the development of navigation and maritime exploration during this pivotal period.",
