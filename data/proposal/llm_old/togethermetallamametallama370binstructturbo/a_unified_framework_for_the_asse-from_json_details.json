        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\n\nCognitive models are increasingly applied throughout cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, but their proliferation has led to idiosyncratic applications and unclear standards. This proposal aims to develop a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models, addressing the current state of disarray in the field. Our approach will be founded on Bayesian inference, enabling the assessment of absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, and the exploration of efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. We will focus on three key models: drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. Enhancements will include the construction of plausible parameter priors, development of diagnostic experiments, and assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs. Our outcome will be a new standard for cognitive modeling, with techniques incorporated into the popular JASP software, making them accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners. The project's practical relevance lies in its potential to improve the rigor and reproducibility of cognitive modeling, ultimately informing theoretical and applied advances in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology.",

        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\n\nCognitive models are increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, but their proliferation has led to idiosyncratic applications and unclear standards. To address this, we propose developing a unified framework for the assessment and application of cognitive models. Our approach will leverage Bayesian inference foundations to assess absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, explore efficient algorithms for parameter estimation, and apply these methods to popular experimental designs. We will focus on three key models: drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. The framework will be enhanced by constructing plausible parameter priors, developing diagnostic experiments, and assessing Bayes factors for hierarchical designs. Our goal is to set a new standard for cognitive modeling, making techniques available through the popular JASP software platform (jasp-stats.org). By providing a unified framework, we will facilitate best practices for students, researchers, and practitioners, ultimately advancing the field of cognitive modeling."
