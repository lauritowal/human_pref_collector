        "Here is a 282-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times (CROME)\n\nThis project explores the complex and contested memories of the colonial-liberation wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. Through a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will examine the evolution of memories and silences in Portugal and its former African colonies, including Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe. Our central hypothesis is that these wars triggered memorialization and silencing processes with their own historicity, shaped by the interests and agendas of postcolonial states.\n\nThe project consists of two interconnected strands. The first, \"Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States,\" investigates the role of states in mobilizing, articulating, recognizing, and selectively representing the past. The second, \"Memory as a battlefield,\" analyzes the dynamics between social and individual memories, and how they are used to shape historical narratives. Our objectives are to produce innovative knowledge about war memories and silences, contrast changes in memory and silence over time, examine historical judgments and memories in Portugal and Africa, offer a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies, and address the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism. By exploring the politics of silence and memory, CROME aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the ongoing impact of colonialism on contemporary societies.",

The objectives of CROME are to produce innovative knowledge about war memories and silences, contrast changes in memory and silence from the end of conflicts to the present, and examine historical judgments and memories in Portugal and African countries.

Ultimately, the project aims to offer a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies and address the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism. By exploring the complex and contested nature of memories and silences, CROME seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the postcolonial condition and its ongoing impact on contemporary societies."
