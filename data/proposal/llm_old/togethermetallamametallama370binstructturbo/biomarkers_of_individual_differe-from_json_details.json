        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\n\nThis proposal seeks to uncover the physiological and personality-based factors that contribute to individual differences in human visual perception. Despite being the best understood system of the human brain, vision is affected by various factors, leading to significant differences in how people perceive the world. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating how vision is influenced by physiological state and personality traits.\n\nUsing a combination of innovative methods, including pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics, we will examine the relationship between cortical processing, metabolism, and perception in normally sighted individuals, including young children. We predict that behavioral and cortical properties will co-vary with personality traits, and that physiological interventions, such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, will modulate perceptual styles.\n\nThe proposed research has significant potential impacts, including changing our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aiding in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and encouraging therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. We expect to identify new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and provide evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic fluctuations. By elucidating the complex relationships between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception, this project will provide new knowledge on the factors driving individual differences in human visual perception.",

Despite being the best understood system of the human brain, vision is still poorly understood when it comes to why normally sighted people perceive the world differently. Our objective is to uncover how physiological state and personality traits influence visual perception, with a focus on normally sighted individuals, including young children.\n\nOur innovative approach combines cutting-edge techniques, including pupil responses, ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics, with physiological interventions such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity. We predict that behavioral and cortical properties will co-vary with personality traits, and that our study will yield new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception. Furthermore, we expect to provide evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic state.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to change our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and encourage therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. By elucidating the complex relationships between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception, this study aims to provide new knowledge that can inform strategies for improving visual perception and overall well-being.",

Despite being the best understood system of the human brain, vision remains poorly understood in terms of why normally sighted people perceive the world differently. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by combining innovative visual processing measures with physiological interventions. Specifically, we will employ pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics to understand how behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits. We will induce ketosis through fasting and intense physical activity to examine the effects of metabolic changes on perception. Our expected outcomes include the discovery of new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic shifts. This project has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, such as Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and inform therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. By elucidating the intricate relationships between physiology, cortical processing, and perception, we can develop novel diagnostic tools and interventions that improve the lives of individuals with visual perception disorders."
