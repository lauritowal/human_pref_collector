        "Here is a 248-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\nIn mega-cities of the Global South, the lack of effective state infrastructure and security has led to the emergence of religious vigilantes, who use violence systematically to maintain order. This project, Sacralizing Security, seeks to understand why residents grant authority to these vigilantes and the role of religion in legitimizing their practices. Through ethnographic comparison, the project will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes in three case study cities: Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta. The research will explore the interactions between religious organizations, non-state security actors, vigilantes, and state actors, and examine how different religious traditions (Christian, Afro-Brazilian, Islamic, and Indigenous) influence vigilantism. The project aims to provide insights into the alternative governance structures in mega-cities, extend the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, and inform policies aimed at improving human security. By shedding light on the complex relationships between religion, violence, and authority, Sacralizing Security will contribute to a deeper understanding of power structures in mega-cities of the Global South and their implications for human security.",
        "Here is a 248-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\nThis project, Sacralizing Security (SACRASEC), examines the emergence of religious vigilantes as providers of security in mega-cities of the Global South, where state agencies lack capacity to provide infrastructure and security. Through ethnographic comparison of three case studies in Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, SACRASEC will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes and their role in alternative governance. The project aims to answer two key research questions: why do mega-city residents grant religious vigilantes authority, and what is the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices?\n\nBy exploring the interactions between religious organizations, non-state security actors, vigilantes, and state actors, SACRASEC will provide new insights into the power structures and alternative governance arrangements in mega-cities of the Global South. The project's findings will contribute to the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, informing policies aimed at improving human security in these regions. By examining the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism, SACRASEC will shed light on the complex relationships between religion, violence, and authority in these urban contexts. Ultimately, SACRASEC will enhance our understanding of the ways in which religious vigilantes shape the governance of mega-cities, and the implications of this phenomenon for human security and well-being.",
        "Here is a 248-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\nThis project, Sacralizing Security, examines the complex relationships between religion, violence, and authority in mega-cities of the Global South, where state agencies often lack the capacity to provide infrastructure and security. In this context, religious vigilantes have emerged as key non-state security actors, using violence systematically to maintain order. Through ethnographic comparison, this research will investigate why mega-city residents grant religious vigilantes authority and what role religion plays in legitimizing their practices. The study will focus on three case studies: Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, exploring the intersections of Christian, Afro-Brazilian, Islamic, and Indigenous religious traditions with vigilantism.\n\nThe project aims to analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes, draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, and enable analysis of the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. By doing so, Sacralizing Security will extend the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, provide knowledge on power structures in mega-cities of the Global South, and contribute to policies aimed at improving human security. This research will offer a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics shaping urban governance and security in the Global South, ultimately informing strategies to enhance human security and promote more effective governance in these rapidly growing cities."
