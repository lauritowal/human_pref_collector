        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reinterpreting how Forests Support People's Dietary Quality in Low-Income Countries\n\nNutrient deficiencies affect over 2 billion people globally, with low-income countries disproportionately affected. While increasing agricultural production and access to calories is a common solution, the role of forests in supporting dietary quality remains a blind spot. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of forests on dietary quality in low-income countries. Forests provide a range of benefits, including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which can contribute to dietary diversification. Our goal is to identify the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, develop a framework on forest-diet linkages, and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality.\n\nUsing a multi-scale, multi-country approach, we will employ a data-rich methodology to explore the relationships between forests and dietary outcomes. At the broad scale, we will analyze forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes. We will then identify hotspots where household food consumption data can be linked with forest metrics, and conduct in-depth fieldwork in two locations to elucidate the causal relationships between forests and dietary outcomes. Our project aims to contribute to a shift in food security conceptualization, recognizing the critical role of forests in supporting people's dietary quality. By highlighting the importance of forests in addressing nutrient deficiencies, this project can inform more effective and sustainable solutions to improve the health and well-being of millions of people in low-income countries.",
        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\n\nAbstract:\n\nMalnutrition and nutrient deficiencies affect over 2 billion people worldwide, with the poorest populations suffering the most. While increasing agricultural production and access to calories are often seen as the primary solutions, we argue that forests play a critical, yet overlooked, role in supporting dietary quality. Forests provide wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which can significantly enhance the nutritional content of local diets. However, forest loss and fragmentation may compromise these benefits, exacerbating dietary deficiencies.\n\nThis project aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the relationships between forests and dietary quality in low-income countries. Our multi-scale, multi-country approach will employ a data-rich methodology to identify the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, develop a framework on forest-diet linkages, and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary outcomes. We will explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes from a broad-scale perspective, identify hotspots where forest metrics are linked to household food consumption data, and conduct in-depth fieldwork in two locations to elucidate causal relationships between forests and dietary outcomes.\n\nOur project's outcome will be a paradigm shift in food security conceptualization, recognizing forests as a crucial component of sustainable and nutritious food systems. By highlighting the importance of forests in supporting dietary quality, we will inform policy and practice to better address the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations, ultimately contributing to improved health and well-being for millions of people worldwide.",

While increasing agricultural production and access to calories is often the main focus, the role of forests in supporting dietary quality remains a blind spot. Forests provide a range of benefits, including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which in turn produce meat, milk, eggs, and manure. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by identifying the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, developing a framework on forest-diet linkages, and providing empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality.\n\nUsing a multi-scale, multi-country approach, we will employ a data-rich methodology to explore the broad-scale perspective of forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes.
