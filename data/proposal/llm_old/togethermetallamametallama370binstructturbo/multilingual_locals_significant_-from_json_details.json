        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis project challenges the dominant perception of world literature as a monolingual, English-centric canon by foregrounding the multilingual locals and significant geographies that have shaped literary production and circulation. Focusing on north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, our research explores the complex dynamics of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions in these regions. We critique the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories, which have partitioned the world into discrete, nationally-bound literatures. Instead, our multilingual and located approach reveals the co-constitutive relationships between local transculturations, debates on world literature, and forms of multilingualism. By examining the appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices and trajectories in these regions, we will develop a new theoretical approach to world literature that accounts for the diversity of literary production and circulation.\n\nOur project will produce innovative methods for multilingual training and research, facilitating strategic dialogues between scholars, writers, and cultural institutions in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France. By decentring the global North and highlighting the agency of multilingual locals, we will reconfigure the map of world literature, ensuring that non-Western literatures are recognized as integral to the global canon, rather than mere supplements to it. Ultimately, our project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex, multilingual dynamics that shape world literature, enabling more inclusive and equitable literary histories.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis project reexamines the concept of world literature by moving beyond the dominant English language and Western-centric geographical frameworks. Our research focuses on multilingual locals and significant geographies in North India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, exploring how literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions shape literary production and circulation. We challenge the monolingual straitjacket and modern literary histories that partition the globe, instead adopting a multilingual and located approach to analyze local transculturations, debates on world literature, and forms of multilingualism.\n\nOur study spans three key periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. We will investigate the dynamics of appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices and trajectories in shaping literary canons. By examining the roles of actors and technologies of print and orality, we will develop a theoretical approach and methods for multilingual training and research. Our project will facilitate strategic dialogues among scholars, writers, and publishers from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France, fostering a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of world literature.\n\nUltimately, our project aims to redefine the concept of world literature, recognizing the significance of multilingual locals and geographies in shaping literary production and circulation. By doing so, we will contribute to a more diverse and equitable literary canon, reflecting the complexities of global cultural exchange and literary expression.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis project challenges the dominant perception of world literature as a monolingual, Eurocentric canon by centering multilingual locals and significant geographies. Focusing on north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, we will develop a multilingual and located approach to literary studies, critiquing the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories that partition the world into discrete, national literatures. Our research will explore the dynamics of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions in these regions during the periods of imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of local transculturations, debates on world literature, forms of multilingualism, and actors and technologies of print and orality, we will uncover the appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices and trajectories that have shaped these literary landscapes. Our project will result in a theoretical approach and methods for multilingual training and research, enabling strategic dialogues across languages and regions. By collaborating with scholars and institutions in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France, we will foster a global network of researchers committed to rethinking the boundaries and hierarchies of world literature. Ultimately, our project will provide a new framework for understanding the complex, multilingual nature of world literature, promoting a more inclusive and nuanced appreciation of literary diversity and its significance in the globalized world."
