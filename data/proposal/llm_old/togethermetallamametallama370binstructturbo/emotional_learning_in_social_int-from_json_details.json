        "Here is a 277-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying emotional learning in social interaction, with a focus on aversive learning about others, from others through observation, and during interaction. The project aims to identify the key factors involved in these processes, including stimulus-bound factors such as ethnic group belonging and emotional expressiveness, conceptual factors like moral and social status, and empathy and mental state attributions. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. We predict that our findings will implicate affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed networks, with a unique focus on the social-cognitive network for social learning and its interaction with a fourth network shaping behavioral norms.\n\nThe proposed project has significant potential to advance our understanding of group conflicts and norm compliance, while also providing insights into social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying emotional learning in social interaction, this research will contribute to the development of novel interventions aimed at improving social functioning and reducing social conflict. Ultimately, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between emotional learning and social interaction, with far-reaching implications for both basic and translational research.",

Our objectives are to identify the key factors involved in these processes, build a neural model of social-emotional learning, and explore the implications for our understanding of group conflicts, norm compliance, and psychiatric disorders such as social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy.\n\nWe will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics to investigate the stimulus-bound, conceptual, and social characteristics that influence social-emotional learning. Our predicted networks of interest include the affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed networks.\n\nA distinctive feature of our proposal is the integration of a social-cognitive network for social learning and a fourth network for social learning through interactions and shaping of behavioral norms. Our study has the potential to provide critical insights into the neural basis of social behavior, informing strategies for improving social relationships, reducing group conflicts, and developing more effective treatments for psychiatric disorders characterized by social dysfunction. By elucidating the mechanisms of emotional learning in social interaction, this project aims to make a significant impact on our understanding of human social behavior and its neural underpinnings.",

The project aims to identify the key factors involved in social-emotional learning, including stimulus-bound factors such as ethnic group belonging and emotional expressiveness, conceptual factors like moral and social status, and empathy and mental state attributions. The study will employ a range of innovative methods, including experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics.\n\nThe project predicts that four neural networks will be involved in social-emotional learning: affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed. Notably, the study will also investigate a distinctive social-cognitive network for social learning and a fourth network for social learning through interactions and shaping of behavioral norms. The proposed research has significant potential impacts, including a deeper understanding of group conflicts and norm compliance, as well as insights into social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. By elucidating the mechanisms of emotional learning in social interaction, this project can inform strategies for improving social relationships, reducing conflict, and promoting prosocial behavior."
