        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the key factors contributing to strong credit growth and the subsequent onset of banking crises. Despite the consensus that tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension is essential, there is a lack of decisive empirical evidence on the specific drivers of credit growth and their impact on financial stability. The project aims to address this knowledge gap by empirically identifying and estimating the impact of individual ingredients on loan growth, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios.\n\nUsing exceptional micro-level datasets and appropriate methodologies, this study will assess the individual and combined effects of these factors on credit growth, ensuring external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies. The project's theoretical framework will be informed by existing literature and will be developed further when necessary.\n\nBy understanding the specific drivers of credit growth and their interactions, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers and regulators seeking to mitigate the negative externalities of financial crises on the macro real sector. The project's focus on credit growth and its use of micro-level data will help to overcome the challenge of complexity in the global banking system and provide a nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to banking crises. Ultimately, this research will inform the development of more effective macroprudential policies to promote financial stability and mitigate the risk of future crises.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\nThis project aims to investigate the key factors contributing to strong credit growth and subsequent banking crises, with a focus on identifying and estimating the impact of each factor on loan growth. Despite the consensus that tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension is essential, there is a lack of decisive empirical evidence on the specific drivers of credit growth and their role in precipitating financial crises. The project will tackle this challenge by leveraging exceptional micro-level datasets and employing appropriate methodologies to empirically identify the individual ingredients that contribute to credit growth.\n\nThe proposed analysis will examine a range of factors, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios. By assessing the potential combinations of these ingredients, the project will provide a nuanced understanding of their interactions and their impact on credit growth. The project's objective is to provide a comprehensive and empirical framework for understanding the drivers of credit growth and their role in financial crises, ensuring external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project will inform policymakers and regulators on the most effective measures to mitigate the risk of financial crises, ultimately contributing to a more stable global banking system.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\nThis project aims to empirically identify and estimate the impact of various factors contributing to strong credit growth and subsequent financial crises. Despite a prevailing consensus that tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension is necessary, the empirical evidence remains lacking and decisive. The complexity of the global banking system and the scarcity of micro-level data pose significant challenges to understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\nOur project addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing the individual and combined effects of key ingredients, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios, on loan growth. We will employ appropriate methodologies and exceptional micro-level datasets to identify the impact of each factor, ensuring external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies.\n\nOur theoretical framework will be provided when missing, and we will assess the potential combinations of ingredients to understand their interactions. By focusing on credit growth, we will provide policymakers with a deeper understanding of the drivers of banking crises, enabling them to develop more effective macroprudential policies to mitigate the negative externalities from the financial sector to the macro real sector. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the development of a more stable and resilient financial system."
