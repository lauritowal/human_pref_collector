        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\n\nThis project investigates the transformative impact of social network sites (SNS) on news organizations and citizens' political behavior. As traditional news industries decline and SNS attention increases, news is becoming a social product, shaped by network logic and key actors such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees. Our research aims to explore the process of news transformation and reveal its implications for political beliefs and behavior. Using innovative approaches, including big data analysis, small-N in-depth designs, and mixed-methods research, we will study news organizations through interviews, traffic data analysis, and content analysis. We will also examine users' behavior through laboratory observation, surfing behavior measurement, and physiological attention indices. A two-year survey panel and web-based behavioral data will enable us to measure long-term political effects. This project will contribute to a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, and establish a new methodological standard for audience research. By shedding light on the new flow of news, this research will provide valuable insights into the changing landscape of news and its implications for democracy.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\n\nThis project examines the transformative impact of social network sites (SNS) on news production and consumption, and its subsequent effects on citizens' political behavior. As traditional news outlets decline and SNS attention increases, news organizations are adapting to a new network logic, where news is produced and disseminated as a social product. This project aims to explore the process of news transformation, reveal its implications, and develop a new model of news distribution, consumption, and influence.\n\nUsing innovative approaches, including big data analysis, in-depth designs, and laboratory observations, this project will study both news organizations and user behavior. We will conduct interviews with news editors, analyze traffic data and content, and measure users' surfing behavior and physiological attention indices. A two-year survey panel and web-based behavioral data will also be collected to assess the long-term effects of SNS on political beliefs and behavior.\n\nThis project's expected outcomes include a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, as well as a new methodological standard for audience research. By shedding light on the complex dynamics between SNS, news organizations, and citizens, this project will provide valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and media practitioners seeking to understand the evolving media landscape and its implications for democracy.",
        "Here is a 296-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\n\nThe rapid decline of traditional news outlets and the increasing attention to social network sites (SNS) have dramatically altered the news landscape. This project seeks to explore the transformative impact of SNS on news organizations and citizens' political behavior. We propose a comprehensive study to reveal the implications of this shift on the production, distribution, and consumption of news, as well as its long-term effects on political beliefs and behavior.\n\nOur project will employ innovative approaches, including big data analysis, laboratory observations, and in-depth interviews with news editors. We will investigate how news organizations adapt to the network logic of SNS, and how news feeders and feedees interact and influence each other. We will also examine the surfing behavior and physiological attention indices of news consumers to understand how they process and respond to news on SNS.\n\nThis two-year study will yield a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, as well as establish a new methodological standard for audience research. Our findings will have significant implications for the media industry, policymakers, and citizens, providing insights into the complex dynamics of news dissemination and its impact on democracy. By exploring the new flow of news, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between technology, media, and political behavior."
