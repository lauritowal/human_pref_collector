        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Information Services: Competition and Externalities\n\nThis project aims to advance our understanding of the economics of information services, with a focus on the strategic interactions and externalities that arise in the production and exchange of these services. The proposed research will explore the complex relationships between information services and physical infrastructures, examining the role of one-sided and two-sided network externalities, public goods, and complements. The project is divided into four parts, each tackling a distinct aspect of the problem: background theory, the virtual layer, the physical layer, and competition policy. Using a combination of theoretical development, empirical investigation, and original dynamic investment models, we will investigate topics such as recommendation systems, privacy, pricing, investment, and net-neutrality. The ultimate goal is to provide policymakers with a set of tools to promote competition and innovation in the information services sector. By shedding light on the externalities that shape this sector, this project has the potential to inform more effective regulation and foster a more efficient allocation of resources.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Information Services: Competition and Externalities\n\nThis project aims to foster knowledge of the economics of information services, with a focus on strategic interactions, production, and exchange of information services, and the role of externalities. We will investigate the characteristics of externalities, including one-sided or two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and complements of information services and physical infrastructures, at both the content and physical infrastructure levels.\n\nThe project is divided into four parts. Part 1 will establish the background theory, exploring two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities. Part 2 will examine the virtual layer, investigating recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs using empirical methods and proprietary data from e-commerce platforms. Part 3 will focus on the physical layer, analyzing pricing and investment strategies, including net-neutrality and data pricing studies. Finally, Part 4 will develop a framework for competition policy in two-sided markets.\n\nOur approach will involve developing relevant theory, conducting empirical investigations, creating original dynamic investment models, and designing tools for competition policy makers. By exploring the role of externalities in the economics of information services, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and academics, ultimately informing the development of effective competition policies that promote innovation and consumer welfare in the information services sector.",

Part 3 explores the physical layer, analyzing pricing and investment decisions in the context of net-neutrality and data pricing studies. Finally, Part 4 addresses competition policy, examining the implications of two-sided markets for regulatory frameworks.\n\nThroughout the project, we will develop relevant theory, conduct empirical investigations, and create original dynamic investment models to inform competition policy makers. The study will also explore the role of externalities, including one-sided and two-sided network effects, information as a public good, and the interplay between information services and physical infrastructures. By examining these complex issues, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the economics of information services, ultimately informing the development of effective competition policies that promote innovation and consumer welfare. This project will contribute significantly to the field, filling a crucial knowledge gap and shaping the future of information services research."
