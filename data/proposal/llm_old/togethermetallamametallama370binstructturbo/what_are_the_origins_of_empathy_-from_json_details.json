        "Here is a 282-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: What are the origins of empathy? A comparative developmental investigation\n\nThis innovative project undertakes the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, bridging the fields of biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology. Using a range of cutting-edge techniques, including thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, we will conduct longitudinal observations and innovative experiments to shed light on the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy. Our research will focus on human infants from diverse cultural backgrounds (Vanuatu and Samoa) and bonobos in both wild and semi-captive contexts.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in their motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states and possess a unique capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. Through this research, we aim to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, and advance our understanding of its origins. Our findings have the potential to challenge prevailing perspectives on human uniqueness in empathy and reveal new insights into human-unique sharing and co-operation.\n\nBy integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of empathy's origins and significance, with implications for fields such as psychology, anthropology, and conservation. Ultimately, our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of human nature and our place within the natural world.",

A Comparative Developmental Investigation\n\nThis innovative project seeks to uncover the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy by conducting the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos. Using cutting-edge techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, we will employ longitudinal observations and innovative experiments to examine empathy in both species. Our study will take place in diverse contexts, including human infant cultures in Vanuatu and Samoa, and bonobo populations in wild and semi-captive settings. By exploring empathy in the context of distributed-caregiving societal structures, we aim to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, and advance our understanding of empathy's origins. Our hypotheses suggest that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but diverge in motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states, and that humans have a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. This project has the potential to yield groundbreaking outcomes, including the discovery of human-unique sharing and cooperation behaviors. By integrating insights from biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, this project will challenge prevailing perspectives on human uniqueness in empathy and make significant contributions to our understanding of this essential human capacity."
