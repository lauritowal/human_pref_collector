        "Title: STONECULT: Uncovering the Origins of Human Culture through the Lens of Early Stone Tools\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe emergence of culture is a pivotal milestone in human evolution, yet the timing and mechanisms underlying this development remain unclear. The STONECULT project tackles this pressing question by investigating whether early stone tools, a hallmark of hominin innovation, reflect cumulative culture or alternative learning mechanisms. Current assumptions suggest that early stone tools arose from high-fidelity copying, but our novel approach proposes the \"latent solutions model,\" which posits that early hominins relied on inherent problem-solving abilities rather than social learning.\n\nThrough a combination of top-down and bottom-up testing, we will compare early stone tools to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, evaluating whether these ancient tools demonstrate cumulative culture or latent solutions. Our hypotheses predict that early stone tools will not exhibit characteristics of cumulative culture, instead supporting the latent solutions model. If confirmed, this finding would revolutionize our understanding of human culture evolution, suggesting that cumulative culture emerged later than currently thought.\n\nSTONECULT's innovative approach has far-reaching implications for fields including anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. By shedding new light on the origins of human culture, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of what makes us human.",
        "Here is a 303-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: STONECULT: Investigating the Origins of Culture through Early Stone Tools\n\nThe emergence of culture is a pivotal question in the scientific community, with significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and colonization of the planet. The STONECULT project proposes to investigate the origins of culture by examining the earliest stone tools created by hominins. Current theories suggest that early hominin technology relied on high-fidelity copying, leading to the accumulation of cultural knowledge. However, an alternative explanation, the latent solutions model, posits that early stone tools were the result of individual problem-solving rather than cultural transmission.\n\nThis project aims to test these competing hypotheses through a comprehensive, multi-method approach, combining top-down and bottom-up testing. By comparing early stone tools to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, we will determine whether these tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions. The results of this study will have significant implications for our understanding of human cultural evolution, informing fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology.\n\nIf the latent solutions model is confirmed, it will challenge the current assumption that cumulative culture emerged early in human evolution, instead suggesting that it arose later. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of human culture evolution, providing new insights into the origins of our species' unique capacity for cultural adaptation. As the first study to test the latent solutions account of early stone tools, STONECULT offers a groundbreaking opportunity to reassess the foundations of human culture.",
        "Here is a 303-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture? (STONECULT)\n\nThe origin of human culture is a pressing scientific question, with cultural adaptations critical for human colonization of the planet. The STONECULT project seeks to address this question by investigating whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions. Current theories suggest that early hominin technology may not have relied on the same social learning mechanisms as modern humans, and the latent solutions model may better explain early hominin stone tools than high-fidelity copying.\n\nThis project will test two hypotheses: that early stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture (null hypothesis), and that early stone tools are best accounted for by the latent solutions model. To achieve this, we will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, comparing early stone tools to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches.\n\nThe potential impact of this project is significant, informing fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. If the latent solutions model is confirmed, it would suggest that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, transforming our understanding of human culture evolution. This proposal is the first to test the new latent solutions account of early stone tools, offering a novel perspective on the origins of human culture. By investigating the roots of human culture, STONECULT aims to shed new light on a fundamental aspect of human evolution and its significance for our species' success."
