        "Here is a 299-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach\n\nThis project aims to investigate the evolutionary origins of friendship, a crucial aspect of human health and well-being, with significant implications for public health and political policy. Social isolation, a growing concern, is linked to increased risks of heart disease and other negative outcomes, comparable to those associated with heavy smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity. To address this issue, our research will employ a cross-species comparison and experimental approach to explore the evolutionary roots of friendship.\n\nFocusing on nonhuman primates, specifically macaques, we will create a comprehensive dataset to investigate the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species. We will also conduct social experiments to establish whether humans possess a unique ability to gather information about the friendships of unrelated others. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that social isolation results from competitive exclusion.\n\nOur research has three primary aims: (1) to identify the environmental forces shaping social bonds across species, (2) to determine whether humans possess a unique ability to understand the friendships of others, and (3) to investigate the role of competitive exclusion in social isolation. By achieving these aims, we will gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary perspective on friendship, ultimately informing strategies to mitigate social isolation and promote healthy relationships.",

Social isolation, a growing concern in modern societies, is linked to increased risks of heart disease and other health problems, with effects comparable to those of heavy smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity. To better understand the roots of friendship, we will conduct a cross-species comparison and experimental approach, focusing on nonhuman primates, particularly macaques. Our three aims are to: (1) test environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species, (2) establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill, and (3) test whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion. By analyzing a cross-species dataset and conducting social experiments, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary perspective of friendship. Our expected outcome is a deeper understanding of what it means to be human, shedding light on the importance of social connections for our well-being. Ultimately, this project will inform strategies for mitigating social isolation and promoting healthy social relationships, with far-reaching benefits for human health and society.",

Social isolation, a growing concern in modern society, is linked to increased risks of heart disease, comparable to those associated with heavy smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity. To address this issue, our research will employ a cross-species comparison and experimental approach to uncover the evolutionary forces driving the development of friendship.\n\nOur study will focus on nonhuman primates, specifically macaques, to explore the evolutionary origins of human specializations in friendship. We will collect a comprehensive cross-species dataset and conduct social experiments to test three key aims: (1) the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species, (2) whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill, and (3) whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion.\n\nBy achieving these aims, our project will provide a fundamental understanding of the evolutionary perspective of friendship, shedding light on what it means to be human. The outcomes of this research will have significant implications for the development of interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of social isolation, ultimately contributing to improved human health and well-being."
