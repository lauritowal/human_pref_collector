        "Here is a 287-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Portable EEG-based Screening of Social Predispositions in Newborns\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to develop a portable, wireless EEG-based device for rapid and automatic screening of face processing in newborns, enabling early identification of those at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The device will utilize a novel oscillatory visual presentation paradigm, requiring less than 2 minutes of visual attention, and dry electrodes to ensure comfort and ease of use. An automatic on-line extraction algorithm will facilitate rapid data analysis.\n\nThe proposed device addresses a significant market gap, as no fully portable EEG system for newborns is currently available. Our innovative technology features a low-power, wireless design, enabling testing in various settings, including at home. This project has the potential to revolutionize ASD diagnosis and treatment by facilitating early behavioral intervention and large-scale screening protocols.\n\nThe proposed EEG-based index of face processing will provide an objective biomarker for newborns at risk, enabling timely and targeted interventions. This project's impact will extend beyond ASD diagnosis, informing research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions in infants. By merging cutting-edge experimental design with portable EEG technology, our device will transform the field of developmental neuroscience and improve outcomes for infants and families worldwide.",
