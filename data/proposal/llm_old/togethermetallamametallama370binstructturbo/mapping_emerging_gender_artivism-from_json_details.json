        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE (MEGAMAPS)\n\nThis innovative research project, MEGAMAPS, seeks to investigate the intersection of art, activism, and gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, focusing on the post-2011 uprising period. Through a transnational, in-depth study, we will explore the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change in four countries: Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. By combining History, Social Movements Theory, Gender studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities methodologies, we will produce a comprehensive, participative digital platform that documents and systematizes a corpus of living sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools. Our objectives are to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region, write a history from below, and provide the first research platform for Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region. The project's outputs will be disseminated through targeted activities, aiming to improve activists' participation in transnational networks, promote mutual exchanges of best practices, and contribute to reversing victimization paradigms on women and sexual minorities. The project's open access, participative digital platform will ensure FAIR accessibility to academics, stakeholders, and the general public, promoting a more nuanced understanding of gender artivism in the Mediterranean Arab public space.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE (MEGAMAPS)\n\nThis transnational, interdisciplinary project investigates the intersection of art, activism, and gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space after 2011. MEGAMAPS combines historical, social movement, gender, and visual arts perspectives with digital humanities methodologies to map emerging artivism for gender equality in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Our objectives are to innovate global academic knowledge, write a history from below, and explore the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change. We will achieve this through fieldwork, digital ethnography, and the creation of an open-access, participative digital platform documenting and systematizing a corpus of living sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools. By providing a first-of-its-kind research platform, we aim to promote mutual exchanges of best practices, contribute to reversing victimization paradigms, and propose an agency paradigm to overcome orientalism and islamophobia. Our dissemination activities will target academics, stakeholders, and the general public, promoting a deeper understanding of artivism's role in advancing gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab region.",

The project will conduct fieldwork and digital ethnography in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, collecting and analyzing a diverse corpus of living sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools.\n\nThe project's key objective is to create an open-access, participative digital platform for research and exchange, making the corpus FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders, and the general public. This platform will serve as a hub for documenting and systematizing living sources, promoting mutual exchanges of best practices, and reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities. By doing so, MEGAMAPS will contribute to overcoming orientalism and islamophobia, providing a unique agency paradigm for understanding the Arab region. Through its innovative approach, MEGAMAPS will make a significant impact on the academic community, civil society, and the broader public, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between artivism, gender equality, and social change in the Mediterranean Arab public space."
