        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation (PRINCIPLES)\n\nThe PRINCIPLES project addresses two of humanity's most pressing challenges: global warming and Covid-19. At their core, these problems require individuals to act in the collective interest, yet current models of cooperation focus on only one narrow aspect, neglecting the complexity of human behavior. To overcome this limitation, PRINCIPLES adopts an integrated, interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology.\n\nThe project's ambition is to establish a unified science of human cooperation, with a key focus on the concept of rule following. To achieve this, we will develop a comprehensive model of cooperation, experimentally test behavioral principles, investigate links between these principles, and analyze models of social dilemmas. Our objectives are to explain behavior in large-scale cooperation problems, such as climate care, and provide researchers and policymakers with the tools and data needed to study cooperation across disciplines.\n\nUsing novel, experimentally tested frameworks and incentivized experiments in representative samples, PRINCIPLES will equip its target audience of researchers and policymakers with a deeper understanding of human cooperation. By doing so, this project will inform evidence-based policies and interventions that promote collective action in the face of global challenges. Ultimately, PRINCIPLES aims to provide a transformative understanding of human cooperation, enabling us to address the complex problems that threaten our collective well-being.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation (PRINCIPLES)\n\nThe proposed project, PRINCIPLES, aims to develop a unified science of human cooperation to tackle pressing global challenges, including climate change and pandemics like Covid-19. Current models of cooperation are limited in their focus on narrow aspects, neglecting the complexity of real-world problems. To address this, PRINCIPLES will adopt an integrated research approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology.\n\nThe project's central concept is \"rule following,\" which will be explored through a comprehensive model of cooperation, experimentally tested behavioural principles, and an analysis of social dilemmas. Our objectives are to develop a novel, experimentally tested framework for studying cooperation, investigate the behavioural links between principles, and explain behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems.\n\nUsing incentivised experiments in representative samples, we will equip researchers and policy makers with behavioural principles, tools, and data to study cooperation problems. The project's target problems include climate care, and its findings will inform evidence-based policy interventions. By providing a unified understanding of human cooperation, PRINCIPLES will contribute to the development of effective solutions to global challenges. Ultimately, this project will foster a deeper understanding of how individuals can act in the collective interest, promoting a more cooperative and sustainable future.",
        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation (PRINCIPLES)\n\nThe PRINCIPLES project tackles the pressing global challenges of climate change and pandemics, such as Covid-19, by understanding the fundamental principles of human cooperation. Current models of cooperation are limited by their focus on narrow aspects, neglecting the complexity of real-world problems. To address this, we will develop an integrated, interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology. Our ambition is to establish a unified science of human cooperation, centered on the key concept of rule following. The project's objectives are to: (1) develop a comprehensive model of cooperation, (2) experimentally test behavioural principles, (3) investigate links between principles, (4) analyze models of social dilemmas, and (5) explain behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems. We will employ incentivized experiments in representative samples to test our novel framework. The PRINCIPLES project will equip researchers and policy makers with the behavioural principles, tools, and data needed to study cooperation problems across disciplines. Our target problem is climate care, and our findings will inform evidence-based policies to address this critical issue. By advancing our understanding of human cooperation, PRINCIPLES will contribute to a more sustainable and cooperative future."
