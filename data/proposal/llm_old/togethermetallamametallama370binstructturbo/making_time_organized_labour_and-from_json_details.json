        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\n\nThis project, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\", aims to promote work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe by examining the role of organized labour in shaping social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time. The project focuses on the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections, with a particular emphasis on the predominance of women in caregiving and union membership. Using a mixed-method research design, the project will conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses across rich democracies from 1965 onwards, with in-depth case studies in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. The study will investigate the influence mechanisms of trade unions on care leave policies, including child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits, in different institutional settings. By advancing comparative labour studies and developing theories of union-policy relationships, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of organized labour in promoting sustainable work policies. The project will also develop a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions, allowing for a thorough outcome assessment of organized labour's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies.",
        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\n\nThis project explores the critical role of organized labour in promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe. Focusing on the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections, we examine how trade unions have shaped social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time. We highlight the gendered dimension of caregiving, as women disproportionately bear caregiving responsibilities and are also more likely to be union members. \n\nUsing a mixed-method research design, we combine quantitative analysis of rich democracies from 1965 onwards with qualitative analysis of Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. Our policy focus includes child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. We investigate the mechanisms through which unions influence policy development and implementation, comparing different institutional settings. \n\nThis interdisciplinary project draws on comparative policy analysis and social movement research to advance our understanding of union-policy relationships. We aim to develop a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions and assess the outcomes of organized labour's partnerships in developing sustainable work policies. By examining the complex interplay between labour movements, policy innovation, and care work, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of the politics of care leave and its implications for promoting work-life balance in Europe.",
        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the critical role of organized labour in promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe, with a focus on care-related leave rights and protections. Despite the importance of social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time, existing research has overlooked the crucial intersection of trade unions, gender, and caregiving. This mixed-method study will employ quantitative analysis of rich democracies since 1965 and qualitative analysis of Ireland, France, and the Netherlands to examine the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections. The project will investigate the influence mechanisms of trade unions in shaping care leave policies, including child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. By comparing different institutional settings and drawing on interdisciplinary fields of comparative policy analysis and social movement research, this project aims to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships. The project's ambition is to create a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions and assess the outcome of organized labour's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between organized labour, caregiving, and policy innovation, informing strategies to promote work-life balance and sustainable work practices in Europe."
