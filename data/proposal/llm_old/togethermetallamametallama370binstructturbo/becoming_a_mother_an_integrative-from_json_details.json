        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period\n\nThis prospective longitudinal study aims to develop an integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period. We will recruit three groups of nulliparous women: those undergoing full-term pregnancy, those whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy, and control nulliparous women. Over five time points, we will collect neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data to establish when brain changes begin in pregnant women and how they evolve. We will characterize the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, and assess the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors on maternal adaptations. Additionally, we will identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations and integrate our findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.\n\nOur study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex adaptations that occur during the transition to motherhood, shedding light on the underlying neural and psychological mechanisms. The deliverables of this study will include a longitudinal RDoC-based model, intermediate longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sectional analyses. The results of this study will have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of perinatal psychiatric disorders and will inform the development of targeted interventions to support maternal mental health. By elucidating the complex adaptations that occur during the transition to motherhood, this study will ultimately improve maternal and infant outcomes.",

        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period\n\nThis prospective longitudinal study aims to develop a comprehensive, integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period. We will recruit three groups of nulliparous women: those undergoing full-term pregnancy, those whose same-sex partners are pregnant, and control women. Over five time points, including pre-pregnancy, intra-pregnancy, and postpartum sessions, we will collect neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data to investigate the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures. We will also examine the impact of environmental and psychological factors on maternal adaptations and identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations. Our study will integrate findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex processes involved in becoming a mother. The project's deliverables will include a longitudinal RDoC-based model, intermediate longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sectional analyses. This study has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of maternal adaptations and inform the development of targeted interventions to support mothers' mental and emotional well-being during the critical period of pregnancy and postpartum."
