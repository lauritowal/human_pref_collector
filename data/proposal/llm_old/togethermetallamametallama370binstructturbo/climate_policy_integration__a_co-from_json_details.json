        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nThe European Union's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is projected to be missed due to poorly coordinated policy regimes. Despite growing policy complexity, existing theories fail to explain why policy integration processes remain ineffective. This project addresses this knowledge gap by developing a new theory on policy integration, focusing on the lack of system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies. \n\nWe will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative modeling of policy interdependencies, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, and comparative case studies to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, and identify system-level solutions. Our comparative analysis will focus on coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration in the EU and selected member states.\n\nThis project aims to provide insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the debate beyond climate policy. By addressing the complexity trap, we can inform more effective policy reforms and support the EU's transition to a low-carbon economy.",
        "Here is a 280-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nThe European Union's projected failure to meet its 2050 net-zero target underscores the urgent need to understand and address the shortcomings of climate policy integration. The proposed project, CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?, aims to develop a new theory explaining why growing policy regimes remain poorly coordinated. Despite the increasing complexity of climate policies, there is a lack of system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies, adequate theories, and study methods. This project will address these gaps by employing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative modeling of policy interdependencies, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, and comparative case studies. The project's objectives are to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, identify system-level solutions, and simulate policy reforms. A comparative analysis of the EU and selected member states will focus on coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The expected outcomes of this project are insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the debate beyond climate policy. The researcher's expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes ensures a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between policy actors and instruments.",
        "Here is a 280-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nThe European Union's aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 is compromised by poorly coordinated policy regimes, hindering effective climate action. Despite growing policy complexity, existing theories and methods fail to provide a system-level understanding of policy integration processes. This project addresses this knowledge gap by developing a new theory to explain the persistence of policy fragmentation.\n\nOur research focuses on the lack of a comprehensive picture of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies, inadequate theories, and limited study methods. We will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative modeling of policy interdependencies, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, and comparative case studies to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, and identify system-level solutions. A comparative analysis of the EU and selected member states will examine coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the debate beyond climate policy. By simulating policy reforms, we will provide actionable recommendations for policymakers to overcome the complexity trap and achieve more effective climate governance. With the researcher's expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, this project is well-positioned to drive innovation in policy integration research and support evidence-based climate policy in the EU."
