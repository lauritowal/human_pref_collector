        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDE)\n\nThe WIDE project challenges the dominant Western linguistic thinking that has shaped our understanding of language, particularly in the context of literacy training, which begins in early childhood. This approach is rooted in the 3,000-year-old invention of the alphabet, which has led to a focus on phone and word-based language processing. In contrast, the WIDE project seeks to explore language understanding beyond this limited scope. We will develop a novel, wide learning network that mimics the human brain's ability to process language, leveraging the unique features of the Chinese writing system, such as character spacing, context dependency, and syllable-based representation.\n\nOur two-layer network, comprising many thousands of units, will employ a simple, error-driven learning rule to match human processing strengths and weaknesses. By moving beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches, we aim to advance our research program in four key areas: auditory comprehension development, modeling diverse languages, speech production extension, and discrimination-based language theory development. The WIDE project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of language, contributing to the growing fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We request funding to support this innovative research, which promises to break new ground in language understanding and processing.",
        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDE)\n\nThe WIDE project challenges the dominant alphabet-centric approach to language understanding by exploring the role of low-level acoustic signal properties in reducing uncertainty about spoken messages. Despite the 50,000-year history of human language, our understanding of language processing remains largely tied to Western linguistic thinking and the 3,000-year-old invention of the alphabet. This project seeks to break free from this constraint by developing a novel approach to language understanding that goes beyond phone and word-based methods.\n\nUsing wide learning networks with thousands of units and a simplest possible error-driven learning rule, we aim to create a two-layer network that matches human processing strengths and weaknesses. This innovative approach will enable the development of models that can handle diverse languages, including those with unique features such as Chinese, which uses juxtaposed characters without intervening spaces and relies on context-dependent syllable representation.\n\nThe WIDE project will advance our research program in several key areas, including auditory comprehension development, modeling diverse languages, speech production extension, and discrimination-based language theory development. By exploring the uncharted territory of acoustic signal-based language understanding, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human language processing and contribute significantly to the current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We request funding to support this groundbreaking research.",
        "Here is a 269-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Wide Incremental Learning with Discrimination Networks (WILDNet)\n\nThe WILDNet project challenges the dominant alphabet-centric approach to language understanding by exploring the role of low-level acoustic signal properties in reducing uncertainty about spoken messages. Despite the significance of language in human society, our understanding of its fundamental processes remains limited by Western linguistic thinking and the assumption that language is based on phones and words. This project seeks to break free from these constraints by developing a novel, wide incremental learning framework that leverages discrimination networks to model language understanding.\n\nOur approach draws inspiration from the unique characteristics of the Chinese writing system, which juxtaposes characters without intervening spaces and relies on context-dependent syllables rather than individual letters. By employing two-layer networks with thousands of units, we will investigate how simple, error-driven learning rules can give rise to human-like language processing strengths and weaknesses. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of language development, particularly in the areas of auditory comprehension, speech production, and language theory. Furthermore, our project will contribute to the growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence research programs. We request funding to support this innovative project, which promises to revolutionize the field of language understanding and open up new avenues for linguistic research."
