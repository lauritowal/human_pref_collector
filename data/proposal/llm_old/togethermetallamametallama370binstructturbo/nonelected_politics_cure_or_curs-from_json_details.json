        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Non-elected politics. Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\n\nThe crisis of representative democracy in Europe is characterized by growing citizen disengagement, historically low electoral turnout, and declining trust in institutions. In response, institutional reforms have sought to revitalize democracy by delegating decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts. However, this approach raises a paradox: does delegating power to non-elected actors contradict the fundamental principle of elected control in representative democracy? This project investigates the effects of such delegation on support for representative democracy, exploring the central hypothesis that non-elected politics has no universal effect. Through a mixed-methods approach combining online survey experiments and panel surveys, we will conduct a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, and compile a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000. Our analysis will examine the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy, providing far-reaching insights into the potential of institutional reforms to address the crisis of representative democracy.",

In response, institutional reforms aimed at revitalizing democracy have led to the delegation of political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts. This project investigates the effects of such non-elected politics on the crisis of representative democracy. Paradoxically, delegating decision-making powers contradicts the tenet of elected control, raising questions about its impact on support for representative democracy.\n\nThis study posits that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, create a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and analyze the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy. Our research methods will include online survey experiments and panel surveys.\n\nThe far-reaching societal implications of this research are significant, as it will provide insights into the potential of non-elected politics to revitalize or exacerbate the crisis of representative democracy. By exploring the effects of delegating decision-making powers to citizens and experts, this project will inform policymakers and scholars about the most effective strategies to address the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of more responsive, inclusive, and effective democratic institutions.",

Online survey experiments and panel surveys will be employed to collect data and test the central hypothesis. The project's far-reaching societal implications lie in its potential to inform evidence-based reforms that can strengthen or revitalize representative democracy in Europe. By shedding light on the consequences of delegating decision-making powers to non-elected actors, this project can contribute to a more informed and effective response to the crisis of representative democracy."
