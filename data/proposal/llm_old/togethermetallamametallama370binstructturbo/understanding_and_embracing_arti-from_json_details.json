        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families (F-AI-MILY)\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project seeks to investigate the impact of artificial agents on family social dynamics, bringing together expertise from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. The project's primary objectives are to establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach, describe developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents, and identify how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can support households with chronic illness.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will develop a group-centred mobile lab to study social dynamics impacted by artificial agents, measuring behavioral and brain measures of attitudes and behaviors of family members. The project will also test the impact of child development interaction with artificial agents and the long-term effects of living with an artificial agent on families with children aged 4-12. Furthermore, the project will guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households.\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project aims to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, and to change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness. The project's interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, and full-circle approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of artificial agents on family social dynamics, ultimately informing the development of artificial agents that support and benefit families.",
        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families (F-AI-MILY)\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project seeks to investigate the impact of artificial agents on family social dynamics, bringing together insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. This interdisciplinary research aims to establish a new group-centred mobile-lab approach to study family neurocognition and describe developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents. Specifically, the project will identify how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can support households with chronic illness.\n\nUsing a novel mobile lab, we will measure behavioral and brain measures of attitudes and behaviors of family members, testing child development interactions with artificial agents and their long-term effects on families with children aged 4-12. Our approach will guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households. The project's overarching aims are to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, and to change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness.\n\nBy adopting a neurocognition-at-home approach, we will collect data in real-world settings, ensuring ecological validity and generalizability. Our \"full circle\" approach will integrate findings from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction to inform the development of artificial agents that support healthy social dynamics in families. The F-AI-MILY project has the potential to transform our understanding of artificial agents' impact on family social dynamics, ultimately improving the well-being of families, particularly those coping with chronic illness.",
        "Here is a 278-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families (F-AI-MILY)\n\nThe increasing presence of artificial agents in family homes has the potential to significantly impact social dynamics, yet little is known about these effects. The F-AI-MILY project aims to address this knowledge gap by integrating insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. This interdisciplinary study will employ a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to investigate the impact of artificial agents on family social dynamics, with a focus on developmental changes in children aged 4-12. \n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: (1) to establish a new mobile-lab approach for studying family neurocognition, (2) to describe developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents, and (3) to identify how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can support households with chronic illness. The proposed methods include developing a mobile lab, measuring behavioural and brain measures of attitudes and behaviours, and testing the long-term effects of living with an artificial agent on families. \n\nThe ultimate goals of F-AI-MILY are to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, and to change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness. By providing a comprehensive understanding of artificial agents' impact on family social dynamics, this project will inform the development of artificial agents that support vulnerable households, ultimately improving the well-being of families worldwide."
