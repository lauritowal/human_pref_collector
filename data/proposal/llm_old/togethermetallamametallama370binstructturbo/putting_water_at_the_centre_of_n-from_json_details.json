        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History: NUCLEARWATERS\n\nThis project, NUCLEARWATERS, proposes a paradigm-shifting approach to the history of nuclear energy by reframing it as a history of water. Challenging traditional narratives, we argue that nuclear energy is fundamentally a hydraulic technology, rooted in centuries of hydraulic engineering and the development of hydraulic civilizations. Through a comprehensive and interdisciplinary investigation, we will examine the historical water-manipulating technologies and conceptions of wet and dry risks that have shaped the nuclear industry.\n\nOur hypothesis is that a water-centred history will resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history, providing a more nuanced understanding of the sector's development and its environmental and social implications. The project is structured into six work packages, each exploring a distinct theme: the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nBy revising nuclear energy history through a water-centric lens, this project aims to make significant contributions to the fields of history of technology and environmental history. Furthermore, its findings will inform and enrich the public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond, providing a more informed and nuanced understanding of the sector's past, present, and future. Ultimately, NUCLEARWATERS seeks to transform our understanding of nuclear energy, highlighting the critical role of water in its development and operation.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History (NUCLEARWATERS)\n\nThis innovative project, NUCLEARWATERS, challenges the conventional understanding of nuclear energy history by reframing it as a history of water. We argue that nuclear energy is, in essence, a hydraulic technology, and its development is deeply intertwined with centuries of hydraulic engineering and the emergence of hydraulic civilizations. Through a comprehensive investigation of historical water-manipulating technologies and contrasting wet and dry risk conceptions, we will demonstrate that a water-centred approach resolves key riddles in nuclear energy history.\n\nThe project is structured around six work packages, each exploring a distinct theme: the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region. By examining these diverse contexts, we will revise the history of nuclear energy, highlighting the critical role of water in its development, operation, and risks.\n\nThe ambition of NUCLEARWATERS is to transform our understanding of nuclear energy history, with far-reaching implications for the history of technology, environmental history, and public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. By placing water at the centre of nuclear energy history, this project will provide a fresh perspective on the complex relationships between technology, environment, and society, ultimately informing more sustainable and responsible nuclear energy policies.",
        "Here is a 293-word abstract for a grant proposal based on the provided JSON details:\n\nTitle: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History (NUCLEARWATERS)\n\nThis innovative project, NUCLEARWATERS, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of nuclear energy by reframing its history as a history of water. By arguing that nuclear energy is, at its core, a hydraulic technology, we aim to resolve key riddles in the field and provide a new perspective on the development of nuclear energy.\n\nBuilding on centuries of hydraulic engineering and the legacy of hydraulic civilizations, this project will investigate two primary areas: historical water-manipulating technologies and the contrasting conceptions of wet and dry risk. Through six interconnected work packages, we will explore the themes of nuclear-hydraulic engineering communities, Soviet Union nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nOur hypothesis is that a water-centred history of nuclear energy will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the field, resolving long-standing puzzles and shedding new light on the interplay between technology, environment, and society. By revising the history of nuclear energy, this project will have significant implications for the fields of history of technology and environmental history, as well as informing public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. Ultimately, NUCLEARWATERS aims to transform our understanding of nuclear energy, highlighting the critical role of water in shaping its past, present, and future."
