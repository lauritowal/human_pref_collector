        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Everyday Politics of Famine\n\nAbstract:\n\nFamines are increasingly frequent and deadly, with 250,000 people experiencing famine in 2022 and 35 million on the edge of famine. Despite this alarming trend, the root causes of famine persistence remain poorly understood. This project, \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining the everyday politics of famine in communities. Through an ethnographically-informed comparative study in South Sudan and Somalia, our research team will investigate why famines persist, how the science of famine politics is shifting, and how blame is displaced for famine suffering. Our Somali and South Sudanese-dominated research team, with previous experience, established networks, and a track record of carefully built capacity, is well-positioned to conduct this research. The project's four research strands will explore histories and musical memories of past famine, community narratives that enforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. By shedding light on the complex social and political dynamics underlying famine, this project aims to contribute to a critical shift in the science of famine politics and inform more effective responses to this pressing global issue.",
        "Here is a 301-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Everyday Politics of Famine\n\nFamines are increasingly frequent and deadly, with 250,000 people experiencing famine in 2022 and 35 million more on the brink of catastrophe. Despite these alarming statistics, the persistence of famines remains poorly understood. This project, \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining the everyday politics of famine in communities affected by these crises.\n\nThrough an ethnographically-informed comparative study, our research will focus on South Sudan and Somalia, two countries that have experienced devastating famines in recent years. Our Somali and South Sudanese-dominated research team, with its extensive experience, networks, and carefully built capacity, is well-positioned to undertake this critical research.\n\nOur research goals are fourfold: to understand why famines persist, to shift the science of famine politics, to normalize the study of new deadly famines, and to illuminate how blame is displaced for famine suffering. To achieve these goals, we will explore four research strands: the histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives that enforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics.\n\nBy examining the everyday politics of famine, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that underlie these crises. Our research will provide critical insights for policymakers, practitioners, and communities affected by famines, ultimately informing more effective responses to these devastating events.",

Our Somali and South Sudanese-dominated research team brings extensive experience, networks, and a carefully built capacity to the project, ensuring a nuanced and context-specific understanding of famine politics. By centering the voices and experiences of those most affected by famine, this project aims to contribute to a critical rethinking of famine politics and inform more effective responses to this pressing global issue."
