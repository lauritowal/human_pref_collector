        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nThis transdisciplinary research project examines the complex relationships between theatre, politics, and national identity in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a combination of theoretical and ethnographic research methods, this study will investigate how theatre reflects and shapes the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporic communities. Five case studies will be conducted, focusing on theatre productions that involve Armenians after the Genocide, queer dramas, Islamic theatre, Sephardic Jewish theatre, and Alevi theatre.\n\nThe research objectives are to: (1) analyze the role of theatre in constituting 'the Turkish nation' and its Others; (2) provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government; (3) critically examine the role of theatre in the politics of belonging in the nation-state; (4) explore the relationship between artistic performance and everyday citizenship; (5) advance understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe; and (6) offer insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.\n\nThis project will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, shedding light on the ways in which theatre reflects and challenges dominant narratives of national identity, belonging, and citizenship. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersections between art, politics, and identity in Turkey and its diasporas, with implications for the study of theatre, politics, and cultural policy in diverse national and transnational contexts.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nThis transdisciplinary research project examines the role of theatre in shaping national identity, belonging, and politics in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a combination of theoretical and ethnographic methods, this study will investigate how theatre reflects and influences the construction of \"the Turkish nation\" and its Others, including Armenians, LGBTQ+ individuals, Islamic, Sephardic Jewish, and Alevi communities. The project's case studies will explore the ways in which theatre productions negotiate identity, sexuality, and national belonging in Turkey and its diasporas in Europe and Israel. By analyzing the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government, this research will provide critical insights into the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. Ultimately, this project aims to advance our understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts, and the role of theatre in illiberal democracies.",
