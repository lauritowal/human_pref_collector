        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance: Organizational Circumstances Under Which Data Analysts and Medical Experts Follow or Deviate from AI\n\nThis multi-sited ethnographic study investigates the socio-cultural context of big data/AI-informed national health governance, focusing on the organizational circumstances that influence human collaboration with AI agents. Despite the increasing reliance on AI systems in healthcare, there is a significant research gap in understanding the dynamics of human-AI interaction and the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making. This project aims to address this gap by analyzing moments of human intervention with AI in six national settings, developing a theory on organizational factors that promote ethical AI, and using future-scenarioing anthropological methods to connect anthropological insights with AI development. By partnering with health decision-makers and policy institutions, this study will provide empirical evidence on when and why data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI recommendations, shedding light on the complex interplay between AI systems, organizational culture, and human decision-making. The expected impact of this project is significant, with the potential to inform national health policies and improve individual human lives by ensuring that AI is developed and used in ways that prioritize ethical considerations and human well-being.",
        "Here is a 271-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance: Understanding Organizational Circumstances of AI Adoption\n\nThis multi-sited ethnographic study investigates the organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI recommendations in national health governance. Despite the increasing reliance on big data and AI systems, there is a significant gap in understanding the socio-cultural context of AI adoption and the dynamics of human-AI collaboration. This project addresses this gap by analyzing moments of human intervention with AI in six national settings, with a focus on algorithmic ethics and the development of ethical AI. \n\nUsing innovative anthropological methods, including future-scenarioing, this study aims to develop a theory on organizational factors that facilitate ethical AI adoption. The research will provide empirically-grounded insights into the ways in which organizational contexts shape AI adoption and, in turn, impact national health policies and individual human lives. \n\nThrough partnerships with health decision-makers and policy institutions, this project will ensure that its findings inform policy and practice, ultimately contributing to more effective and equitable national health governance. By connecting anthropological insights with AI development, this study has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of AI systems that are responsive to human values and needs.",

Despite the increasing reliance on big data and AI systems in healthcare decision-making, there is a critical lack of understanding of the socio-cultural context and organizational factors that influence human intervention with AI. This project addresses these research gaps by analyzing moments of human intervention with AI in six national settings, using innovative anthropological methods, including future-scenarioing approaches. The study aims to develop a theory on the organizational factors that facilitate ethical AI use in healthcare governance and to inform the development of AI systems that are sensitive to human values and needs. By partnering with health decision-makers and policy institutions, this project expects to have a significant impact on national health policies and, ultimately, on individual human lives. The project's findings will provide critical insights into the ways in which AI can be designed and implemented to support equitable, transparent, and accountable healthcare decision-making, ultimately improving health outcomes and promoting trust in AI-driven healthcare systems."
