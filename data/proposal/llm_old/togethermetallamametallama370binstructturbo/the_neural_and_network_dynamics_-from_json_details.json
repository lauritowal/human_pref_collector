        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\nAdolescence is a critical period of development, marked by significant changes in social behavior, academic achievement, and risk-taking tendencies. Social influence plays a profound role in shaping these behaviors, yet the underlying neural and network mechanisms remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap by developing a new theoretical framework and formalizing novel computational models to elucidate the dynamics of social influence across adolescence.\n\nThe proposed research will focus on the amplification of social influence through social media and viral risk-taking challenges, which have become increasingly prevalent among adolescents. By recognizing adolescents as active information seekers, our study will employ innovative tasks, computational models, and functional magnetic imaging to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying social learning. We will also conduct an experimental study within real peer social networks, incorporating social network analyses to examine the spread of social information.\n\nOur research aims to answer fundamental questions about when to search for social information and who to learn from, shedding light on the role of social information in adolescent behavior and advancing our understanding of social learning mechanisms. The expected outcomes of this project will provide valuable insights into the neural and network dynamics of social influence, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to promote prosocial behavior and academic achievement among adolescents.",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\nAdolescence is a critical period of development, marked by significant changes in academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. Social influence plays a pivotal role in shaping these outcomes, yet the underlying neural and network mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project aims to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models to elucidate the dynamics of social influence across adolescence.\n\nWe will investigate how adolescents actively seek and integrate social information, particularly in the context of social media and viral risk-taking challenges. Our research questions focus on when to search for social information and who to learn from, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between neural and network factors. To address these questions, we will develop novel tasks, employ advanced computational models, and leverage functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) and social network analyses.\n\nOur innovative approach builds on several key novelties, including the consideration of adolescents as active information seekers, the development of novel tasks, and the integration of computational models with fMRI and social network analyses. By studying real peer social networks, we will gain insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advance our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and inform the development of interventions to promote positive outcomes. Ultimately, this project has the potential to transform our understanding of adolescent development and inform evidence-based strategies to support healthy growth and well-being.",
        "Here is a 292-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\nAdolescence is a critical period of development, marked by significant changes in social behavior, academic achievement, and risk-taking. The widespread use of social media has amplified these trends, with viral risk-taking challenges and online peer influences contributing to negative outcomes. To better understand these dynamics, this proposal aims to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models that capture the neural and network mechanisms underlying social influence in adolescence.\n\nOur research questions focus on when and from whom adolescents seek social information, and how these factors impact behavior. To address these questions, we will develop novel tasks, employ computational models, and utilize functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) and social network analyses. Our approach recognizes adolescents as active information seekers, rather than passive recipients of social influence, and will involve an experimental study in real peer social networks.\n\nWe expect our research to provide valuable insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advance our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting prosocial behavior and reducing risk-taking. By integrating cutting-edge methods from neuroscience, computer science, and social network analysis, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of adolescent development and behavior, ultimately informing strategies to support healthy growth and positive outcomes."
