        "Here is a 307-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NeuMERGE)\n\nThe NeuMERGE project seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, a fundamental aspect of human experience. Despite its significance, the neural processes that distinguish consciously perceived stimuli from those that are not remain poorly understood. This proposal aims to investigate the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory, and to determine the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness.\n\nBuilding on our previous finding that weak simple stimuli can be reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, we will employ a multi-pronged approach to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions. This will involve measuring activity of single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using implanted electrodes, as well as recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey. We will also characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex, and use perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys to measure a 'functional connectome'.\n\nBy investigating brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience, we expect to provide insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception. Our research will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, shedding light on the complex interplay between attention, working memory, and conscious awareness. Ultimately, this knowledge may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for disorders of consciousness.",
        "Here is a 307-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NeuMERCE)\n\nThis proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, a fundamental aspect of human experience. Despite significant advances in neuroscience, the reasons why we consciously perceive certain visual stimuli and not others remain unclear. Our project, NeuMERCE, aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory.\n\nBuilding on our previous work demonstrating that weak simple stimuli can be reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, we will employ a multi-pronged approach to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions. We will measure activity of single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using implanted electrodes, record from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey, and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex.\n\nFurthermore, we will use perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys to measure a 'functional connectome' and investigate brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience. Our research will provide insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception, shedding light on the neural mechanisms that govern our subjective experience of the world. By elucidating the neural basis of conscious perception, NeuMERCE has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human cognition and behavior.",
        "Here is a 307-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NEUROMERCE)\n\nThe NEUROMERCE project seeks to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, a fundamental aspect of human experience. Despite significant advances in neuroscience, the reasons why some visual stimuli enter conscious awareness while others do not remain poorly understood. Our proposal aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the neural fate of simple and complex visual stimuli across multiple brain regions.\n\nBuilding on our previous finding that weak simple stimuli can be reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, we will employ a multi-pronged approach to explore the neural mechanisms of conscious perception. We will measure activity in single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using implanted electrodes, record from numerous single neurons in monkeys, and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. Additionally, we will use perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys to measure a 'functional connectome' and investigate brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience.\n\nOur research goals are to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions, elucidate the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory, and determine how the visual cortex functions as a relay station for simple stimuli. We expect our findings to provide unprecedented insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception, ultimately shedding light on the neural basis of conscious experience. The proposed project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches to disorders of consciousness."
