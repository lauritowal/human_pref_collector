        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThis project investigates the critical role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, with a focus on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The significance of this research lies in its potential to illuminate the impact of new media on citizen engagement and the counter-movement against the Mexican government. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, combining theoretical and comparative analyses, this study will provide a nuanced understanding of disappearance as a crime and its representation in digital memory.\n\nThe project will comparatively examine Mexico's case alongside social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, highlighting the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World. Through this research, we aim to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. This model will enable scholars and practitioners to better understand the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries transgressed in digital memory.\n\nThe proposed project's output will be a groundbreaking theoretical framework that sheds light on the complex interplay between digital media, memory, and social movements. By exploring the ways in which digital media shapes our understanding of disappearance, this research will contribute to a deeper comprehension of the power dynamics at play in the construction of transnational memories. Ultimately, this project seeks to inspire new forms of citizen engagement and advocacy, promoting accountability and justice for the victims of disappearance and their families.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThis project investigates the pivotal role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, with a focus on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The case study is significant because it highlights the impact of new media on citizen engagement and counter-movements against the Mexican government. By employing both theoretical and multidisciplinary approaches, this research will explore the concept of disappearance as a crime and its representation in digital memory, as well as the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World.\n\nA comparative analysis will be conducted to examine Mexico's case in relation to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina. The project's primary output will be a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. This model will provide a framework for understanding how digital media shapes our collective memory of disappearance and informs social movements across borders.\n\nUltimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries transgression in digital memory. By examining the intersections of digital media, memory, and social movements, this project will shed light on the complex dynamics of transnational activism and its potential to challenge state power and promote social change.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThis project investigates the pivotal role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, with a focus on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The case study provides a unique lens to examine how digital media influences citizen engagement and fuels counter-movements against government authorities. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, combining theoretical and empirical methods, this research will uncover the ways in which digital media reconfigures the boundaries of memory, identity, and social mobilization.\n\nThe project's significance lies in its ability to illuminate the impact of new media on civic participation and social change, particularly in the context of Mexico's struggles with forced disappearance. A comparative analysis with Spain and Argentina will provide a richer understanding of the transnational dimensions of disappearance and its representation in artistic and social performances.\n\nThe proposed research aims to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. This model will contribute to our understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries of digital memory. By exploring the intersection of digital media, memory, and social movements, this project will provide valuable insights into the ways in which technology is redefining our relationship with the past, present, and future. Ultimately, this research will inform strategies for promoting social justice, human rights, and democratic engagement in the digital age."
