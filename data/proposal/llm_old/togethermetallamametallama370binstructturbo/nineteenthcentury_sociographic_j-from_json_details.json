        "Here is a 258-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\n\nThis project undertakes a groundbreaking examination of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as a foundational precursor to modern social science. Through a comprehensive study of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, this research aims to elucidate the role of sociographic journalism in shaping ethnographic and sociological knowledge. By employing anthropological and historiographical approaches, this project will analyze the representational techniques of sociographic journalism, its connection to epistemic developments, and its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings. Furthermore, it will explore the relations between journalistic sketches and urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines. The project's outcomes will include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. By situating sociographic journalism within its historical and cultural context, this research will provide new insights into the formation of social science and its ongoing relevance to contemporary debates. Ultimately, this project will demonstrate the significance of sociographic journalism as a precursor to modern social science, shedding light on the complex relationships between representation, knowledge, and power in the nineteenth century.",
        "Here is a 258-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\n\nThis project undertakes a groundbreaking examination of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism, a neglected yet crucial precursor to modern social science. By analyzing a diverse corpus of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, this study will reveal the representational techniques, epistemic developments, and socio-spatial contexts that shaped the emergence of ethnographic and sociological knowledge. Employing anthropological and historiographical approaches, the project will investigate the connections between sociographic journalism and academic, artistic, and governmental projects, as well as its embeddedness in key processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and disciplinary institutionalization.\n\nThe project's outcomes will include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. By exploring the intersections of journalism, urbanization, and knowledge production, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the genesis of social science disciplines and their relationships to broader cultural and historical trends. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a richer comprehension of the complex dynamics underlying the development of modern social thought, with implications for contemporary debates on the role of journalism in shaping public discourse and understanding.",
