        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE (SLaVEgents)\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the role of enslaved persons in shaping ancient societies and cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By focusing on slave agency, SLaVEgents will explore the multiple identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals and their significant influence on historical changes. The project will cover a vast geographical scope, including Western Eurasia and North Africa, and will analyze texts in eight ancient languages: Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nA diverse research team, consisting of one Principal Investigator, eight senior researchers, seven postdoctoral researchers, and three PhD candidates, will collaborate to produce a range of research outputs. These will include a digital prosopography, one monograph, two collective volumes, 15 articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, and one international conference. A project website will also be created to disseminate findings and facilitate collaboration.\n\nBy shedding light on the often-overlooked experiences and contributions of enslaved persons, SLaVEgents will provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of ancient societies and cultures. This project has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of the ancient world and its legacies, and will contribute to a more inclusive and diverse representation of the past.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE (SLaVEgents)\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of ancient societies and cultures by placing enslaved persons at the forefront of historical inquiry. Focusing on the pivotal role of slave agency, SLaVEgents will investigate the complex identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals in Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. By examining the significant historical changes influenced by enslaved persons, this project will challenge dominant narratives and offer a more nuanced understanding of ancient societies.\n\nA team of 19 researchers, led by a principal investigator and comprising senior researchers, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD candidates, will collaborate to achieve this goal. The project's interdisciplinary approach will draw on expertise in Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin languages and literatures.\n\nThe project's outputs will include a digital prosopography, one monograph, two collective volumes, 15 articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, an international conference, and a dedicated website. By shedding light on the hitherto underappreciated contributions of enslaved persons to ancient societies and cultures, SLaVEgents will make a significant impact on the field of ancient history and beyond. This project has the potential to reshape our understanding of the ancient world and inform contemporary debates about identity, community, and social justice.",
        "Here is a 279-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE (SLaVEgents)\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of ancient societies and cultures by foregrounding the agency of enslaved persons in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By examining the multifaceted identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals, we will uncover their significant contributions to shaping historical outcomes. Our interdisciplinary team of 19 researchers, led by a principal investigator and 8 senior researchers, will employ a range of methodologies to analyze a diverse array of sources in 8 ancient languages.\n\nThe project's digital prosopography will provide a comprehensive database of enslaved persons, while a monograph, 2 collective volumes, and 15 articles will disseminate our findings to academic and broader audiences. Additionally, 3 PhD dissertations, 3 workshops, and an international conference will foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among scholars. A dedicated website will ensure public engagement and access to our research.\n\nBy shifting the focus from slave owners to enslaved individuals, SLaVEgents will challenge prevailing narratives and offer a more nuanced understanding of ancient societies and cultures. Our research will not only enrich the field of ancient history but also inform contemporary debates about social justice, inequality, and human rights. We believe that this innovative project has the potential to make a lasting impact on our understanding of the ancient world and its ongoing legacies."
