        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\nThis proposal seeks to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in post-industrial Europe, with a focus on the economic implications of local air quality changes and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The project's key objective is to address the pressing need for improved environmental quality, driven by global climate change and increasing demand for environmental quality. The main origins of regulated pollution, namely the combustion of fossil fuels, will be targeted through a novel interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models. This will enable the development of new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, and the incorporation of subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates. The project will consist of two parts: Part I will examine the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, while Part II will investigate the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. By providing empirical evidence in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management, this project has the potential to make a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus, ultimately informing policy-makers and contributing to improved environmental regulation in post-industrial Europe.",
        "Here is a 274-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\nThis project aims to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in post-industrial Europe, with a focus on the economic implications of local air quality changes and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The proposed research is critically important in the context of global climate change and increasing demand for environmental quality. The main origins of regulated pollution, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, will be examined using an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models. The project will develop new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail and incorporate subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates. The research will be divided into two parts, with Part I focusing on the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and Part II examining the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The project's key objective is to provide high-quality, policy-relevant research that can inform environmental policy-making in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management. The potential impact of this project is significant, with the potential to have a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus.",
