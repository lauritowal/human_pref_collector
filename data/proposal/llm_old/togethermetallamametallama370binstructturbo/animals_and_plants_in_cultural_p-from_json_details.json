        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\nThis project, \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" proposes to explore the dynamic role of non-human beings in shaping human cultural life in the Amazon River Basin. Through the lens of \"zoophytography,\" a concept that describes the inscription of animals and plants in texts, films, and artworks, we aim to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to these non-human entities. The project is divided into three research streams: Amazonian Zoophytography, which will formulate a definition of zoophytography and trace its roots to Indigenous, riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy; Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out, which will focus on the articulation of animals in cultural productions; and Flora's Voice: Phytographic Conversations, which will examine plant inscription in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nThis project contributes to the environmental humanities, Amazonian ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. The outcomes of this research will provide a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, reveal the interdependence of humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia, and uncover more equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants. By decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making, this project will offer a fresh perspective on the Amazon River Basin and its inhabitants, ultimately promoting a more inclusive and sustainable understanding of the region.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\nThis project proposes to investigate how cultural productions about the Amazon River Basin, including texts, cinema, and art, represent and give voice to non-human beings, such as animals and plants. The concept of zoophytography is central to this inquiry, as it highlights the dynamic role of non-humans in shaping human cultural life. The main challenge lies in assessing how these cultural productions lend a voice to animals and plants, often marginalized or overlooked in traditional narratives.\n\nThe project is divided into three research streams. The first stream, Amazonian Zoophytography, will formulate a definition of zoophytography and trace its roots to Indigenous, riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy. The second stream, Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out, will focus on the articulation of animals in cultural productions, while the third stream, Flora's Voice: Phytographic Conversations, will examine the inscription of plants in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nThis project will contribute to the fields of environmental humanities, Amazonian ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, a revelation of the interdependence of humans and non-humans, and a drawing of attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia. Ultimately, this project aims to uncover more equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants, decentring humanity as the sole source of meaning-making.",

The central hypothesis is that these cultural productions highlight the dynamic and shaping influence of non-human beings on human cultural life. Through the concept of \"zoophytography,\" this project will assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants, and what this means for our understanding of the interdependence of humans and non-humans.\n\nThe project is organized into three research streams.
