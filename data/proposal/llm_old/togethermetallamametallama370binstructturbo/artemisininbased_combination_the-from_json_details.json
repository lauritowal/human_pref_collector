        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project investigates the global pharmaceutical drug market using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) as a case study in two African countries (Benin and Ghana) with differing pharmaceutical systems, and conducts a comparison study in Cambodia. The project aims to understand the realities affecting the global drug market in terms of supply and demand, analyze globalizing processes affecting drugs, study public health consequences, compare drug systems, and address the issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nThe project consists of six work packages, including the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, analysis of drug use, scope of ACT consumption, local production and ACT regulations, and an opening into Asia. The project will be managed through WP6, which includes project management, results dissemination, organization of two symposiums, and institutional impacts.\n\nThe project's goals are to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project will involve training components, including 8 Master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doctoral researcher. The project is supported by the PI's skills in methodology and theory, as well as solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana. By combining anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the global pharmaceutical drug market and its implications for public health in Africa and Asia.",
        "Here is a 304-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the global pharmaceutical drug market using Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as a case study in two African countries, Benin and Ghana, with differing pharmaceutical systems. A comparative study in Cambodia will provide valuable insights into the globalizing processes affecting the drug market. Our objectives are to study the realities affecting the global drug market, analyze the impact of globalization on drugs in Benin and Ghana, examine public health consequences, and compare drug systems. We will also address the pressing issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nThe project is divided into six work packages, covering the formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, drug use, ACT consumption, local production, and regulations. A comparative study in Cambodia will provide a unique perspective on the global drug market. Our team, comprising experts from anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, will employ a mixed-methods approach to gather data.\n\nThe project aims to foster reflection on more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. We will achieve this through a robust training program, comprising 8 Master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doctoral researcher, who will benefit from the PI's expertise in methodology and theory. Our solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana will ensure access to valuable data and stakeholders. The project will culminate in two symposiums, ensuring the dissemination of results and institutional impacts. By understanding the complexities of the global pharmaceutical drug market, we can contribute to improving public health outcomes in Africa.",
