        "Here is a 220-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas\n\nThis project investigates the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas in Europe. As prejudice towards marginalized groups and support for far-right parties rise, it is crucial to understand why financial crises coincide with increased support for these ideologies. Our research aims to unravel how economic hardship affects support for socially conservative agendas and how policy contexts at local and national levels influence this relationship. We propose a multi-method empirical approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, to explore the role of narratives of loss in triggering support for socially conservative political agendas. The study will compare five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) with varying levels of economic hardship compensation. By examining the intersection of economic hardship, policy contexts, and narratives of loss, this project will provide invaluable insights into the complex dynamics driving support for socially conservative agendas, ultimately informing strategies to promote social cohesion and mitigate the rise of far-right ideologies.",
        "Here is a 220-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas\n\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas in Europe. Despite growing prejudice towards marginalized groups and the rise of far-right parties, the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain poorly understood. We aim to unravel how economic hardship affects support for socially conservative agendas and how policy contexts at local and national levels influence this relationship. Our theoretical framework draws on political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioural economics. We hypothesize that economic hardship translates into narratives of loss, which in turn trigger support for socially conservative political agendas. Using a multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research, we will compare five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) with varying levels of compensation for economic hardship. By examining the role of context in shaping narratives of loss and political support, this project will provide critical insights into the drivers of socially conservative attitudes and inform strategies to promote community cohesion and social inclusion.",

Our research aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating how economic hardship affects support for socially conservative agendas and how policy contexts at local and national levels influence this relationship. We propose a multi-method empirical approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, to explore the narratives of loss that emerge during times of economic hardship and how they translate into political support. Our study will compare five European countries (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) with varying levels of economic hardship compensation, providing a nuanced understanding of the role of context in shaping these narratives. By uncovering the origins of support for socially conservative agendas, this project will inform strategies to promote community cohesion and mitigate the risks associated with growing prejudice."
