        "Here is a 297-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\n\nThis project seeks to reevaluate the significance of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe during the Middle Ages (1100-1450). By examining the relationship between language and identity in this period, we aim to understand how French contributed to the emergence of a European identity. Our research will focus on the linguistic identity of Europe, exploring how French interacted with other languages, including Latin, to shape cultural and national identities.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, combining codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, we will conduct empirical research on the textual tradition of \"L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César\", a key work of medieval French literature. Our international team of scholars from Europe and North America will collaborate to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of French in medieval Europe.\n\nThe project's goals include fostering collaboration between different scholarly traditions, conducting empirical research, and engaging in speculative reflection on linguistic identity. Our final aim is to interrogate French language's role in the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages. By exploring the values of French language and literature in this period, we hope to shed new light on the complex dynamics of language, identity, and culture in medieval Europe. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical roots of European identity and its ongoing evolution.",
        "Title: The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to reevaluate the role of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe during the Middle Ages (1100-1450). By examining the relationship between language and identity, we aim to challenge prevailing narratives about the emergence of a European identity during this period. Our research will focus on the demarcation of cognate languages, including French, Latin, and other non-local languages, and their impact on linguistic identity in Europe.\n\nThrough a collaborative approach, bringing together scholars from European and North American countries, we will employ a range of methodologies, including codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology. Our empirical research will center on the textual tradition of \"L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César,\" a key work that exemplifies the transnational nature of French language and literature during the Middle Ages.\n\nOur project goals include facilitating collaboration between different scholarly traditions, conducting empirical research, and engaging in speculative reflection on linguistic identity. Ultimately, our research aims to interrogate the role of French language in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages, providing new insights into the complex dynamics of language, identity, and culture during this period.",

Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, we will investigate the relationship between language and identity in medieval Europe. Our research questions focus on the demarcation of cognate languages and the historical intersection of language and identity.\n\nThe Middle Ages were characterized by multilingualism, with Latin and French serving as non-local languages that transcended regional boundaries. Our project will examine the textual tradition of \"L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César\" as a case study, employing empirical research to shed new light on the use of French in this period.\n\nOur goals are threefold: to facilitate collaboration between scholars from European countries and North America, representing diverse scholarly traditions; to conduct empirical research on the textual tradition; and to engage in speculative reflection on linguistic identity. Ultimately, our project aims to interrogate the role of French in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages. By exploring the values of French language and literature in this period, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that have shaped European identity over time."
