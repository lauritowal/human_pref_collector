        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government (STATE-DNA)\n\nThis project, STATE-DNA, investigates the evolutionary dynamics of government structures and their impact on policy outcomes. Despite the significance of government structures in shaping policy, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of why they change and how these changes affect policy. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a novel, interdisciplinary approach that combines insights from evolutionary theory, organizational studies, and data assimilation techniques from biology.\n\nOur research questions focus on the drivers of structural change in government and its consequences for policy. We hypothesize that government structures change due to the interaction between unit-level structural features and the organizational and environmental context, and that these changes have an evolutionary impact on policy outcomes.\n\nUsing a unique dataset of over 150,000 units inside ministries and agencies across six countries from 1815 to 2025, we will develop genetic measures to assess structural change and apply data assimilation techniques to analyze the effects of these changes on policy. Our expected outcomes include a comprehensive dataset of government structures, a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on policy, and predictive forecasting of future structural changes.\n\nBy exploring the evolutionary dynamics of government structures, this project will provide new insights into the origins and consequences of structural change, ultimately informing strategies for more effective and adaptive governance.",
        "Here is a 281-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government\n\nThe STATE-DNA project seeks to investigate the dynamics of structural change in government, exploring why government structures evolve and how these changes impact policy outcomes. Building on the theory of evolutionary government, this study posits that government structures change due to the interaction between a unit's structural features and its organizational and environmental context. Furthermore, we hypothesize that structural change in government affects policy as an evolutionary consequence managed by distinct units.\n\nUsing a novel combination of genetic measures and data assimilation techniques from biology, this project will create a comprehensive dataset of government structures spanning from 1815 to 2025, covering 150,000 units across six countries. Our analysis will focus on the key concepts of structural change, units inside ministries and agencies, and the decline of party government.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy, a comprehensive dataset of government structures since the early 19th century, and predictive forecasting of future structural changes in government. By shedding light on the evolutionary dynamics of government, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between government structures, policy outcomes, and the broader political environment.",

Despite the significance of government structures in shaping policy, there is a lack of understanding of why these structures change and how such changes affect policy decisions. This project addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the interactions between a unit's structural features and its organizational and environmental context, and how these interactions lead to structural change. We hypothesize that structural change in government is an evolutionary consequence managed by distinct units, which in turn affects policy outcomes.\n\nUsing a novel approach that combines genetic measures and data assimilation techniques from biology, this study will analyze a comprehensive dataset of government structures from six countries over two centuries (1815-2025), comprising over 150,000 units. The project's expected outcomes include a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy, a comprehensive dataset of government structures since the early 19th century, and predictive forecasting of structural changes in government. By advancing our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of government structures, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and practitioners seeking to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of government institutions."
