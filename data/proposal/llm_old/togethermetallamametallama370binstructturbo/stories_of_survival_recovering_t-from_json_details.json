        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nThis transnational research project seeks to recover the connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world, spanning the 16th to 18th centuries. By examining the global migration of Eastern Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas, our team of multiple researchers, led by a Principal Investigator, will uncover the intricate networks and stories of survival that shaped the experiences of these communities. Our analytical framework is rooted in global and connected histories, and we will draw on dozens of archives across three continents, utilizing source materials in ten languages. Through a rigorous methodology combining philology and source criticism, we will link micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history, addressing a significant conceptual challenge in the field. The project's outcomes will include print publications, workshops, and a searchable database, providing a rich resource for scholars and the public alike. By exploring the lives and stories of Eastern Christians during this pivotal period, we will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of early modern global history.",
        "Here is a 303-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nThis project recovers the transnational histories of Eastern Christians who migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas from the 16th century onwards. By analyzing source materials from dozens of archives across three continents in 10 languages, our research team, led by a principal investigator, will reconstruct the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Our innovative approach links micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history, utilizing philology and source criticism to excavate the experiences of Eastern Christians. The project's outcomes will include print publications, workshops, and a searchable database, covering the period from 1500 to 1750. By exploring the Middle Eastern, European, and global histories of Eastern Christianity, this project addresses a significant conceptual challenge in the field, namely, the integration of local experiences into broader global narratives. The project's dissemination strategy ensures that our findings will be accessible to a wide audience, including scholars, students, and the general public. Ultimately, \"Stories of Survival\" will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of identity, culture, and religion that shaped the lives of Eastern Christians in the early modern world, offering a fresh perspective on the interconnected nature of global history.",
        "Here is a 303-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nThis transnational project seeks to recover the connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world, tracing the global migration of Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas from the 16th century onwards. By adopting a global and connected histories analytical frame, our team of multiple researchers, led by a Principal Investigator, will explore the everyday lives of Eastern Christians and link them to macro-narratives in global history. We will draw on dozens of archives across three continents, working with source materials in ten languages.\n\nThrough a rigorous methodological core of philology and source criticism, we will produce a range of outcomes, including print publications, workshops, and a searchable database. Our project will cover the period from 1500 to 1750 and will contribute to the fields of Middle Eastern history, European history, and global history.\n\nThe conceptual challenge at the heart of this project is to bridge the gap between micro-scale everyday life and macro-narratives in global history. By meeting this challenge, we will provide a nuanced understanding of the experiences of Eastern Christians and their role in shaping the early modern world. Our dissemination strategy will ensure that our findings reach a broad audience, from academic specialists to the general public. Ultimately, \"Stories of Survival\" will offer a new perspective on the early modern world, highlighting the agency and resilience of Eastern Christian communities in the face of migration, displacement, and cultural exchange."
