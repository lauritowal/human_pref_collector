        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC)\n\nThis project, POLEMIC, seeks to investigate the role of emotions in political decision-making and the strategic use of emotional appeals by politicians. Through a comprehensive and comparative analysis of political discourse and citizen responses across nine countries from 1945 to the present, we aim to answer three key research questions: Do emotional appeals affect citizens' political choices? Are politicians making more emotional appeals than in the past? And why are they doing so? By bridging the fields of party politics and political psychology, we will employ innovative methods, including automated text analysis and physiological measurement, to test three theories: vote-maximizing strategy, the product of politician's personality, and fashionable trend. Our study will provide new insights into the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. By shedding light on the complex interplay between politics and emotions, POLEMIC will extend existing theory and inform strategies for more effective and responsive political communication.",
        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC)\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the role of emotions in politics, examining how emotional appeals influence citizens' political choices and why politicians increasingly use emotional rhetoric. The POLEMIC project will bridge the fields of party politics and political psychology, integrating macro-level analysis of politician discourse with micro-level examination of citizen response. Using novel methods, including automated text analysis and physiological measurement, we will analyze political speech and citizen response across nine countries from 1945 to the present. Our research aims to answer three key questions: Do emotional appeals affect citizens' political choices? Have politicians increased their use of emotional appeals over time? And why are politicians making more emotional appeals? We will test three theories: the vote-maximizing strategy, the product of politician's personality, and the fashionable trend. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. By advancing our knowledge of emotional appeals in politics, POLEMIC will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between politics and emotions.",

Focusing on nine countries from 1945 to the present, we will address three key research questions: Do emotional appeals affect citizens' political choices? Do politicians make more emotional appeals than in the past? And why are they doing so? By bridging the fields of party politics and political psychology, we will test three theories: vote-maximizing strategy, product of politician's personality, and fashionable trend. Our innovative approach combines automated text analysis and physiological measurement to examine both macro-level (politicians' rhetoric) and micro-level (citizens' responses) perspectives. We expect to provide new insights into the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. Ultimately, POLEMIC will extend existing theory and inform strategies for more effective and persuasive political communication."
