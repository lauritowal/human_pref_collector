        "Here is a 290-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: The Design, Creation, and Survival of Democratic Laws (DEMOLAW)\n\nThe DEMOLAW project seeks to advance our understanding of the design, creation, and long-term survival of democratic legislation in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union. Through the application of cutting-edge computational methods, this project aims to analyze legislative texts and answer three fundamental research questions: What conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law? Why does the design of democratic legislation vary? And how can we explain the stability or change in laws over time? \n\nBy integrating novel conceptual perspectives on legislative design, an innovative theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival, and methodological advancements for computational analysis of legislative content, DEMOLAW will provide a comprehensive understanding of democratic lawmaking. The project's analytical framework will focus on two key dimensions: versatility and precision. \n\nThe expected outcomes of DEMOLAW include a deeper understanding of the design and creation of democratic laws, as well as the factors contributing to their survival or change over time. This knowledge will inform policymakers, scholars, and the broader public about the intricacies of democratic lawmaking, ultimately contributing to more effective and resilient democratic institutions.",

The project's analytical framework will focus on two key dimensions: versatility and precision. By exploring these dimensions, DEMOLAW will shed light on the intricate relationships between legislative design, political context, and long-term survival. Ultimately, this project will provide a deeper understanding of the democratic legislative process, informing policymakers and scholars alike.",
        "Title: The Design, Creation, and Survival of Democratic Laws (DEMOLAW)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe DEMOLAW project aims to investigate the design, creation, and long-term survival of democratic legislation in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union. By leveraging cutting-edge computational methods, this project seeks to answer three major research questions: Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law? Why does the design of democratic legislation vary? How can we explain the stability or change in laws over time?\n\nThis project will make three significant contributions to the field of political science: a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design, an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival, and methodological advancements for computational analysis of legislative content. The project will analyze legislative texts in the three selected political systems, examining two key analytical dimensions: versatility and precision.\n\nBy shedding light on the design, creation, and survival of democratic laws, DEMOLAW will provide new insights into the functioning of democratic systems and inform strategies for effective lawmaking. The project's findings will be relevant to policymakers, legal scholars, and political scientists, ultimately enhancing our understanding of democratic governance and the role of legislation in shaping society."
