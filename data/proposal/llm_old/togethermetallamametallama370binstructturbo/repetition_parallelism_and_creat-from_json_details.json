        "Here is a 273-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Repetition, Parallelism, and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\n\nThis project, REPAC, seeks to illuminate the intricate relationships between textual form and function in Ancient Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions. Focusing on the first millennium BCE, we will investigate how scribes employed repetition, parallelism, and other structural devices on clay tablets in Cuneiform script and Akkadian language. Our analysis will delve into literary, magical, and mantic genres, examining features such as exact repetition, variant repetition, refrain, ring composition, and their functions in facilitating poetic creativity, rhetorical effectiveness, and argumentation inventiveness. We will also explore how these textual features served aesthetic, analogical, argumentative, and magical purposes, shedding light on the scribes' worldview and their beliefs in interconnection, causal effectiveness, and similarity.\n\nA significant knowledge gap exists in understanding the Mesopotamian literary and scholarly method, particularly regarding the role of worldview and analogy. By addressing this gap, REPAC aims to provide an improved understanding of Ancient Mesopotamian creative effort and its significance in the development of literary and intellectual traditions. Our expected outcome is a nuanced understanding of how Mesopotamian scribes constructed meaning through textual form and function, thereby enriching our appreciation of this ancient civilization's rich cultural heritage.",
