        "Here is a potential abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nThis project, Resilient Cultures, explores the ways in which popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema in mainland China and Hong Kong express social and political discontent, and develop resilient tactics to critique authoritarianism in the face of platformization. Through a comparative analysis of indie and folk music scenes, art institutes, and socially engaged art projects in five localities (Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui), we will examine how cultural producers navigate the complexities of creative expression under authoritarian regimes. Our methodological toolkit includes ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research with local artists and activists. The project aims to establish a vibrant network of scholars, artists, and cultural institutions across East Asia, Europe, and beyond, with activities including workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions. By examining the diversity and vitality of cultural production in these contexts, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of culture in promoting social change and democracy. The project will also engage in comparative analysis with similar contexts in Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, further illuminating the global implications of our research. Ultimately, Resilient Cultures seeks to amplify the voices and practices of cultural producers who are pushing the boundaries of creative expression and social critique.",
        "Here is a 289-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, Resilient Cultures, examines how popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema in mainland China and Hong Kong respond to and resist authoritarianism, leveraging platformization to express social and political discontent. Through a comparative analysis of indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, we will investigate the ways in which cultural practitioners develop resilient tactics to critique and subvert dominant narratives. Our methodological toolkit combines ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research to capture the complexity and diversity of cultural production in these regions.\n\nThe project aims to establish a network of scholars, artists, and activists across mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, fostering exchange and collaboration through workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions. By bridging cultural fields and localities, we expect to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the vitality and diversity of cultural production in these regions, highlighting the multivocality of cultural practices that resist and negotiate authoritarianism. Our comparative contexts in Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey will further illuminate the global implications of our research. Ultimately, Resilient Cultures seeks to rescue and amplify the voices of cultural practitioners who, despite adversity, continue to create and inspire, promoting a deeper understanding of the role of culture in shaping social change.",

Focusing on popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, our research aims to understand how these cultural fields navigate authoritarianism and platformization to critique and challenge prevailing power structures. Through a comparative analysis of indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, we will explore how cultural producers employ creative strategies to circumvent censorship and promote diversity and multivocality. Our methodological toolkit includes ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research. The project's network goals involve fostering regional and international connections through workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe. By examining the vitality of cultural production in these contexts, we will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between culture, power, and resistance. The project's findings will be contextualized within a broader comparative framework, drawing on examples from Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey."
