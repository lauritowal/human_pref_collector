        "Title: Control of Impulsive Action\n\nThis proposal seeks to advance our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and improve them, with significant benefits for individuals and society. Our research aims to address six key questions: the origins of novel impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functionality of impulsive actions, and the relationships between state and trait impulsivity. To achieve this, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making. Our objectives are to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions, replace dominant inhibitory control models with multifaceted alternatives, explain impulsivity across time and space, develop a new behavioral model, and understand individual differences and disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. By elucidating the complexities of impulsive action, this project will provide critical insights for the development of novel interventions and treatments for impulse-control disorders.",

This project aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and how to improve them. We will investigate five key research questions: the origins of novel impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functionality of impulsive actions, and the relationship between state and trait impulsivity.\n\nTo address these questions, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS and EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making. Our objectives are to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions, develop detailed multifaceted models of impulsivity, explain impulsivity and control across time and space, create a new behavioral model of impulsive action, and understand individual differences in impulsivity and disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.\n\nBy achieving these objectives, this project will provide a fundamental understanding of impulse control, enabling the development of novel interventions and treatments for disorders characterized by impulse-control deficits, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders. Ultimately, this project has the potential to improve the lives of individuals and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.",
        "Here is a 263-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Control of Impulsive Action\n\nImpulsive actions can have severe consequences for individuals and society, yet the underlying mechanisms of impulse control remain poorly understood. This project aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and develop strategies to improve them. To achieve this, we will investigate five key research questions: the emergence of novel impulsive actions during task preparation, the role of negative emotions in impulsive action, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functional and dysfunctional consequences of impulsive actions, and the relationship between state and trait impulsivity. \n\nWe will employ a multi-method approach, combining behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS and EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making. The objectives of this project are to specify the origin and control of impulsive actions, replace dominant 'inhibitory control' models with detailed multifaceted models, explain impulsivity and control across time and space, develop a new behavioral model of impulsive action, and understand the causes of individual differences in impulsivity and disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. By elucidating the complex mechanisms underlying impulsive action, this project has the potential to inform the development of novel interventions and treatments for impulsivity-related disorders, ultimately improving the well-being of individuals and society."
