        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth, and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\nThis project challenges conventional narratives of eighteenth-century political economy by shifting the focus from abstract theories to practical concerns and policies aimed at betterment and improvement. Through a comprehensive study of the Swedish Empire, we will reexamine the historical development of political economy, moving beyond modernizing interpretations that impose contemporary methods and models on past debates. By exploring the intersections of growth, wealth, and welfare, we will uncover the ways in which various sites of discursive production – including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals – contributed to the evolution of political economy.\n\nOur hypothesis is that activities in each of these sites were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. By comparing the Swedish Empire to other cases, we will identify broader patterns and applicability, ultimately providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of early modern political economy. This project will not only revise our understanding of the eighteenth century but also inform contemporary debates on economic development, sustainability, and social welfare. By de-centering dominant narratives and highlighting the practical concerns of historical actors, we will create a more inclusive and historically grounded framework for understanding the evolution of political economy.",
        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\nThis project seeks to reassess the early history of European political economy by shifting the focus from abstract models to practical concerns and policies aimed at betterment and improvement. Through an in-depth examination of the Swedish Empire in the eighteenth century, we will challenge dominant narratives that have come to define the field. By exploring the key concepts of improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare, we will demonstrate how these ideas were shaped and contested across various discursive production sites, including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. Our hypothesis is that activities in each of these sites were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. Through a comparative approach that incorporates additional case studies, we will identify broader patterns and applicability, ultimately providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of eighteenth-century political economy. By de-centering the traditional focus on modern economic theories, this project will offer a new perspective on the historical development of political economy, highlighting the practical concerns and policies that shaped the pursuit of growth, wealth, and welfare in the eighteenth century.",
        "Here is a 291-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth, and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\nThis project challenges conventional approaches to the history of European political economy by shifting the focus from abstract theories to practical concerns of improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare in the eighteenth century. Through a detailed examination of the Swedish Empire, this study will explore how policymakers, scholars, and administrators sought to better the organization of state and society, as well as the living conditions of the people. By analyzing discursive production sites, including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, this project will uncover the diverse ways in which ideas about improvement were developed, debated, and implemented.\n\nUnlike previous studies that have imposed modern economic models on the past, this project will allow the historical actors to speak in their own voices, revealing the complexities and nuances of their economic thought. By comparing the Swedish case to other historical examples, this research will demonstrate the broad applicability of its findings, shedding new light on the evolution of political economy as a discipline. The project's hypothesis is that activities in each discursive production site were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. By de-centering the dominant narratives of economic thought, this project will provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the history of political economy, with significant implications for contemporary debates about economic development and social welfare."
