        "Here is a 283-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\n\nSocial scientists seek to understand the complex relationships between constructs such as values, beliefs, and risk perceptions to address pressing societal threats like climate change, political polarization, and vaccination hesitancy. However, current methods are limited by three key challenges: constructs are not directly observable, leading to measurement error; differing processes operate across diverse groups, making it hard to identify similar or different effects; and measurement inequivalence or non-invariance invalidates comparisons among constructs. These challenges can result in underestimated effects, misguided conclusions, and ineffective interventions.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework that integrates clustering and flexible measurement models. This approach will enable researchers to identify subsets of groups with common underlying processes and account for non-invariance across groups. By applying this framework to large-scale survey data, we will uncover the complex relationships between constructs and their role in shaping societal threats.\n\nOur proposed solution will be implemented in freely available software, making it accessible to a broad range of researchers. This project has the potential to revolutionize the field of social science by providing a more nuanced understanding of the processes underlying societal threats and informing effective interventions to address them. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the development of evidence-based policies and programs that mitigate the impact of climate change, political polarization, and vaccination hesitancy on individuals and communities.",
        "Here is a 283-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\n\nSocial scientists seek to understand the complex relationships between constructs such as values, beliefs, and perceived threats to address pressing societal issues like climate change, politics, and vaccination. However, current methods are hindered by three key challenges: constructs are not directly observable, leading to measurement error; differing processes operate across many groups, making it difficult to identify similar or different regression effects; and measurement inequivalence or non-invariance invalidates comparisons among constructs. These limitations can result in underestimated effects and misguided conclusions.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework that incorporates clustering to identify subsets of groups with common processes. This approach will enable the detection of distinct patterns of relationships between constructs, while accounting for measurement non-invariance. Our proposed solution will be implemented in freely available software, facilitating widespread adoption and collaboration.\n\nUsing large-scale survey data, our project will apply this innovative framework to investigate the relationships between constructs such as climate change beliefs, political beliefs, risk perception, and susceptibility to misinformation. By uncovering the underlying processes that drive these relationships, we will provide critical insights into the societal threats of climate change, political polarization, and vaccine hesitancy. Ultimately, this project will advance our understanding of the complex dynamics underlying these threats, informing evidence-based strategies to mitigate their impacts.",
