        "Here is a possible abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Metacognition of Concepts (MetCogCon)\n\nThe MetCogCon project seeks to investigate the thoughts and feelings that accompany the use of concepts, a crucial aspect of human cognitive capabilities. Concepts, such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, are tools for thought that vary in dependability and suitability, and our metacognitive awareness of these variations influences how we rely on, reject, or embrace them. Despite its importance, the metacognition of concepts remains poorly understood, lacking a clear theoretical framework.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, MetCogCon will combine analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science with psychological model-building and experimental investigation. By doing so, we aim to enhance our understanding of how metacognition affects concept selection, reasoning, and induction, as well as cognitive processes competing for action control.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are far-reaching, with implications for improving our understanding of cognitive control, addressing philosophical problems, and informing reasoning policies in everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts. Furthermore, MetCogCon's findings will determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the human mind. By exploring the metacognition of concepts, we can develop a more nuanced appreciation of how we think and make decisions, with significant implications for human cognition and decision-making.",

Concepts, such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, are essential tools for thought, but they vary in dependability and suitability. Despite their importance, the metacognition of concepts remains poorly understood, lacking a clear theoretical framework. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by exploring how metacognition influences our decision to rely on, reject, or embrace concepts, and how it affects the selection of concepts for reasoning and induction.\n\nThe MetCogCon project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, psychological model-building, and experimental investigation. By advancing our understanding of metacognition's role in concept selection and cognitive control, this project has the potential to improve reasoning policies in everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection. Furthermore, it will address fundamental philosophical problems and enhance our understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a comprehensive theoretical framework for metacognition of concepts, as well as empirical findings that shed light on the cognitive processes underlying concept use. Ultimately, the MetCogCon project will contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition, informing strategies for improving reasoning and decision-making in various contexts.",

Concepts are essential tools for human cognition, varying in dependability and suitability. However, the metacognitive processes underlying their selection and application are poorly understood, lacking a clear theoretical framework. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, employing psychological model-building, and conducting experimental investigations.\n\nThe project's objective is to elucidate how metacognition influences our decision to rely on, reject, or embrace concepts, affects the selection of concepts for reasoning and induction, and impacts cognitive processes competing for action control. The proposed research has significant potential impacts, including improving our understanding of cognitive control, addressing long-standing philosophical problems, and informing reasoning policies in everyday and scientific contexts. Furthermore, it will determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection, ultimately enhancing our understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind.\n\nBy exploring the metacognitive processes underlying concept use, MetCogCon will provide valuable insights into the workings of the human mind, with far-reaching implications for fields such as philosophy, cognitive science, and education. The expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive understanding of the metacognitive processes governing concept use, ultimately contributing to improved decision-making and problem-solving capabilities."
