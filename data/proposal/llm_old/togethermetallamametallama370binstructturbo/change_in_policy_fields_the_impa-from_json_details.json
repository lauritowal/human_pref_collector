        "Here is a 260-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010\n\nThis project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of morality policies across 25 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010. The objectives of this study are two-fold: first, to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies, and second, to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields. The project focuses on changes in morality policy over time, comparing across countries and policy subfields, including life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances and behavior. Using a mixed-methods approach, combining macro-quantitative analysis with qualitative case studies, this study will analyze legislative output data to identify critical cases. The case selection will be based on the results of the quantitative study, ensuring a nuanced understanding of the complex factors driving policy changes. By examining the interplay between international and domestic factors, this project aims to contribute to the theoretical understanding of policy change and provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and civil society organizations. The expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the dynamics of morality policy development, the identification of patterns and trends across countries and policy subfields, and the development of a framework for analyzing policy change in the context of morality policies.",
        "Here is a 260-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010\n\nThis project aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies in 25 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010. By comparing changes in morality policy over time and across countries, we seek to identify patterns and explanations for policy shifts in three subfields: life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances and behavior. Our mixed-method approach combines macro-quantitative analysis of legislative output data with qualitative case studies of critical cases selected based on the quantitative findings. This design enables us to capture both broad trends and nuanced, context-specific dynamics driving policy change.\n\nThe project addresses a significant gap in our understanding of morality policy development, which has important implications for social cohesion, human rights, and democratic governance. By examining the interplay between international and domestic factors shaping policy change, we will provide insights into the complex processes influencing morality policy outcomes. Our findings will inform policy debates, contribute to theoretical advancements in the field of comparative policy studies, and offer practical guidance for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to promote evidence-informed decision-making. Ultimately, this project will enhance our understanding of how morality policies evolve over time and how they can be designed to promote the well-being of individuals and societies.",
        "Here is a 260-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010\n\nThis project seeks to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies across 25 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010. The study aims to explain and identify patterns of changes in policy fields, with a focus on change over time, comparison across countries, and comparison across policy subfields. The project will examine three morality policy subfields: life and death (abortion, euthanasia), sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality), and addictive substances and behavior.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, the study will employ macro-quantitative analysis of legislative output data to identify trends and patterns of policy change. Qualitative case studies will then be conducted on critical cases selected based on the results of the quantitative study. This innovative approach will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors driving morality policy change, including international and domestic influences.\n\nThe project's findings will contribute to the development of a more nuanced theory of morality policy change and provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and stakeholders seeking to understand and navigate the complexities of morality policy development. By examining morality policy change across 25 OECD countries, this project will offer a unique comparative perspective on a critical area of policy study."
