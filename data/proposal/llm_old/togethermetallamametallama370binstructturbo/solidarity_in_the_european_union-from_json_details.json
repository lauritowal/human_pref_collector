        "Here is an abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Solidarity in the European Union\n\nThis project aims to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity in the context of the European Union (EUSOL1). The model will then be applied to four central issues in the EU: the free movement of persons, burden-sharing in the EU's refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). By providing a normative account of solidarity in the EU, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the principles and values that should guide EU policy and decision-making. The project's findings will inform strategies for promoting greater solidarity and cooperation among EU member states, ultimately strengthening the union and promoting the well-being of its citizens.",
        "Here is a 165-word abstract for the grant proposal:\n\nTitle: Solidarity in the European Union\n\nThis project aims to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity in the context of the European Union (EUSOL1) and apply it to central issues in the EU (EUSOL2). The proposed model will provide a comprehensive account of solidarity, addressing the complexities of free movement of persons, burden-sharing in the EU's refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession. By exploring the normative foundations of solidarity, this project will shed light on the principles and values that should guide EU policies and decision-making processes. The project's outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of the EU's solidarity framework, informing policy debates and fostering more effective and equitable solutions to the challenges facing the EU. Ultimately, this project will provide a nuanced and evidence-based perspective on solidarity in the EU, promoting a more just and cohesive European community.",
