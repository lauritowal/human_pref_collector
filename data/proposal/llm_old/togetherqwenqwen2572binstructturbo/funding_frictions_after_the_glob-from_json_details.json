        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis\" seeks to investigate the profound changes in financing conditions for countries, banks, pension funds, and life insurance companies in the aftermath of significant financial events, notably the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) and the market turmoil of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Central to this investigation are the manifestations of funding frictions, including elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and limited access to credit markets. The research aims to understand how these frictions impact default risk and to provide actionable insights for policy makers to optimize policy responses and reduce funding risks for financial institutions.\n\nKey research priorities include an in-depth analysis of market developments since the GFC, such as ballooning fiscal deficits in developed economies, tighter regulations on Money Market Mutual Funds, pension risk transfers to life insurance companies, and the implementation of Basel III. These changes have reshaped the landscape of financial regulation and market dynamics, necessitating a thorough examination of their effects on funding costs and credit market access.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include valuable insights into effective debt management strategies for sovereigns, enhanced awareness among policy makers regarding the unintended consequences of regulatory measures, and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that can mitigate funding frictions for various financial entities. This research is crucial for guiding future policy decisions and ensuring the stability and resilience of the global financial system."
