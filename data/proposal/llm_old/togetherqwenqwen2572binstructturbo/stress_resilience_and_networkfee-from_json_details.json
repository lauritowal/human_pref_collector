        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\" project aims to advance our understanding of how acute stress impacts large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition. We hypothesize that acute stress triggers dynamic shifts in resource allocation across these networks. Our objectives include characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of these shifts during stress and recovery, identifying neural markers of stress resilience using wearable biosensors and mobile applications, and validating these markers in a patient group with high stress sensitivity. Additionally, we will explore the roles of the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in mediating rapid network shifts and assess how alterations in network balance can disrupt cognitive functions. A key component of this project is the development of functional MRI (fMRI) neurofeedback techniques to train individuals in adaptive reallocation of neural resources, thereby enhancing stress resilience. This research will provide critical insights into brain adaptation to acute stress, contribute to the identification of transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience versus sensitivity, and pave the way for novel interventions to improve mental health."
