        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Plasticity of Parental Caregiving\" project aims to explore the brain mechanisms that underpin the development of parental caregiving in new parents, both in its normal progression and in disrupted scenarios. This comprehensive study is divided into three interconnected subprojects. Subproject 1 employs a longitudinal design to examine the normal development of parental caregiving, tracking both women and men from before pregnancy through early parenthood. Utilizing a combination of structural and functional neuroimaging and behavioral measures, this subproject seeks to map the brain changes and caregiving tasks that evolve over time. Subproject 2 adopts a cross-sectional approach to investigate disruptions in parental caregiving, focusing on conditions such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities like cleft lip and palate. This subproject will assess the impact of these disruptions on brain and behavioral outcomes, providing insights into how these challenges alter caregiving. Finally, Subproject 3 integrates the findings from the first two subprojects using advanced computational models to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks that govern the development of parenting. Together, these subprojects will provide a robust understanding of the neural and psychological dynamics of parental caregiving, with potential implications for interventions and support systems for new parents."
