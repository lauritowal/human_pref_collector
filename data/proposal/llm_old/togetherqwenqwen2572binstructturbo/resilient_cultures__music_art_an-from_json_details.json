        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\" project aims to explore the ways in which cultural practices in popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema develop resilient tactics to express social and political discontent. Focusing on mainland China and Hong Kong, this research will delve into the dynamics of resilience and cultural critique within the context of increasing authoritarianism and platformization. Through a comparative analysis of cultural fields such as indie and folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals, the project will examine how these forms of expression manifest in localities like Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui. Employing a robust methodological toolkit that includes ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research, the project seeks to build a network across mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe. Activities will include workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition, aiming to foster multivocality, diversity, and the vitality of cultural production. This research will also place the findings in a broader global context by comparing them with similar cultural dynamics in Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey."
