        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"In praise of community: shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979)\" aims to explore the performing arts as a product of commonality practices during the 1960s and 1970s in Italy. This interdisciplinary study will systematically analyze artist collaborations, applying the concept of the 'will-to-the-common' to the counterculture art of the period. By integrating historical, philosophical, and sociological perspectives, the project seeks to highlight the significance of artistic communities both locally and internationally. A key objective is to create a digital archive that will serve as a comprehensive resource for the collection, digitalization, restoration, and dissemination of Italian performing arts heritage. Utilizing innovative methodologies in performing arts knowledge and interpretation, as well as advanced digital archive visualization techniques, this project will provide a new model for understanding and preserving the cultural legacy of this dynamic era. The outcomes will not only enhance academic research but also contribute to broader public engagement and appreciation of the rich tapestry of Italian artistic and social history."
