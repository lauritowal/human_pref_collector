        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Social Politics in European Borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s\" aims to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by focusing on the roles of local actors and the complex interactions between public and private spheres. This study will concentrate on three key border regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border areas, during the period from the 1870s to the 1990s. By employing a comparative and transnational approach, the research seeks to uncover how local welfare structures were co-constructed and how they influenced the formation of national and non-national identities and solidarities. Anticipated outcomes include a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, the dynamics of competition among social providers, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. This historical analysis will not only enrich our understanding of the past but also inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address ongoing issues of social rights in Europe."
