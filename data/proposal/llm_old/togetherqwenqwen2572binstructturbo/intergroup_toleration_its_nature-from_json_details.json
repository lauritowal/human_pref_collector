        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project, \"Intergroup Toleration: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies,\" seeks to advance the field of social sciences by delving into the social psychology of intergroup toleration. As societies become increasingly diverse, the question of how to live harmoniously with those who are different becomes more pressing. This research aims to explore the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the psychological processes that foster it, the limits of toleration, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. Utilizing a multi-method approach, including survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, the project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of intergroup toleration. The novelty of this research lies in its systematic empirical investigation of a topic that, despite its importance, has received limited scholarly attention. By contributing to the theoretical and practical knowledge on intergroup relations, this project aims to foster a more inclusive and tolerant society, ultimately enhancing social cohesion and reducing conflict in diverse communities."
