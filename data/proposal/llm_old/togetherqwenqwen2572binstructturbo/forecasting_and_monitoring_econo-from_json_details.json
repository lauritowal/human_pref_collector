        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis Proof of Concept (PoC) grant proposal, titled \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators,\" seeks funding from the European Research Council (ERC) to advance the outcomes of the previous ERC-2007-StG grant, \"Change-Point Tests.\" The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive software toolbox that significantly enhances the forecasting and monitoring of economic indicators. This project introduces a novel family of models that leverage high-frequency data and real-time forecast monitoring, complemented by predictive breakdown tests to ensure the reliability of predictions. Key improvements over existing software include real-time monitoring capabilities and advanced predictive breakdown tests, designed to provide deeper insights into economic trends and potential anomalies.\n\nTargeted at governments, central banks, and firms, the software will be user-friendly, featuring three-dimensional graphical representations and direct accessibility to decision-makers. Initial collaborations with a forecasting agency and a central bank have been established to ensure the practical applicability and robustness of the tools developed. The ultimate goal is to improve economic forecasts and decision-making processes, contributing to more prudent economic policies, sustainable economic growth, and enhanced economic and social welfare."
