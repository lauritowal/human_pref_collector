        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\" aims to advance our understanding of Neolithic archaeological contexts, focusing on the earliest evidence of sheep and goat management. Through biogeochemical analyses of fossil teeth, this research will explore mechanisms such as the control of animals' reproductive cycles, changes in feeding habits, and interruptions to migratory-seasonal movements. The study will target key regions including the Southern and Northern Levant, and the Eastern Fertile Crescent. By analyzing faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers, the project seeks to unravel paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identify the ways in which human societies altered these animals, and discover early caprine management practices. Ultimately, the goal is to establish the temporal and spatial origins of animal domestication processes, contributing significantly to our knowledge of human-animal co-evolution during the Neolithic period."
