        "The project \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time\" seeks to explore the dynamics of authority delegation to international organizations (IOs) from 1986 to 2010. This research will investigate how and why states delegate different levels of authority to IOs, focusing on entities like the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO. The study adopts a comparative and longitudinal perspective, analyzing the steady extension of powers in the EU and IMF against the relatively constant authority in the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO. By integrating temporal dynamics, cohesion among principal states, and institutional design, the project aims to build a comprehensive theoretical model that enhances our understanding of the consequences of power delegation. Utilizing qualitative methods, including archival research and elite interviews with national and international officials, the research seeks to test hypotheses and contribute to the advancement of theoretical and empirical International Relations. This interdisciplinary approach, drawing from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, promises to provide valuable insights into the evolution of international governance and institutional empowerment."
