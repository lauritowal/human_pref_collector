        "**Abstract**\n\nThe \"Long-Term Investment\" project aims to explore the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through a comprehensive study divided into three interlinked components: Financial Markets, Incentives, and Effects of Investment. This study contrasts the capital-intensive, cost-efficiency-focused firms of the 20th century with 21st-century entities that compete on product quality and rely heavily on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. The first component will analyze how financial markets, traditionally viewed as discouraging long-term investment due to a focus on short-term shareholder gains, actually incorporate information about future investment opportunities into stock prices, assessing the efficiency of these information channels. The second component will delve into the role of incentives, examining how the horizon of incentives—whether short or long-term—affects managerial decisions, including the optimal design of incentive structures to foster long-term thinking, not just in corporate settings but also in educational contexts. Finally, the third component will tackle the challenge of demonstrating the benefits of long-term investments, particularly in areas like corporate social responsibility, and will seek to establish a clear link between such investments and firm value. This research will provide critical insights into the mechanisms that can support sustainable long-term investment, contributing to both academic knowledge and practical applications in business and policy-making."
