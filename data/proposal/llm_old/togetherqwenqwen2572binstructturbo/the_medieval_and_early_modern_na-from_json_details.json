        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use,\" aims to explore the least studied and understood aspects of maritime expansion during the medieval and early modern periods. Positioned within the History of Cartography, the project addresses a significant gap in current research, where a detailed technical study remains in its infancy. The research will tackle fundamental questions regarding the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, their technical evolution over time, and their practical use at sea. Employing an interdisciplinary approach, the methodology will integrate analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and the examination of manuscripts under special lighting conditions to unveil hidden graphic content, characterize the main geometric features of the charts, and establish connections with contemporary navigational methods. Building on previous work that solved the historical enigma of the Mercator projection's construction, this proposed research will address a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. The expected outcomes will contribute significantly to the History of Cartography and intellectual history at large, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nautical charts that played a crucial role in shaping global exploration and maritime trade."
