        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project, titled \"The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital,\" aims to investigate the long-term impacts of public policies and income changes on child health and human capital development in Spain. Grounded in the fetal origins hypothesis, this research focuses on the \"missing middle\" periodâ€”early childhood to adolescence (ages 0-15). Utilizing a comprehensive, large-scale dataset spanning 35 years, the study employs advanced econometric techniques to analyze the effects of specific interventions and shocks, including household material resources, parental time, medical treatments during birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand fluctuations. Key outcome measures include hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. The research also explores potential channels through which these factors influence child development, such as family size, parental time use, labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. By providing robust evidence on the causal mechanisms linking public policies and income to child health and human capital, this study aims to inform policy-making and improve outcomes for children in Spain."
