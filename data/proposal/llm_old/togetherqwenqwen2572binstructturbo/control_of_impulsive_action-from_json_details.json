        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"Control of Impulsive Action\" aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying impulse control, a critical cognitive function with profound implications for individual well-being and societal health. This project will address fundamental questions regarding the emergence and regulation of impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions in impulsivity, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functional and dysfunctional aspects of impulsivity, and the relationship between state and trait impulsivity. Utilizing an integrative approach that combines behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), physiological measures including facial Electromyography (EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, the project seeks to redefine the current models of impulsive action. Key objectives include the development of multifaceted models of impulsivity, the creation of a new behavioral model, and the elucidation of individual differences and associated disorders. This research promises to contribute significantly to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of impulsivity-related disorders."
