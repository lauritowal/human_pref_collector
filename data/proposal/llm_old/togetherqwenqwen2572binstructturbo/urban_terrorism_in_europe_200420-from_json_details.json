        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence\" (UrbTerr) project aims to conduct a comprehensive, comparative analysis of the memory discourses and societal responses to urban terrorism in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany between 2004 and 2019. During this period, more than ten terrorist attacks resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries, profoundly impacting these nations. UrbTerr will employ interdisciplinary approaches, integrating memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology to explore collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining in the aftermath of these attacks. A key objective is to develop a new materialist approach to terrorism, alongside assessing the effectiveness of policies and security infrastructures. The project will also innovate in memory practices through the use of performance art, aiming to create alternative forms of remembering and envisioning future scenarios. Expected outputs include a website featuring interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and public performances by the ‘Center for Political Beauty’. This project will provide critical insights into the social and cultural dimensions of terrorism and its legacies, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how societies cope with and respond to violent extremism."
