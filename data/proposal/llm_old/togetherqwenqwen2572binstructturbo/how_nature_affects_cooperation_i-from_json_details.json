        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"How nature affects cooperation in common pool resource systems\" aims to explore the intricate relationship between natural systems and the economic behaviors of individuals within common-pool resource (CPR) environments. This interdisciplinary project, spanning economics and sustainability science, seeks to establish how natural conditions shape the preferences and incentives of economic agents, thereby influencing CPR management. Our research will focus on three key mechanisms: the role of tipping points and thresholds in encouraging cooperative behaviors, the impact of resource abundance volatility on risk preferences and community-based management, and the interaction between leadership and environmental conditions in fostering cooperation. Utilizing both theoretical and statistical approaches, the project will cover case studies from three continents to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which natural and social factors align to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources. The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute significantly to the development of policies and practices that enhance the sustainability of CPR systems globally."
