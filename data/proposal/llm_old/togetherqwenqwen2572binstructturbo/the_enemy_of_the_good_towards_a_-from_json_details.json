        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, titled \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" aims to develop an innovative theory of moral progress that diverges from the prevailing \"expanding circle\" account. By focusing on various forms of moral progress, this research identifies and addresses the limitations of current moral frameworks, such as parochial empathy and altruism predominantly directed towards friends and kin. The project seeks to explore and enhance moral attitudes not constrained by evolutionary biases, promoting a more inclusive ethical landscape. It will also investigate the role of smart institutions in facilitating moral progress by bypassing the inherent limits of human psychology. The ultimate goal is to extend moral concern beyond ethically arbitrary features like class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership, fostering a more equitable and just society."
