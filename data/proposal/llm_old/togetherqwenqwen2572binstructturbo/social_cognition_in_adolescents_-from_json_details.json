        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\" aims to explore the intricate relationship between social brain functions and social network dynamics during adolescence. By integrating social network research with social brain research, this study will examine how the social-cognitive functions of adolescents are influenced by their position and structure within social networks. The target population consists of 1,000 adolescents across 50 classes, with a longitudinal design featuring six measurements over three years. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo annual fMRI scans to observe brain changes. Experimental tasks will focus on understanding and interacting with others, complemented by ecological momentary assessments and data from surveys and mobile sensing to capture real-time social interactions. This comprehensive approach seeks to clarify how developmental changes in the social brain correlate with shifts in social network positions, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying social development in adolescence."
