        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\" aims to enhance cooperation, a cornerstone for economic and societal prosperity, through an innovative economic engineering approach, as advocated by Alvin Roth. This initiative seeks to address critical cooperation issues in modern markets and societies using experimental methods and behavioral game theory. The project is structured into three work packages. The first package will focus on refining electronic reputation mechanisms to foster trust and cooperation in the digital domain, addressing the current flaws in Internet trust systems. The second package aims to develop mechanisms to prevent arms races for speed in real-time financial and electricity market trading, which can lead to wasteful collective behavior and threats to market liquidity and stability. The third package will explore market designs that align with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and the trading of pollution rights, to mitigate the public's distaste for certain types of transactions. The expected outcomes include the improved functioning of modern markets, significant advancements in the science of cooperation, and innovations in the field of behavioral economic engineering. Through these efforts, the project will contribute to more robust, ethical, and cooperative market systems."
