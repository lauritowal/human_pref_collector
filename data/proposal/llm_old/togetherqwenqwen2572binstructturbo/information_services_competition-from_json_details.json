        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Information Services: Competition and Externalities\" aims to deepen our understanding of the economic dimensions of information services, focusing on strategic interactions, the production and exchange of these services, and the externalities they generate. Key areas of exploration include one-sided and two-sided network externalities, the role of information as a public good, and the interplay between information services and physical infrastructures at both content and infrastructure levels. The project is structured into four parts: 1) Background theory, which examines two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities; 2) Virtual layer, investigating recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs using empirical methods and proprietary data from e-commerce platforms; 3) Physical layer, analyzing pricing and investment strategies with a focus on net-neutrality and data pricing; and 4) Competition policy, addressing regulatory challenges in two-sided markets. The approach combines the development of theoretical frameworks, empirical investigations, and the creation of dynamic investment models to provide actionable insights for policymakers. This comprehensive study seeks to illuminate the complex interdependencies within the information services ecosystem, ultimately fostering a more informed and effective regulatory environment."
