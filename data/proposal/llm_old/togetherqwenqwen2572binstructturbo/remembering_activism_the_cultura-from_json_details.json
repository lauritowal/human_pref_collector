        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\" (ReAct) seeks to deliver the first comprehensive analysis of how activism has been remembered and forgotten in Europe from the late 19th century to the present. By focusing on three pivotal periods—1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012—ReAct aims to reveal the continuities and changes in the depiction of protest across different media regimes. The project will explore the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in shaping the memory of protest, and how this memory influences subsequent social movements. Utilizing innovative methods, such as network visualization, to map the reproduction of narratives and references, ReAct will contribute to a major reorientation in cultural memory research. This project will develop new analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope and open up a new area of social movement research, providing critical literacies to understand the dynamics of collective memory and identity. Through these endeavors, ReAct will enrich our understanding of how the past informs and energizes contemporary activism."
