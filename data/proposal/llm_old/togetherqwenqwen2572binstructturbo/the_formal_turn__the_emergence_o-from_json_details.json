        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\" is a comprehensive research project in the field of Philosophy of Science and Logic, focusing on the interdisciplinary and comparative study of early formalist contributions during the first half of the twentieth century. This project is structured into three interconnected subprojects. The first, \"Historical Reconstruction,\" examines the foundational developments in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology (1860-1910), with a focus on key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The second subproject, \"Comparative Study,\" delves into the formal turn in logic and the rise of logical empiricism (1920-1940), highlighting the contributions of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. Finally, the third subproject, \"Analysis of Philosophical Implications,\" explores the broader impact of formalism on contemporary issues in semantics, model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. This project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the formal turn and its enduring significance in the philosophy of science and logic."
