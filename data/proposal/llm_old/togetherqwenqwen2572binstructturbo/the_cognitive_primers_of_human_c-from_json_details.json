        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"The Cognitive Primers of Human Culture: A Comparative Approach to the Emergence of Innovations,\" aims to investigate the cognitive and environmental factors that drive the development of innovative behaviors, specifically the creation and use of sharp stone tools (flakes), among primates. By defining the baseline stone manipulation abilities of chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques using artificial intelligence coding methods, the project seeks to elucidate the roles of exposure and experience in fostering innovation. Employing a triangulation approach, the study will implement an experimental paradigm with large sample sizes (N=350) and long-term testing protocols spanning approximately four years. The results will be compared to the oldest known human stone tools to trace the divergence in cognitive capacities between humans and other primates. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, including Structural Equation Models, this research promises to enhance our understanding of the conditions necessary for the emergence of innovations and the cognitive foundations of human culture."
