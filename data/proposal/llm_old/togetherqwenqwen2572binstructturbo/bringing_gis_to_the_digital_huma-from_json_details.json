        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\" seeks to pioneer methodologies for integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the analysis of unstructured texts, thereby enriching the field of Digital Humanities. Led by an experienced team proficient in Digital Humanities and Historical GIS, this initiative aims to explore how textual sources, when analyzed within a GIS framework, can offer novel insights into spatial and temporal dynamics of human activities and perceptions. The project will conduct two case studies: one focusing on the English Lake District across the Romantic era, examining shifts in landscape perception and representation; and another investigating the mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales, considering socio-economic changes and political interventions. Methodologies will combine advanced GIS techniques with corpus linguistics to analyze a wide range of textual sources, from ancient manuscripts to modern newspapers and e-resources. The outcomes of this project are expected to have a significant impact, not only by advancing the integration of GIS in humanities research but also by fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and enhancing public engagement through short courses, expert meetings, and conferences. This project promises to redefine the scope and capabilities of the Spatial Humanities, opening new avenues for research and application in multiple disciplines."
