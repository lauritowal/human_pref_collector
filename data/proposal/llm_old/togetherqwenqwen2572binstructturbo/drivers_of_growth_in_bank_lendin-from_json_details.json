        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\" aims to empirically investigate the factors contributing to strong credit growth and subsequent banking crises. Despite a consensus on the need to tighten financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension, there is a lack of decisive empirical evidence linking specific financial practices to the amplification of negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector. Key ingredients suspected of fostering these crises include financial innovations, loan securitization, a mortgage lending boom, real estate price increases, inadequate borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios. This project seeks to fill the empirical gap by identifying and estimating the impact of each factor on loan growth, utilizing exceptional micro-level datasets. Where necessary, a theoretical framework will be provided to guide the analysis. The project will also assess potential interactions and combinations of these ingredients, focusing primarily on credit growth. To ensure external validity, individual dataset settings and methodologies will be carefully considered. This research is crucial for developing more effective regulatory policies to mitigate the risks of future financial crises."
