        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization Leading to Violence\" aims to address the critical issues of violent extremism within the framework of the UN Decade of Action (2020-2030). This initiative recognizes the theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings in current research, such as a lack of consensus on the nature and causes of radicalization, limited access to key populations, and research designs that fail to establish causality. To overcome these challenges, the project is structured into four work packages: WP1 focuses on developing a comprehensive multi-theory model of radicalization and deradicalization processes; WP2 aims to innovate methodologies for data collection; WP3 involves empirical research through interviews and experiments in ten nations, including Spain, Iraq, and Indonesia, to examine radicalization mechanisms both inside and outside prisons; and WP4 is dedicated to creating evidence-based programs for prevention and deradicalization. This project will significantly enhance scientific understanding by collecting unique empirical data from violent extremist offenders globally and will provide novel, evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism, thereby contributing to global peace and security."
