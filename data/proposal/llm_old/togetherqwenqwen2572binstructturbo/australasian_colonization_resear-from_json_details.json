        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\" project seeks to unravel the mysteries surrounding the earliest human colonization of Australasia by modern humans around 50,000 years ago, a period marked by significant seafaring activities. This multidisciplinary endeavor, integrating archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics, aims to explore the when, where, who, and how of this early seafaring. The research will focus on the submerged palaeolandscape of the Sunda (South East Asia) and Sahul (Australasia) continental shelves, aiming to identify potential submerged prehistoric sites and enhance our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. By combining offshore and onshore environmental research, along with archaeogenetic studies targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, the project seeks to refine our knowledge of the regionâ€™s onshore and offshore environments, provide deeper insights into human origins and migration patterns, and shed light on the seafaring technology and social organization of these early mariners. This research is crucial for resolving key questions about the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the first known instances of 'open water' crossings, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of human history and prehistoric technological and cognitive advancements."
