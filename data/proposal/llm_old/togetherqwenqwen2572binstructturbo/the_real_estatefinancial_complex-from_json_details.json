        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Real Estate/Financial Complex,\" seeks to explore the under-researched connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement, particularly since 2007. The project aims to bridge the research gap by examining the intricate relationships and interactions across different scales, from local to global. We introduce the metaphor of the \"real estate/financial complex\" to encapsulate these multifaceted dynamics, emphasizing the qualitative and quantitative shifts that have occurred over the past decade and a half.\n\nThe research team will consist of a Postdoctoral Researcher and three PhD students. The Postdoc will conduct internationally comparative research, focusing on the quantitative and qualitative changes in the complex. Each PhD student will undertake national mappings of the complex and local/urban case studies, covering two countries each, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Principal Investigator (PI) will concentrate on the qualitative shift towards real estate and finance, the evolving role of the state, and the global dimensions of the complex.\n\nBy integrating these research components, the project aims to offer a nuanced and robust conceptualization of the real estate/financial complex, contributing to a deeper understanding of its implications for economic stability, urban development, and governance. This interdisciplinary approach will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars, ultimately enhancing our ability to manage and mitigate the risks associated with these interconnected sectors."
