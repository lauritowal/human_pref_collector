        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning,\" seeks to explore the empirical implications of a novel theoretical framework concerning the early representational preconditions and the functional architecture of mechanisms for understanding other minds. Contrary to standard theories, which posit that representing others' mental states is effortful and late-developing, primarily to explain behavior, our approach suggests that these processes are automatic and effortless, deeply rooted in real-time cooperative social interactions. Recent evidence, including our own findings, indicates that infants as young as 7 months can compute others' beliefs, even when not necessary for the task at hand, challenging the traditional timeline and function of these cognitive abilities.\n\nThe project aims to delve into the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, chart their developmental trajectory, and investigate the implications of the proposal that the system's primary domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. By employing a combination of behavioral and neuroscientific methods, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the cognitive and brain mechanisms that underpin social mind functions, with a specific focus on automatic processes in social interactions. Key references include seminal works by Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and forthcoming research by Kov√°cs et al. (in press, Science)."
