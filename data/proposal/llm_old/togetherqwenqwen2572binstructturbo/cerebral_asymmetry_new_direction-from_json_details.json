        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to advance our understanding of functional cerebral asymmetry, particularly in the context of impaired language development. Building on 150 years of research since Broca's seminal findings, our project will test the network efficiency hypothesis, which posits that the efficiency of neural networks is a critical factor in the development of language functions and their lateralization in the brain. \n\nWe will conduct a series of studies using a combination of genetic and neuropsychological approaches. Project A will employ behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify individual differences in the lateralization patterns of language functions. Project B will predict that individuals with language and literacy impairments are likely to have different language functions represented in opposite hemispheres. Project C will use simulations from genetic models to explore twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization. Project D will investigate the double hit genetic model, hypothesizing that neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise when there are multiple genetic hits on a functional brain circuit, focusing on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin due to an extra sex chromosome. Finally, Project E will focus on individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality, searching for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements that may underlie these deviations. This comprehensive approach aims to uncover the complex interplay between genetics and brain function in language development and disorders."
