        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" project aims to create an online, interactive, and comprehensive library of all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse from approximately 670–1100 CE. This digital resource will consolidate over 60,000 lines of poetry, equally divided between Old English and Anglo-Latin, with a focus on both named poets and anonymous works. The library will feature advanced TEI P5 XML markup to enhance accessibility and scholarly analysis. By documenting the influence of 50 named poets and tracing the potential influence of anonymous verses, this project seeks to deepen our understanding of the cultural and linguistic dynamics during a period when Latin and the vernacular co-existed in a Christian context across Europe. The library will be enriched with digital resources, including sound and image files, and will support a series of conferences and workshops to foster academic collaboration and public engagement. The ultimate goal is to publish a series of comprehensive multilingual corpora, making this invaluable resource accessible to scholars and enthusiasts worldwide."
