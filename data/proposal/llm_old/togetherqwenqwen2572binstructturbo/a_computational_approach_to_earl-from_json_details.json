        "**Abstract**\n\nThe proposal \"A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping\" aims to construct and validate a computational model that simulates the early language acquisition process in infants. This interdisciplinary project focuses on infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months and will utilize speech databases from Japanese, French, and Dutch to refine the model. By integrating machine learning, automatic speech recognition, and neuroscientific methods such as EEGs and fNIRS, the project will explore the coding features of speech, the segmentation of words in raw speech, and the predictive modeling of coarticulation processes. The model will iteratively integrate approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules, with assessments conducted on both adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases. Additionally, the project includes subprojects dedicated to defining coding features at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels, understanding the unique characteristics of the infant lexicon, and developing a reverse coarticulation model. The effectiveness of the model will be tested through behavioral studies and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers, as well as through the use of artificial languages and a longitudinal study. This research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of early language acquisition and provide a robust foundation for future studies in computational linguistics and infant cognition."
