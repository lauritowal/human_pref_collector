        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms\" (MERLIT) project aims to undertake the first systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation of meritocratic narratives in literature. This research seeks to address significant gaps in current scholarship, particularly the lack of attention to the formal principles underlying these narratives, the narrow focus on Western contexts, and the concentration on recent developments. MERLIT will explore the practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques, expanding the contextual focus to include the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts, and engaging with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present. Divided into six work packages, the project will integrate insights from literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation to offer a comprehensive literary history of meritocratic thought. By advancing our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing, MERLIT aims to highlight literature's worldmaking role, providing a nuanced perspective on how meritocratic narratives are enmeshed with structures of domination and privilege. This interdisciplinary endeavor is poised to contribute significantly to global discussions on meritocracy and its cultural manifestations."
