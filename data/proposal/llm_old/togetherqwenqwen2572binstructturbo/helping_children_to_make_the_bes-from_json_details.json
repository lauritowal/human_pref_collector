        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe ERC-team (ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay) proposes \"Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School,\" an innovative project aimed at addressing critical issues such as peer rejection, victimization, and low support from teachers, which often lead to problems in self-regulation and stress-regulation among students transitioning to high school. The project introduces A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to provide a realistic yet safe virtual high school environment where students can uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, engage in prosocial interactions, practice perspective-taking, and consider multiple response options, all while focusing on long-term perspectives. The game's appeal lies in its use of engaging game elements and its user-friendly presentation on a tablet computer. The primary goals of the project are to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game, assess its effectiveness, integrate it into ongoing school transition trainings, and develop a marketing strategy for broader implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. To achieve these goals, the project will collaborate with three school counseling organizations and target three regions in The Netherlands. Through these efforts, we aim to equip students with the skills necessary to navigate the social and emotional challenges of high school, fostering a more positive and supportive educational environment."
