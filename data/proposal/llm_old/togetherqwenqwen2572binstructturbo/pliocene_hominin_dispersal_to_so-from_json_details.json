        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to Southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\" explores the early migration of hominins from East Africa to southern Africa, focusing on the adaptability of these early humans to diverse environments. This multidisciplinary study, spanning from 3.7 million years ago to the early Pleistocene, will investigate the role of geomorphological and palaeoecological changes, alongside dynamic models of past precipitation and vegetation, to understand the expansion and contraction of hominin ranges. Key hypotheses include the impact of East African wet and dry phases on the reproductive isolation of southernmost populations, the effects of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation on dispersal corridors, and the tectonic and hydrographic changes post-1.5 million years that led to the endemism of southern African hominins. By integrating anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of fossils, along with appraisals of species diversity and gene flow, this research aims to clarify the roles of environmental and genetic factors in the dispersal and evolution of early hominins, including potential descendants of *Australopithecus anamensis* and *Australopithecus afarensis*. The findings will provide critical insights into the early human capacity to thrive in varied environments, contributing to our understanding of human evolution and dispersal patterns."
