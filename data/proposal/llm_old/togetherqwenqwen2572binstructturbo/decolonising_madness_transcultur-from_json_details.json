        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\" seeks to explore the historical and inter-disciplinary dimensions of the emergence and evolution of transcultural psychiatry and the concept of a global psyche. Focusing on the post-WWII and decolonisation periods, this research aims to critically examine the universality and cross-cultural applicability of mental health and illness, with a particular emphasis on the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement. By employing an inter-disciplinary and historical analysis approach, the project will address key research questions, including the redefinition of culture, race, and individual psyche post-WWII, the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe, and the extent to which new global and transcultural psychiatry truly departed from colonial frameworks. Expected outcomes include a clearer definition of universal psychological mechanisms, fostering an inclusive dialogue between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and the development of new cross-cultural models of the mind. This project aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the historical and cultural dynamics that have shaped the field of global mental health."
