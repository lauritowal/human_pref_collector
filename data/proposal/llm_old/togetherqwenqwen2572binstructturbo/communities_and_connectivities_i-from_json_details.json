        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours\" aims to explore the genetic, social, and cultural dynamics of Iron Age populations in Britain (800 BC – AD 100) within the broader European context. By integrating advanced methodologies such as ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological perspectives, this interdisciplinary study seeks to map genetic clusters, address population movements, and explore inter-regional connectivity. The research will examine social dynamics, household compositions, familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. With a focus on analyzing 1,000 individuals from the UK and 250 from Europe, this project represents the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. The expected outcomes include a new vision of Iron Age communities and a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond, contributing significantly to the field of Iron Age European Archaeology. The team, comprising experts in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modeling, and cultural archaeology, is well-equipped to deliver these transformative insights."
