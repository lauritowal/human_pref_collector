        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal \"Inference in Microeconometric Models\" aims to advance the field of econometrics by developing robust inference methods for models that incorporate unobserved heterogeneity, leveraging the richness of longitudinal data. The project is structured into three main blocks. The first block focuses on enhancing the performance of statistical hypothesis tests in nonlinear models, a critical step towards more accurate and reliable inferences. The second block addresses the estimation of models for network data, providing formal results that treat network data as panel data, thus broadening the applicability of econometric methods to complex social and economic networks. The third block explores the non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models, accounting for unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables, which is essential for understanding dynamic decision-making processes. The proposed methods will be applied to real-world scenarios, such as labor force participation and the import and export behavior of firms and countries, to demonstrate their practical utility. Theoretical assessments and simulations will be used to validate the new methods, ensuring they are both theoretically sound and empirically robust. This project will significantly contribute to the understanding of how unobserved differences between economic agents drive differences in economic outcomes, such as schooling decisions, wages, and employment durations."
