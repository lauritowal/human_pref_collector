        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Wage Inequality Within and Across Firms: The Role of Market Forces, Government, and Firm Policies,\" examines the multifaceted causes of wage inequality in industrialized countries, with a focus on trends observed over the past decades. The study will delve into the increasing wage disparities between firms and persistent gender gaps, particularly exacerbated by factors such as the arrival of children. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning four decades, including German social security records, survey data, and administrative data, the project is structured into three interrelated components. Project A will analyze the impact of market forces, such as product market competition and technological changes, on firm selection, reallocation, and differential wage growth. Project B will assess how government policies, including minimum wage laws and business tax rate adjustments, influence similar dynamics. Lastly, Project C will explore the effects of firm-level policies, such as family-friendly measures and flexible working hours, on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories post-childbirth, considering firm environments characterized by supportive coworker attitudes and egalitarian gender norms. This research aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers and firms to address and mitigate wage inequality."
