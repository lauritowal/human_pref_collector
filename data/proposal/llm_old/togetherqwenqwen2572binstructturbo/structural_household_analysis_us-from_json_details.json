        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\" project aims to advance the understanding of intrahousehold decision-making processes by integrating marriage market dynamics into a non-unitary structural model of households. Utilizing a nonparametric approach, this research will develop an empirical toolkit for analyzing household consumption patterns, focusing on the integration of revealed preference restrictions with the nonparametric estimation of demand systems. The primary objectives are to open the intrahousehold \"black box\" using aggregate consumption information, avoid restrictive parametric assumptions on decision processes, and provide a detailed description of the intrahousehold decision-making process. By leveraging pooled cross-section data sets, the project addresses significant challenges such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions. This innovative approach promises to enhance the accuracy and robustness of household consumption analysis, contributing to both theoretical advancements and practical applications in economics."
