        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health\" aims to conduct a socio-historical study of the transitional period in health governance from the post-World War II era to the 1980s. This critical transition marked a shift from a regime focused on disease eradication through UN organizations to one characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, and the rise of market-driven regulations and private-public alliances. By examining key focus areas such as tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics, the project will employ historical and anthropological methods to explore the changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the developments in non-Western countries, with a particular emphasis on India. The research seeks to include a broad spectrum of social worlds, including laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. It will also approach global health as a practice translated and emerging from local contexts, exploring various levels of circulation beyond traditional North-South transfers. Ultimately, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the transition from the Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty, enriching our knowledge of global health governance."
