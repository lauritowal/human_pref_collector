        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"The Legal Status of Religious Minorities in the Euro-Mediterranean World (5th-16th Centuries)\" aims to collect, publish, and study legal texts that define the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe and the Euro-Mediterranean region. Spanning from the 5th to the 16th centuries, this initiative will focus on Christian, Muslim, and other religious minorities, utilizing a wide array of sources including Roman law, canon law, national or royal law, urban law, rabbinical responsa, and fatwa collections. Specific texts such as the Theodosius Code, Justinian Code, and the Siete Partidas will be analyzed in their original languages, as well as in English, French, and Spanish translations. The project will produce a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, and host workshops and an international conference, culminating in comparative thematic studies and a sourcebook of selected legal texts. A monograph on the legal status of minorities will also be published. This comprehensive resource aims to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research, serving scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations, and providing a major reference tool for the field."
