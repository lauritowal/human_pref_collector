        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\" aims to explore the dynamic and multifaceted nature of fisher movements and practices across China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. This study challenges the assumption that fishers are mere instruments of state agendas by employing a novel theoretical and methodological framework that recognizes fishers as mobile maritime actors. Through fine-grained ethnography, the research will examine the transoceanic expansion of fishing practices, the adoption of radical marine harvesting techniques, and the development of transoceanic networks. It will focus on four key categories of fisher: Fisher, Poacher, Trader, and Smuggler, with particular attention to Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers. The study will also investigate the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood and the role of shore-based nodal points in facilitating these activities. By integrating thalassographic analysis with the concept of relational and shifting multiple mobilities, this project aims to provide significant scientific insights and inform policy-making, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the complex marine socio-ecological systems."
