        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"STUDACT: Students’ Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education (GCE)\" aims to transform education systems, empower learners, and build peaceful, inclusive societies by fostering mutual understanding between diverse populations. Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target year of 2030, STUDACT addresses the gap in systematic research on how students integrate GCE into their daily lives. The project hypothesizes that student engagement with GCE is influenced by personal traits and contextual factors. Through a multi-method approach, including group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis, STUDACT will collect data in six countries—Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK. This research will analyze policies and curricula at various governance levels to understand how they shape student perceptions and behaviors. Key research questions explore the variances in student understanding and appropriation of GCE across different backgrounds, curricula, and education systems. By treating students as active partners, STUDACT seeks to provide a comprehensive baseline of student perspectives, informing the development of more effective and inclusive GCE programs."
