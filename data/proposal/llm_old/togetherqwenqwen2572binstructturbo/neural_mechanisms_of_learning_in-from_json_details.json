        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols\" aims to elucidate the neural underpinnings of learning in infants, focusing on the critical period from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. This research will explore how infants, as learners, develop the ability to process language and engage in complex social interactions, leveraging their unique cerebral architecture and emerging access to a rich symbolic system. The project is structured into six work packages: WP1 will investigate statistical inferences in infants using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms; WP2 will examine how different pre-term environments affect early statistical computations; WP3 will delve into the neural bases of word meaning and category inference; WP4 will define criteria for infant symbolic competency; WP5 will use MRI to identify functional localization and maturational markers; and WP6 will develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis. By integrating advanced neuroimaging techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography, this project seeks to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture that is essential for human learning from the very onset of cortical circuits. This comprehensive approach will provide a deeper understanding of the infant brain's capacity to learn and adapt, with implications for early education and intervention strategies."
