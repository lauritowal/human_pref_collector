        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\" aims to write a new history of Roman legal culture during the period of Late Antiquity. This interdisciplinary endeavor, involving three research teams, focuses on the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of imperial legislation, with an emphasis on understanding the motivations behind these laws. Key elements of the project include investigating the persistence of a sophisticated legal culture, the role of classical jurists, and the relationship between contemporary legal texts and the works of Roman jurists.\n\nThe project will undertake a series of activities, including the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, hosting workshops with European scholars, and concluding with an international conference on the legal culture of Late Antiquity. Expected outputs include a comprehensive collection of jurists' writings, a monograph exploring the historical and geographical aspects of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Emperor Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings from the final conference. Through these efforts, the project seeks to provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity, highlighting its significance and the intricate processes of manuscript transmission that sustained it."
