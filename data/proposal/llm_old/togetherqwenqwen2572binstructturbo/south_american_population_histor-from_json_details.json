        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"South American Population History Revisited: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the Upper Amazon,\" seeks to explore the rich linguistic diversity of the Upper Amazon in western South America, a region marked by complex sociohistorical layers. By adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, the project aims to reconstruct and analyze geographical, socio-historical, and communicative aspects of the area's history. This comprehensive analysis will delve into the region's north and south, characterized by extreme linguistic diversity and evidence of local language contact, as well as its central part, dominated by three major language families. The investigation seeks to uncover significant past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamous practices, and trade, while also elucidating the intricate relationships between ecology, human behavior, and cognition. The project's findings will not only enhance our understanding of the social dynamics that have shaped the linguistic landscape of the Upper Amazon but also provide a broader window into the historical and cultural processes that have influenced human societies in this region."
