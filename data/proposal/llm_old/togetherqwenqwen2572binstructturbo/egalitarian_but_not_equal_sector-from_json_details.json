        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\" (WAGE) aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining, focusing on the metal and nursing sectors in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Despite global and European efforts, the average gender pay gap (GPG) remains at 20% globally and 13% in Europe, according to the United Nations (2022) and Eurostat (2022). This research will employ ethnographic methods to uncover the mechanisms and daily practices that influence wage outcomes in these sectors. The primary objectives are to compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three countries, analyze the practices leading to wage increases in both male-dominated and female-dominated sectors, and document how actors in these sectors perceive and respond to wage norms and gendered wage differentials. By deepening our understanding of these dynamics, WAGE seeks to inform policies and practices that can reduce the GPG and promote more equitable wage formation."
