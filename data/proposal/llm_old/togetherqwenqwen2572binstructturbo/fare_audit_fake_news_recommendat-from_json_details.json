        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe FARE_AUDIT project, titled \"Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results,\" aims to develop an innovative auditing tool that addresses the critical issue of disinformation spread through search engines. By simulating diverse online user profiles, the system will analyze how browsing history influences search results and the likelihood of exposure to disinformation. Key features of this tool include a privacy-protecting web-crawler that does not require real user data, ensuring ethical standards are maintained. The project seeks to bridge the gap in understanding how search algorithms can inadvertently promote disinformation, thereby empowering democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens with the ability to detect and monitor such content in near real-time. Additionally, FARE_AUDIT will contribute to the technological shift from traditional cookie-tracking to more advanced fingerprinting methods, enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of disinformation tracking. The anticipated outcomes include increased public awareness of the role search engines play in the spread of disinformation and the provision of robust tools for organizations to combat this issue."
