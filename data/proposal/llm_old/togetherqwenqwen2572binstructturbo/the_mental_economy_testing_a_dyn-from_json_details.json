        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project aims to revolutionize our understanding of working memory by exploring a novel theoretical framework that considers the dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling of the visible world. Challenging the dominant theory, which focuses solely on the absence of information, this project proposes an \"internal mental economy\" model where observers minimize internal storage to maintain perceptual homeostasis, balancing cognitive resources against environmental interactions. Using advanced techniques such as electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality, the project will employ innovative experimental paradigms that involve real-time interaction with the physical environment. Additionally, the study will examine patients with specific deficits to validate the model's components and apply machine learning to uncover biometric signatures in eye movements. The outcomes of this research are expected to significantly enhance our ability to diagnose working memory disorders and deepen our understanding of human interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments."
