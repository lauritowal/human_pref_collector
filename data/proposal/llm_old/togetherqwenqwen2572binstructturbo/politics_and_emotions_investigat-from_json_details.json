        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively\" (POLEMIC) project seeks to explore the impact of emotional appeals on political choices and the evolution of such appeals over time. Spanning from 1945 to the present, this research will analyze data from nine countries to address critical questions about the role of emotions in politics. By employing a dual perspective—macro (what politicians say) and micro (how citizens respond)—POLEMIC will test theories such as the vote-maximizing strategy, the influence of politicians' personalities, and the potential for emotional appeals to be a fashionable trend. Utilizing innovative methods including automated text analysis and physiological measurements, the project aims to bridge the fields of party politics and political psychology. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making processes and the rationality behind politicians' increasing use of emotional appeals. POLEMIC will extend existing theories and provide new insights into the conditions under which emotional appeals are most effective and when they may hinder political persuasion."
