        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires\" (GoviB) seeks to explore the dynamics of governance in ancient Babylon from the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC, a period marked by the successive reigns of the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian empires. Central to this study is the examination of how local negotiation influenced imperial rule and the strategies rulers employed to manage periods of instability or stability. The project faces the challenge of incomplete and often conflicting historical data, necessitating a meticulous approach to data interpretation. Utilizing a governance studies conceptual framework, the research will draw on rich textual materials from Neo-Babylonian archives and archaeological findings from German excavations in Babylon, complemented by artifacts from the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin. The primary goals of GoviB are to deepen our understanding of the politics and authority in Babylon, evaluate the impact of empires on cultural transformation, and challenge modern perceptions of oriental governance and regime stability. This interdisciplinary project aims to contribute significantly to the fields of ancient history, political science, and cultural studies."
