        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Modelling and maintaining maternal mental health\" (HealthyMom) project aims to advance our understanding of the neurobiological and psychosocial impacts of pregnancy loss on womenâ€™s mental health. Our primary objectives are to study the brain changes associated with unwanted terminated pregnancies, understand the reversal of motherhood-related neural modifications post-pregnancy loss, and identify the traces and determinants of mental health issues following such events. We will achieve these goals through a comprehensive, longitudinal study that involves repeated brain imaging, hormonal assessments, and detailed mental health monitoring of women who have experienced early miscarriage or stillbirth. Additionally, we will perform whole genome sequencing of the participants and their partners to uncover neurogenetic signatures linked to mental health vulnerabilities. By integrating multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, we aim to reveal the intricate relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of female-specific brain dynamics, the identification of neurogenetic markers for mental disorder vulnerability, and the discovery of potential targets for maintaining maternal mental health. This project holds significant implications for women's health and indirectly for the health of future offspring, contributing to the development of more effective interventions and support systems for women who experience pregnancy loss."
