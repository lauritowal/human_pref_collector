        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa,\" seeks to investigate the Bantu Expansion, a significant but controversial phenomenon that reshaped the linguistic, cultural, and ecological landscapes of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa over the past 5,000 years. The project aims to understand the establishment of the first Bantu-speaking village communities in the Late Holocene, focusing on the timing, location, and archaeological signature of these early villagers. Fieldwork will be conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola, integrating disciplines such as archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics.\n\nKey research areas include the interaction between early Bantu villagers and indigenous hunter-gatherers, as well as the subsistence, diet, and habitat of these communities. The linguistic component will employ lexical reconstruction to explore aspects of subsistence and land use. Interuniversity collaboration will facilitate a holistic view, incorporating archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data. Phylogenetic modeling will be used to enhance our understanding of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in the region. This project not only addresses fundamental questions in human history but also has significant political and social implications, contributing to a more nuanced narrative of Africa's past."
