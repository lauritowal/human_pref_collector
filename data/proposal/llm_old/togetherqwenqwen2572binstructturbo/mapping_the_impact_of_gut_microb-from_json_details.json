        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\" seeks to explore the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and brain function, focusing on the neurotransmitter GABA. Despite humans sharing 99% genetic identity, the gut microbiota can vary by 40-90% between individuals, significantly influencing brain and behavior. This project addresses a critical knowledge gap regarding the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters, such as GABA, on the central nervous system.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach, integrating psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, employs a biochemically informed method to investigate how gut bacteria modulate brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance in human adults. Utilizing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, we will directly measure brain GABA levels and evaluate cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Additionally, we will conduct a four-week intervention study to assess the impact of ingesting custom-made GABA-producing probiotics on brain function and behavior.\n\nBy elucidating the mechanisms through which gut bacteria and probiotics influence brain GABA levels and function, this research aims to advance our understanding of individual differences in human behavior and brain function, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders."
