        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period,\" aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the physiological, cognitive, and psychological changes that occur in women as they transition into motherhood. The project will employ a prospective longitudinal design, with data collection at five time points, including one pre-pregnancy, two intra-pregnancy, and two postpartum sessions. The primary objectives are to map the onset and evolution of brain changes in pregnant women, characterize the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, and assess the impact of environmental and psychological factors on maternal adaptations. The study will also identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations and integrate the findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. The participant groups include nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy, and control nulliparous women. The project will deliver a longitudinal RDoC-based model at its conclusion, intermediate longitudinal evaluations post-postpartum, and cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy and postpartum sessions. This research will provide critical insights into the multifaceted process of becoming a mother, contributing to the development of targeted interventions and support systems for pregnant women and new mothers."
