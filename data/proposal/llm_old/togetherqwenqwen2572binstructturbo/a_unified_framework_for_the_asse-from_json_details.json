        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\" aims to address the proliferation and idiosyncratic application of cognitive modeling techniques by developing a comprehensive program for their evaluation and use. This initiative will tackle the unclear state-of-the-art in cognitive modeling through the creation of a unified framework grounded in Bayesian inference. The project will focus on key models such as drift decision, stop-signal race, and reinforcement learning models, enhancing their application through the construction of plausible parameter priors, the development of diagnostic experiments, and the assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs. By integrating these methods into JASP, a popular statistical software, the project will not only set a new standard for cognitive modeling but also make advanced techniques accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners. The outcomes of this project will significantly contribute to the fields of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, ensuring that cognitive models are applied more effectively and consistently."
