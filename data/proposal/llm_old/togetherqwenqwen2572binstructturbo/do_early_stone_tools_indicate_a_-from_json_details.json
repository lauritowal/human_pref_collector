        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"STONECULT: Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture?\" seeks to address the fundamental question of when forms of culture first arose in our lineage. Cultural adaptations are pivotal for human colonization of the planet, and understanding their origins is a critical scientific challenge. While modern human technology relies heavily on cumulative culture, transmitted through high-fidelity social learning, evidence suggests that early hominin technology might have developed differently. The latent solutions model posits that early hominin stone tools could have emerged from individual problem-solving rather than cultural transmission, a hypothesis that has not been rigorously tested until now.\n\nSTONECULT aims to evaluate whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or are better explained by the latent solutions model. This will be achieved through a combination of top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, comparing early hominin technology with modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches. The project's hypotheses are that early stone tools do not represent cumulative culture (null hypothesis) and that they are best accounted for by the latent solutions model.\n\nThe potential impact of this research is significant, as it could transform our understanding of human cultural evolution. If the latent solutions model is confirmed, it would suggest that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, providing new insights into the cognitive and social capacities of early hominins. This work is poised to inform and engage fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology, offering a novel perspective on the origins of human culture."
