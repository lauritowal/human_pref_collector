        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe SCALEFORES project, titled \"Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping,\" aims to develop and test a novel methodological framework for mapping the intricate relationships between ecosystem services using existing data. The primary objectives are to address the significant challenge of reliably mapping these relationships and to enable multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. This will be achieved through the examination of scale-dependency in the relationships between ecosystem services and their underpinning social and ecological variables. The project will also create maps highlighting trade-offs and synergies between different ecosystem services. To ensure the robustness of the methodology, it will be validated against existing maps of ecosystem services across Europe, a region chosen for its comprehensive and high-quality data. By utilizing data sources such as land cover, soil type, and human population density, the project anticipates producing accurate maps of the relationships between ecosystem services, thereby enhancing the ability to map their distributions. The outcomes of SCALEFORES will provide critical insights and tools for policymakers and land managers to support sustainable and integrated landscape management."
