        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism,\" aims to empirically investigate the multifaceted influences on political decisions that lead to the rise of populist and extremist movements. The project is divided into three interconnected parts, each utilizing unique data sources to explore distinct aspects of these phenomena.\n\nIn the first part, we will examine how personal employment histories and the information environment impact voting behavior, particularly in the context of support for Donald Trump. This analysis will leverage a comprehensive database of over 40 million resumes from 2010 to 2016, combined with detailed zipcode-level economic and voting data.\n\nThe second part will delve into the influence of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas. By drawing on archival records of corporal punishment regulations in UK schools from the 1970s and 1980s, and correlating this with contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting, we aim to uncover the long-term effects of such experiences on political attitudes and behaviors.\n\nFinally, the third part will explore the factors that drive active resistance to extremist regimes, using a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda during WWII Germany. This part will shed light on the mechanisms that enable individuals and groups to resist oppressive regimes, even in the face of severe adversity.\n\nOverall, this project seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the economic, social, and historical factors that contribute to the rise and fall of populism and extremism, with implications for policy and prevention."
