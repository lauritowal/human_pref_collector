        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"OLFLINK\" project, titled \"Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption,\" aims to address the critical challenge of altering human dietary habits to enhance global health and sustainability. A major hurdle in this endeavor is the strong preference for familiar food flavors, often rooted in early olfactory and gustatory experiences. OLFLINK seeks to bridge the knowledge gap concerning the cortical processes that enable the transfer of appetitive properties from odors to tastes, focusing on the mechanisms of odor-taste associative learning. Through three nested levels of investigation, OLFLINK will explore the acquisition of new flavor preferences and the regulation of these preferences by signals from the digestive tract. The project's objectives include determining the distributed neural code for odor-taste associations, delineating the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieving these associations, and understanding the interactions with digestive feedback that influence the coding system. The outcomes of OLFLINK will facilitate the adjustment of food preferences based on nutritional needs, provide insights into the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and pave the way for developing novel interventions to promote dietary changes over the life course."
