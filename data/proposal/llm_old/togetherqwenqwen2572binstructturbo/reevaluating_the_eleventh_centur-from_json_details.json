        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\" aims to innovate the digital curation and creation of historical data, specifically targeting medieval history. By re-framing historical data as assertions linked to an authority, this project introduces a method that allows for the manipulation of data according to its source and authority, and the linking of these assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict. This approach is particularly novel in its acknowledgment of the complex, often disputed nature of pre-modern history. A key challenge addressed is the contextualization and efficient reuse of existing online data, aiming to minimize waste and enhance scholarly resources.\n\nFocusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), with a primary emphasis on the eastern half of Christendom and additional attention to newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe, this project seeks to uncover trans-regional trends that are often obscured by regional narratives. Through interdisciplinary research encompassing prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, the project aims to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive view of history, enabling historians to explore the period from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework. This initiative promises to enhance our understanding of medieval history and set a new standard for the digital handling of historical data."
