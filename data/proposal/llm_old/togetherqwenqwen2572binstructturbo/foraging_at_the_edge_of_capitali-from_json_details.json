        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\" seeks to develop a political ecology of foraging, an increasingly relevant practice in the Anthropocene, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing climate and biodiversity crises. Despite its global rise, foraging activities such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and the activities of Amazon nomads in the US, have received only patchy attention from mainstream discourse. This interdisciplinary project, grounded in anthropology and based at the Rachel Carson Center at LMU Munich, will explore foraging as both a socio-environmental entanglement and an economic strategy. Led by an international team of five researchers, the project aims to produce two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a documentary film, and a public exhibition. Through this comprehensive approach, the project will provide a nuanced understanding of foragingâ€™s role in contemporary global environmental and economic dynamics, offering insights that are crucial for sustainable development and policy-making."
