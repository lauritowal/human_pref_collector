        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions\" (InterCom) project seeks to explore the nuances of multigenerational communication through an innovative blend of laboratory research and real-world experimentation. This initiative aims to address fundamental questions, such as whether age-related differences in brain rhythms affect conversational flow and how listeners process speech from children and older adults. By collecting brain, body, and language data from diverse age groups during community storytelling events, InterCom will co-design these events with local partners to ensure cultural relevance and engagement. The project's methodology involves a reciprocal relationship between real-world observations and controlled laboratory studies, where findings from each setting inform and refine the other. The primary objectives include understanding the mechanisms of multigenerational communication and developing tools to enhance these interactions. InterCom's innovative approach tests a novel 'community neuroscience' model that leverages the strengths of naturalistic observations and experimental control, ultimately aiming to generate valuable insights and practical solutions for improving communication across generations."
