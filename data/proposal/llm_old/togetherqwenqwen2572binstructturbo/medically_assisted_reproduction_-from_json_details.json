        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults and Families\" aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) on family well-being. Over the last four decades, more than five million children have been born through MAR, reflecting a significant trend in reproductive practices. Despite this, the public health consequences of MAR remain understudied, with prior research yielding mixed results, low statistical power, and conceptual limitations.\n\nThis proposal outlines a robust research agenda to address these gaps. The project will conduct a comprehensive analysis, comparing outcomes across various life domains including physical health, mental health, education, and union stability. By utilizing innovative research designs, such as sibling comparisons between MAR-conceived and spontaneously conceived children, and adult comparisons between those who successfully and unsuccessfully underwent MAR, the study seeks to establish causality and provide a deeper understanding of MAR's effects.\n\nThe data will be sourced from comprehensive population registers and surveys, ensuring a broad and representative sample. The anticipated outcomes of this research are ground-breaking and have the potential to inform future studies, health advising, resource allocation, and policy-making. Health professionals, public health authorities, and policy-makers will benefit from the insights gained, which can lead to more informed decisions regarding MAR treatment subsidies and other supportive measures. This project is poised to make significant contributions to the field, enhancing the well-being of individuals and families affected by MAR."
