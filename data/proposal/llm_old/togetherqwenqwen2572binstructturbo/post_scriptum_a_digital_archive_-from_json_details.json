    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Post Scriptum\" project aims to create a digital archive focusing on personal letters from 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain, penned by individuals ranging from servants and children to soldiers and artisans. This initiative, involving systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic study, will utilize documents from institutions like the Inquisition and civil courts, complemented by sociological interviews. The archive will provide a well-contextualized study of inter-personal relations and traditional communities, highlighting oral rhetoric, emotional expression, and non-orthodox beliefs. Project outputs include a large, philologically treated collection, an online digital edition, and comprehensive cultural and linguistic analyses, adhering to Textual Criticism standards. This resource will offer unprecedented insights into the lived experiences and communications of ordinary people during a pivotal historical period."
