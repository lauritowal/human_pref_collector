        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Energy and Emissions Thresholds for Providing Decent Living Standards to All\" seeks to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts associated with achieving decent living standards globally. By operationalizing the concept of basic needs and advancing empirical validity through the analysis of household consumption patterns, the research will identify what constitutes 'decent living standards' and the specific energy resources required to achieve these standards in different countries. Utilizing lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling, this project will map the energy needs and climate-related emissions for the constituents of decent living, considering cultural, climatic, technological, and other contextual factors in five emerging economies. The study will also analyze the path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity, aiming to identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the development of knowledge on the energy requirements for decent living standards and the climate impacts of these requirements, helping to inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation efforts."
