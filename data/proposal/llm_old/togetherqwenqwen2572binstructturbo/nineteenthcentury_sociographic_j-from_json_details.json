        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\" aims to be the first comprehensive study to investigate the foundational role of sociographic journalism in the development of social sciences. By examining a rich corpus of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, this research will employ anthropological and historiographical approaches to analyze the representational techniques of sociographic journalism. It will explore the connections between these journalistic practices and broader epistemic developments, their embeddedness in specific socio-spatial settings, and their relationships with academic, artistic, and governmental projects. The project will also situate these journalistic sketches within the contexts of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines. The outcomes of this study will include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a published volume, and two monographs, collectively contributing to a deeper understanding of how sociographic journalism shaped ethnographic and sociological knowledge during a critical period of global transformation."
