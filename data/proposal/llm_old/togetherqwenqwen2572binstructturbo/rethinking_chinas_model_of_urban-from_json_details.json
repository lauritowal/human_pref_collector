        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance\" aims to explore the world-historical significance of China’s urban governance models through a comprehensive, multi-scalar investigation. Addressing both theoretical and policy challenges, the research will examine urban governance at the neighborhood, city, and regional levels, with a focus on strategic projects and the impact of trade tensions. Utilizing a blend of ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and collaboration with Chinese researchers and policymakers, the study will cover diverse regions including coastal, central, and western areas. Key case studies include Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. This project is timely, aligning with the UN-endorsed new urban agenda. It seeks to contribute to the theory of entrepreneurial urban governance and provide an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. The project will culminate in six workshops and a series of publications, offering a nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China, thereby reshaping global understanding of China’s urban governance."
