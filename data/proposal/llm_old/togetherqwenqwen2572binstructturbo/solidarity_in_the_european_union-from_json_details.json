        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project aims to develop and apply a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1) to critical issues within the EU, including free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). This project will provide a foundational understanding of solidarity, enhancing the EU’s cohesion and effectiveness in addressing contemporary challenges. By integrating theoretical insights with practical policy implications, the project seeks to foster a more equitable and resilient European Union."
