        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective,\" aims to develop a comprehensive Keynesian growth framework that integrates business cycle dynamics with long-term productivity growth. By merging Keynesian aggregate demand theory with modern endogenous growth models, this project seeks to advance understanding of how economic fluctuations and stabilization policies influence productivity. The research is divided into three main parts: (1) constructing a novel Keynesian growth model that incorporates state-of-the-art quantitative features of endogenous growth, (2) extending this framework to an open economy context to analyze the interplay between monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth, and (3) empirically testing the modelâ€™s predictions using data from the United States and a panel of advanced economies. The project will also include case studies, such as the effects of the Euro inception on capital flows and productivity in recipient countries, and the empirical response of productivity to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions. This research promises to provide critical insights into the mechanisms that drive economic growth and stability, informing policy decisions aimed at fostering sustainable and inclusive economic development."
