        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\" aims to explore the historical patterns and experiences of over one million boat refugees who sought asylum via sea routes from the 1940s to the present. Through a comprehensive analysis of key periods, including the Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean in the 1940s, the Vietnamese in the South China Sea during the 1970s and 1980s, and the Cubans and Haitians in the Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s, this study will address the central research question: How did notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space? The research will delve into sub-questions such as the roles of various actors in aiding or hindering refugees during their journeys. Key research points include the solidarity among refugees onboard, encounters with non-state actors, state responses at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary. The project's innovative approach \"thinks through seas\" and goes beyond state-centric perspectives, comparing experiences across different times and regions. Utilizing a rich array of sources, including interviews with refugees and actors, oral history, state and NGO archives, legal cases, and media coverage, this study promises to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding boat refugees and inform contemporary debates on asylum and migration."
