        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Towards a Computational Account of Natural Sequential Behavior,\" aims to advance our understanding of the computational principles underlying human perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks. The project will focus on developing sophisticated computational models that can identify and characterize the mechanisms involved in sequential actions, particularly those that involve perceptual uncertainty and action variability. By integrating methods from psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning, the research will explore how individuals make optimal sequential decisions in complex and uncertain environments.\n\nThe project will employ a range of tasks, including classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and a novel task—sandwich making—to study how subjects perceive and act in real-world settings. Through behavioral experiments, the research aims to recover subjects' perceptual uncertainties, their beliefs about tasks, and their subjective costs and benefits, including effort. This work builds on previous experimental and theoretical research, which has examined visuomotor behavior and modeled behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis. The outcomes of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of natural sequential behavior and have implications for fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science."
