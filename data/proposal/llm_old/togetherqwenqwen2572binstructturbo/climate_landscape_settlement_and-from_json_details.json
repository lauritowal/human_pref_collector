        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society: Exploring Human-Environment Interaction in the Ancient Near East\" (CLaSS) project aims to investigate the factors that influenced the differential persistence of societies in the Fertile Crescent over a 6,000-year period from 8,000 to 2,000 years before present. Covering an expansive 600,000 kmÂ², this hybrid research initiative integrates archaeological settlement and archaeobotanical data with General Circulation Models to explore the complex interplay between climate, population densities, distribution, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies. Utilizing advanced techniques in archaeological data science and big data, the CLaSS project seeks to construct comprehensive empirical datasets that will provide new insights into the sustainability and resilience of ancient societies in the face of both abrupt and longer-term climate changes. The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of how human societies adapt to environmental challenges, offering valuable lessons for contemporary issues of climate change and resource management."
