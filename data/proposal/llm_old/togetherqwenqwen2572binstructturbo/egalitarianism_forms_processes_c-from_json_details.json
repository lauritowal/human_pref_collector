        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons\" aims to explore the diverse manifestations and cultural underpinnings of egalitarian structures, processes, and values through an integrated approach combining library-based global comparative studies and field ethnographic research. This decentering orientation towards heterogeneity seeks to uncover the complexities and nuances of egalitarian practices, addressing perennial questions such as the role of the state, religion, economic distribution, and scale. By conducting research in both European and non-European contexts, the project will develop a comparative method that is responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances, and open to the varied conceptions and imaginations of egalitarianism. The ultimate goal is to enhance our understanding of the forces, contradictions, and limitations inherent in egalitarian practices, thereby contributing to a more nuanced and inclusive discourse on equality."
