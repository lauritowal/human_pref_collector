        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010,\" seeks to provide systematic empirical knowledge and develop explanations for changes in morality policies over a three-decade span. Focusing on 25 OECD countries, the study will explore shifts in legislation related to life and death issues (abortion, euthanasia), sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality), and addictive substances and behaviors. Utilizing a combination of macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies, the project aims to identify patterns and factors influencing policy changes, comparing developments across countries and subfields. Legislative output data will serve as the primary data source, with critical cases selected based on the results of the quantitative analysis for in-depth examination. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between international and domestic factors in shaping morality policies, offering valuable insights for policymakers and scholars alike."
