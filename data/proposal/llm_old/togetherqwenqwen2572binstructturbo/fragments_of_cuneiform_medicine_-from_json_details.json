        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Fragments of Cuneiform Medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity\" (BabMed) project aims to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform, focusing on its latest phase as preserved in the Aramaic text of the Babylonian Talmud. This project hypothesizes that cuneiform medical knowledge survived longer than previously believed and that much of the Aramaic medicine in the Talmud is derived from Akkadian sources. Utilizing native taxonomies and comparing these with neighboring medical systems, particularly Greek medicine, BabMed challenges the Eurocentric bias in current historical narratives. By overcoming barriers of script and language, this study will establish a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer in Late Antiquity, demonstrating how Babylonian medicine was preserved and transformed in the Talmud, reflecting the scientific thinking of both Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia. BabMed, as the largest ancient collection of medical data before Hippocrates, promises to enrich our understanding of ancient medical practices and their cultural exchanges."
