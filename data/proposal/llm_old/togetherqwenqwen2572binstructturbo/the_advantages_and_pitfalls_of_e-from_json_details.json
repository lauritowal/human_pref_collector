        "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement,\" aims to investigate the multifaceted impacts of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites, from both business and societal perspectives. Utilizing an empirical approach, the project will conduct both lab and field experiments to understand the mechanisms and effects of user engagement. Key objectives include determining the direct economic value of user engagement for businesses, assessing the broader societal implications of heightened user engagement expectations, and characterizing the effectiveness of calls to action across various product domains. Preliminary results indicate that calls to action significantly influence conversion rates and the amount of information users are willing to share. Through a collaboration with a leading freemium website-development service provider, this research seeks to deepen the economic and societal understanding of social computing, providing actionable insights for stakeholders and contributing to the broader discourse on digital interaction and its implications."
