        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES) project seeks to address critical issues in the allocation of responsibilities within international cooperative actions. By rethinking the mechanisms that govern the distribution of responsibilities among multiple actors, SHARES aims to mitigate the dilution of accountability that often undermines the effectiveness and integrity of international cooperative efforts. The project's primary objectives include developing a robust framework to ensure the protection of the international rule of law and providing effective remedies for parties harmed by collective actions. To achieve these goals, SHARES will employ a multifaceted approach, combining conceptual and theoretical analysis with empirical case studies. The research will focus on the principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible and will explore the processes by which (quasi-)judicial systems can better account for the complexities of collective international policies. Through these efforts, SHARES aims to provide actionable solutions that enhance the clarity and enforceability of responsibilities in international law, thereby strengthening the foundation of global cooperation."
