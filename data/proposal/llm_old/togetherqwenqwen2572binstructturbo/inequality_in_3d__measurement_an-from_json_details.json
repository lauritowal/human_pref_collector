        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Inequality in 3D – Measurement and Implications for Macroeconomic Theory\" aims to advance our understanding of inequality and its macroeconomic implications by measuring economic conditions at the granular level of individual households across three dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth. Utilizing novel microdata and applying sophisticated heterogeneous agent models, this research will contrast findings with those from traditional representative agent models to better quantify the micro heterogeneity that significantly impacts macroeconomic theory. The project's disciplined empirical approach, informed by recent modelling advancements, seeks to inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing novel insights that can enhance fiscal and monetary policy tools. Additionally, the findings will contribute to the ongoing debate on economic inequality and offer actionable lessons for policymakers aiming to address inequality effectively. By delving into the intricate interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, this project aspires to bridge the gap between microeconomic realities and macroeconomic theories, ultimately leading to more robust and equitable economic policies."
