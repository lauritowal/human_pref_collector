        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects\" aims to explore the role of effort in the reproduction of social inequality and to advance our understanding of intergenerational mobility. Specifically, the project seeks to determine the extent to which children’s effort levels vary by their parental socioeconomic background, whether these disparities can be attributed to the intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations, and to identify the most effective methods for measuring cognitive effort. Utilizing cutting-edge methodologies, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry, the study will collect experimental data from school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. The analysis will involve the triangulation of methodologies, cross-validation, and the examination of subjective effort dispositions using (inter)national surveys. This research is poised to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity, and offer valuable insights for educational practitioners. Ultimately, the findings will contribute to normative debates about social inequality and inform policy design aimed at improving equality of opportunity."
