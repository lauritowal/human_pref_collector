        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Towards an Evidence-Based Model for Big Data Policing,\" aims to address the critical knowledge gaps and fragmented expertise in big data policing within Europe. By integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive and evidence-based model for big data policing. The model will leverage variables such as previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to the nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity to predict high-risk crime locations and optimize resource deployment. The project will fill the current void in interdisciplinary research by conducting randomized controlled trials to scientifically evaluate the model's predictive reliability, validity, and effectiveness. Additionally, it will ensure that the model adheres to high legal and ethical standards, setting it apart from commercial and economic initiatives. The project will support four PhD tracks, each focusing on a core aspect of the model—statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical—thereby fostering a well-rounded and robust approach to big data policing. This innovative approach aims to provide a transparent and scientifically grounded framework that can significantly enhance public safety and trust in law enforcement."
