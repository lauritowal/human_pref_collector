        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis 5-year research project, titled \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict,\" aims to explore the complex dynamics between social media and conflict in non-urban areas, particularly in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa. The initiative seeks to extend Internet reach to remote, conflict-affected regions, providing affordable access to the world's poorest and areas with weak state presence. The project will delve into the critical question of how social media impacts peace-building efforts and the potential for perpetuating violence. Through a series of research questions, we will investigate how social media alters the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, the strategies of public authorities in using social media to either encourage violence or promote peace, and the evolving experiences of individuals with violent conflict in the digital age. The contexts of dangerous speech online, the movement of individuals into and out of conflict, and the tactics employed by various actors to shape the Internet and its governance will be central to our examination. This project will provide valuable insights into the role of social media in conflict zones, ultimately contributing to more informed and effective peace-building strategies."
