        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\" (MedPlaceboEffect) is a comprehensive research project aimed at exploring the intricate dynamics of medieval medicine and healing, particularly focusing on the placebo effect. This project will investigate the period from 1100 to 1500 in Southern Europe, a region characterized by a rich tapestry of cultural and religious influences that shaped healthcare practices. By employing a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures, MedPlaceboEffect seeks to identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect and to demonstrate its pervasiveness in the context of medieval healthcare.\n\nThe core concepts of hope, expectation for a cure, belief, trust, and the placebo effect will be analyzed to understand how these psychological and social factors influenced medical outcomes. The project aims to bridge historical and contemporary debates on the placebo effect, providing insights into the soul/mind impact on health and laying the foundation for a contemporary examination of healing practices. Additionally, MedPlaceboEffect will explore the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in the medieval health system, and how these elements have been negotiated and reinterpreted in the 21st century.\n\nBy addressing modern challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, this project aspires to contribute to a deeper understanding of the elements of therapy in medieval healing and their relevance to today's healthcare practices."
