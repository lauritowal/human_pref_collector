        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\" seeks to challenge and expand the traditional understanding of politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe, particularly focusing on Peninsular Italy. By employing a novel perspective that views inequality as a situational rather than overt phenomenon, this research aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of how social hierarchies were constructed and experienced during key periods from the Neolithic to the Iron Age (6000-600 BC). Utilizing methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, the project will analyze 200 individuals from each of the three designated periods: Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC). This empirical approach seeks to evaluate the impact of inequality on individual lives and to elucidate the role of ancestors in prehistoric societies. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to the broader discourse on the development of social structures and the cultural practices surrounding death in prehistoric Europe."
