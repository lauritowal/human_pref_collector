        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" project aims to enhance AI-assisted moderation of online hate speech and disinformation through innovative, community-driven methodologies. Addressing the critical issues of training data quality, scope, and inclusivity, as well as the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural context, our project introduces the AI4Dignity model. This model leverages a global comparative framework, integrating a community-based classification approach and fostering collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries. The primary goals are to significantly improve AI-assisted speech moderation, develop an open access toolkit, establish procedural benchmarks, operationalize the \"human in the loop\" principle, and create inclusive training datasets. By doing so, we aim to build a more resilient and respectful online environment, fostering dignity and dialogue across diverse communities."
