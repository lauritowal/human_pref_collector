        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Quantitative Models of Cities\" aims to advance the understanding of economic divergence across and within countries, particularly between urban and rural areas, with a focus on the 20th century. Recent developments in high-resolution data and theoretical advancements provide a unique opportunity to refine our models of urban economics. This proposal seeks to integrate quantitative models with detailed register data, specifically leveraging comprehensive Danish datasets that offer a rich, granular perspective on worker and firm heterogeneity. A key innovation of this project is the development of a dynamic model that can simulate the effects of various policy interventions. By combining these elements, the project will address critical policy questions, including the impact of urban transport infrastructure, the effect of height restrictions on city skylines, and the broader implications of planning interventions on urban development. Building on the foundational work of Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), this research aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers and contribute to the broader academic discourse on urban economics."
