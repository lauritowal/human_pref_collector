        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy: An Illustration of the Global Pharmaceutical Drug Market in Asia and Africa,\" aims to investigate the dynamics of the global drug market through a case study of ACTs in Benin, Ghana, and Cambodia. The project, integrating disciplines of Anthropology, Epidemiology, and Sociology, seeks to study the supply and demand realities of the global drug market, analyze globalizing processes affecting drug availability and use in Benin and Ghana, and assess the public health consequences of these dynamics. Additionally, the project will compare pharmaceutical systems and address the critical issue of the spread of ACT resistance from Asia to Africa. The work is structured into six work packages, including the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, drug use analysis, the scope of ACT consumption, local production and regulation of ACTs, an exploration of the Asian market, and project management with dissemination strategies. The project will engage 8 Masterâ€™s students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doctoral researcher, fostering a new generation of researchers. Leveraging the Principal Investigator's expertise in methodology and theory, along with solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, the project aims to contribute critical insights and recommendations for enhancing pharmaceutical systems in Africa and preventing the spread of drug resistance."
