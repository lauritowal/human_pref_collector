        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\" seeks to explore and document the unique life conditions in Zarzis, Tunisia, through a decolonial lens. This initiative focuses on understanding the end of lives in the Mediterranean context, specifically by examining key resources such as phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and the management of industrial waste. By adopting forensics as a method of deep, attentive study, the project aims to map unliveable life conditions, revealing the intricate interrelations between these vital elements and their impact on local communities and ecosystems.\n\nInnovatively, this project shifts the traditional focus of European-centric studies to an African perspective, challenging existing narratives and methodologies. It advances the concept of vital elements, integrating it into a broader framework of postcolonial and environmental justice. The project will involve collaborative efforts, including team site visits, methodological workshops, and partnerships with local artists at the Vital Elements Atelier, to ensure a holistic and culturally sensitive approach.\n\nThrough these activities, the project not only contributes to the academic discourse on forensics and environmental studies but also fosters community engagement and empowerment, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable and equitable resource management in the Mediterranean region."
