        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development\" project aims to address the significant disparities in public service access and quality, which contribute to an estimated 5.7 million annual deaths and 100 million people falling into poverty, as reported by the Lancet Health Commission (2018). While high-income countries have made impressive strides in adopting digital technologies, low-income countries face challenges, with one-third of digitalization projects abandoned (World Development Report, 2016). This project seeks to identify the determinants of success or failure in digitalization efforts and enhance the efficiency and inclusivity of public service delivery. Through collaboration with local governments and NGOs, we will conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, focusing on the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. The research aims to inform public policy in low-income countries, ensuring that digitalization efforts are sustainable and inclusive, thereby expanding access to higher quality public services for a broader population segment."
