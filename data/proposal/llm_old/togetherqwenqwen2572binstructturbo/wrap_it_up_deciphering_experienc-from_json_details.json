        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Wrap It Up: Deciphering Experience-Dependent Myelin Growth Across Development\" (WRAPPED) project aims to elucidate the dynamic changes in myelin during learning and development. This pioneering study will employ a comprehensive approach, integrating local longitudinal research with the analysis of large-scale open data to assess myelin changes within the living human brain over time and across different developmental stages. Key focus areas include evaluating myelin alterations as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when individuals of various ages acquire new skills, such as juggling or reading Chinese. By using advanced MRI technology, WRAPPED seeks to uncover the biological underpinnings of the unique human learning trajectory and to establish a critical reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. This project promises to significantly advance our knowledge of brain development and its implications for learning and cognitive disorders."
