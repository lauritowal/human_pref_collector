        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\" aims to address the critical issues of environmental quality and regulatory impact in the context of global climate change and the increasing public demand for cleaner air. By focusing on the combustion of fossil fuels as a primary source of pollution, this interdisciplinary study will develop new tools for economic impact analysis, integrating causal inference on pollution emissions with advanced chemical transport models. This approach will enhance the spatial detail of economic damage estimates, incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts. The project is divided into two main parts: the first examines the economic implications of local air quality changes resulting from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, while the second assesses the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration patterns. The overarching objective is to provide robust empirical evidence to inform and enhance environmental policy-making in areas such as climate policy and air quality management. The expected outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly influence global environmental problems and contribute to a more sustainable future."
