        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships of Transgender People,\" aims to investigate the profound impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on the psychosocial functioning and social relationships of transgender individuals. Given the high rates of social disruption and suicide risk within this population, this research is crucial for advancing transgender health and well-being. Employing a biopsychosocial model and a range of novel and cutting-edge research methods, the project is structured into four work packages designed to isolate causal pathways linking GAHT to psychosocial outcomes, empower transgender individuals to share their personal and relational experiences, and guide policy and practice in gender identity services. The study will adhere to an informed consent model, ensuring the ethical treatment of participants. By focusing on the improvement of psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes, this research seeks to position itself at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare, ultimately contributing to more effective and compassionate care for transgender people."
