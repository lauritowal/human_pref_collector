        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Non-elected Politics: Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\" aims to explore the impact of delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. This crisis is characterized by growing disengagement of citizens from politics, historically low electoral turnout, the rise of anti-establishment and populist parties, and a decline in trust in representative institutions. The central hypothesis posits that non-elected politics does not have a universal effect on support for representative democracy. The research will employ a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and an analysis of how exposure to non-elected politics influences attitudes towards representative democracy. Methodologically, the project will utilize online survey experiments and panel surveys to gather and analyze data. The findings are expected to have far-reaching societal implications, potentially informing institutional reforms aimed at revitalizing democracy."
