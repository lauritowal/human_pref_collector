        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans\" aims to refine the chronology of human evolution and migration in Europe during the Quaternary period, spanning the last 2.6 million years. This period is marked by significant climatic oscillations, expansion of ice sheets, and sea-level changes, which have re-organized plant and animal communities and influenced human evolution and migration. Current dating techniques, particularly radiocarbon dating, are limited to approximately 60,000 years, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of earlier human activities.\n\nTo address this, the project will employ advanced dating methods, including amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating, focusing on calcitic fossils and snail opercula. By applying paired dating methods across a European scale, the project will cover critical regions such as Britain and the Black Sea, and span the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia. The research aims to refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental changes over the last 2.6 million years. Key questions include the timing of early human expansion into Europe, the climatic conditions during this period, and variations in tool technologies. This pan-European chronology will provide a breakthrough in our ability to understand the complex interplay between human evolution and environmental change, offering new insights into the history and prehistory of Europe."
