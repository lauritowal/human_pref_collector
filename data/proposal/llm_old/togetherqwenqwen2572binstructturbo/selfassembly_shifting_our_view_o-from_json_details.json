        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\" seeks to transform our understanding of life by integrating insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and the philosophy of science. Traditionally, life is viewed through the lens of systems that require constant energy input and are tightly regulated by genetic material. However, this project introduces a novel perspective: the concept of self-assembly, where complex patterns and structures emerge spontaneously without external guidance. The primary aims of this endeavor are to develop a new understanding of genetic causation, where genes are seen as 'nudgers' rather than strict determinants, and to construct a robust theoretical framework for explaining self-assembly processes. This framework will not only challenge existing paradigms in the sciences but also provide essential conceptual tools to both the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences. By redefining the role of self-assembly in the emergence and maintenance of life, this project has the potential to fundamentally shift the way we view life, opening new avenues for research and application across multiple disciplines."
