        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Transnational histories of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850),\" or TransCorr, aims to construct a nuanced history of the concept of 'corruption' during a pivotal period of modernity. Focusing on the region of Central-South-East Europe from 1750 to 1850, this research will explore how the perceptions and definitions of corruption, including graft, nepotism, and bribery, were shaped and transformed. It will critically examine how foreign observers and indigenous critics assessed these practices, often motivated by political, professional, or personal interests. TransCorr seeks to demonstrate how certain customs were reframed as corrupt, particularly in the context of claims for more honest and efficient administrations, more effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations. The project will also investigate the impacts of Great Power interventions and the cultural and economic linkages that were established. By tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption, TransCorr aims to contribute to the academic dialogue on global modernization, align historiography with scientific innovations, reframe debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigure our understanding of center-periphery relations. This research promises to offer a deeper insight into the complex dynamics of corruption and its historical evolution in a region that has often been marginalized in broader European narratives."
