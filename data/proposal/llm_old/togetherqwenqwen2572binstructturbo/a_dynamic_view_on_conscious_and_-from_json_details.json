        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\" seeks to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern conscious and unconscious processing in the human mind. By integrating behavioral and brain imaging methods, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these processes interact and influence perception and cognition. Track 1 focuses on unconscious perception, employing Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and stimuli sequences, thereby exploring the extent and complexity of subliminal influences. Track 2 utilizes a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents, offering a detailed analysis of the cognitive mechanisms that lead to perceptual illusions and a deeper understanding of conscious perception. Track 3 investigates the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants, using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG to explore whether the development of consciousness is driven by the maturation of posterior or anterior brain regions. The expected outcomes of this project include evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, a clearer specification of the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and new insights into the development of consciousness in humans, contributing significantly to the fields of cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology."
