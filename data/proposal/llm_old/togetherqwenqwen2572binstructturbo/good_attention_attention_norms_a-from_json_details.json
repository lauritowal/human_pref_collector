        "**Title:** Good Attention: Attention Norms and Their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Good Attention\" (GOODATTENTION) project aims to deliver a comprehensive philosophical investigation of attention norms, offering a novel framework for understanding their emergence, function, and normative implications. By integrating insights from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, ethics, evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, economics, and political theory, this interdisciplinary endeavor seeks to address how attention norms manifest both individually and socially. The project posits that the core norms of attention revolve around relevance, a hypothesis that will be explored through the biological, social, and cognitive functions of relevance processing. Key activities include investigating the biological underpinnings of relevance, the social norms guiding attention, the role of attention in decision-making, its epistemic significance, and the ethical dimensions of attentional duties and rights. Expected outcomes include a significant impact on philosophical discourse and the provision of a robust analytical framework for policy development, thereby enhancing our understanding of attention norms and their multifaceted roles in human cognition and society."
