        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts\" (LostMa) project seeks to advance our understanding of cultural evolution through the lens of medieval manuscript transmission. By focusing on chivalric literature across Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, LostMa aims to uncover the mechanisms by which written artefacts were copied, transformed, or destroyed, and how chance played a role in their preservation or loss. The project will analyze approximately 4,000 documents, with a particular emphasis on about 1,000 Old French manuscripts. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, LostMa combines artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to model the transmission of texts using stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations. Additionally, deep learning techniques will be employed for large-scale data collection. Through these methods, LostMa will contribute to a deeper understanding of how human cultures evolve, the role of human agency in cultural transmission, and the formation of cultural canons. This project promises to shed light on the dynamic processes that have shaped the literary and cultural heritage of medieval Europe."
