        "**Title:** Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, titled \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" seeks to explore the dynamic role of non-human beings in shaping human cultural life through a unique lens. We hypothesize that texts, cinema, and art about the Amazon not only depict the natural world but also highlight how animals and plants actively influence and co-create human cultural narratives. The main challenge is to critically assess how these cultural productions lend a voice to the non-human entities of the Amazon, a region rich in biodiversity and cultural heritage.\n\nTo address this, we introduce the concept of \"zoophytography,\" a term that encapsulates the representation and inscription of animals and plants in cultural media. Our research is structured into three interconnected streams. The first, \"Amazonian Zoophytography,\" aims to formulate a definition of zoophytography and trace its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies, as well as Western philosophy. The second, \"Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out,\" focuses on the articulation of animal voices in cultural productions. The third, \"Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations,\" examines how plants are inscribed in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to the fields of environmental humanities, Amazonian ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. By deepening our understanding of the Amazonian fauna and flora and revealing the interdependence of humans and non-humans, we aim to draw attention to the environmental degradation in the Amazon and uncover more equitable views on the region's animals and plants. Through these efforts, we hope to foster a more holistic and inclusive approach to environmental conservation and cultural representation."
