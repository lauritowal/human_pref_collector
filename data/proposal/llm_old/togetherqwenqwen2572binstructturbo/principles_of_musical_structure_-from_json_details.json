        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\" aims to advance our understanding of human cognition, particularly in the processing of complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music. This interdisciplinary endeavor is structured into three main strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental. The theoretical strand seeks to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that transcends the limitations of current models, which are primarily focused on harmonic syntax and are limited to the expressive power of context-free grammars. By integrating harmonic structure and voice leading constraints, this theory will offer a more comprehensive framework for musical syntax. The computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, implementing the unified syntax theory through generalized parsing and graph grammars. This corpus will serve as a critical resource for training and evaluating the theory's predictive power. The experimental strand will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, structural revision, and tension. This project will significantly contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences by providing a robust theoretical foundation, a rich computational resource, and empirical evidence that can deepen our understanding of how humans perceive and process musical structures."
