        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\" project, proposed under the Horizon 2020 program, aims to construct a novel approach to leveraging social science for the development of more effective social policies. Unlike traditional frameworks that predominantly focus on the production of knowledge, K4U emphasizes the practical application of this knowledge in real-world policy settings. By adopting a Popperian philosophical approach, the project will delve into the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualize the notions of objectivity and deliberation, and explore the role of values at the science-society interface.\n\nKey objectives include the development of a practical understanding that facilitates policy design and deliberation, ensuring a balanced consideration of effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholder interests, and societal acceptability. This initiative seeks to bridge the gap between academic theory and practical policy-making, providing intelligible and actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders. Expected contributions of K4U include the advancement of philosophy for practice and the establishment of the philosophy of social technology as a distinct field. Through these efforts, K4U aims to transform the way social science is utilized in policy-making, fostering more informed, equitable, and effective social policies."
