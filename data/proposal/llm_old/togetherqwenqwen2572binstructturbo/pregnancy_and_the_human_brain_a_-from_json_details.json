        "**Abstract**\n\n\"Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\" is a groundbreaking research initiative aimed at comprehensively mapping the changes in brain anatomy and function that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This project seeks to identify and understand the key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity, with a focus on maternal caregiving, mental health disorders, and memory issues. Utilizing a prospective cohort study design, we will track women from before conception through the postpartum period, employing cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, psychopedagogic measures, and biomedical assessments. Our research aims to pinpoint the neural substrates involved in both adaptive and maladaptive processes associated with pregnancy. By laying the foundation for an emerging field of human neuroscience, this study promises to provide profound insights into the neurobiological journey to motherhood, potentially leading to new interventions and support strategies for maternal health."
