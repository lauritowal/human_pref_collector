        "**Abstract**\n\nThe \"Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\" project seeks to explore the evolution of kinship terminologies and family norms across diverse cultures and historical periods. This multidisciplinary endeavor integrates macro- and micro-evolutionary processes to analyze the universality of kinship change patterns, the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, and the historical processes that shape individual usage patterns. The project comprises three main components: VARIKIN-Evolution, which employs comparative phylogenetic modeling to study the change in kinship terminologies and family norms across eight language families; VARIKIN-Usage, focusing on the practical application of kinship language in spoken and written forms through corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews; and VARIKIN-Development, examining how children in small-scale, non-Western communities acquire and understand kinship concepts using participant observation and elicitation tasks. By linking these components, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of kinship diversity, contributing to broader insights into cultural evolution and the dynamics of family structures."
