        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal, titled \"Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube\" (STRADA), seeks to revolutionize our understanding of ancient transport systems in the Roman Empire by developing a dynamic computer-based simulation system. This interdisciplinary project aims to study the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, focusing on the reconstruction of ancient land and water routes and the experimental determination of transport performance under varying environmental conditions. The simulation will incorporate local topographical details, historical weather data, and the impact of different transport methods, loads, and human factors such as fatigue and rest periods. A modular design approach will ensure the system's sustainability and potential for future expansion. The research area spans Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscapes, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the influence of environmental factors on transport. By integrating technological advancements, experimental data, and historical research, STRADA will offer a new perspective on the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire, contributing to the broader field of historical studies and transport engineering."
