        "**Abstract**\n\nTitle: Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\nThis proposal aims to construct a comprehensive neurocognitive model that elucidates how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Addressing the conceptual and technical challenges inherent in studying social information representation, and acknowledging that traditional experiments often rely on overly simplistic social stimuli, we leverage recent advances in brain signal analysis. Our approach involves studying social interactions in naturalistic settings, focusing on the temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals. Utilizing novel signal analysis methods, advanced experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition, we hypothesize that selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interactions supports interpersonal understanding. Furthermore, we posit that similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with synchronous brain activity, and that intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the brain dynamics underlying social interactions, and may contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. This naturalistic neuroscience approach promises to illuminate the neural mechanisms that facilitate the sharing and transmission of social knowledge, opening new avenues for research and applications in social and cognitive neuroscience."
