        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600,\" seeks to explore the dynamics of state formation in Western Europe during a transformative period. Challenging the conventional top-down narrative of state centralization, this project posits that the decentralization of legal authority played a crucial role in the emergence of early modern states. Through an innovative methodological approach, the study will examine how the interplay between local elites and central authorities influenced the development of fiscal and military resources, often leading to the creation of 'states within states.' Case studies from regions such as Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire will be analyzed to understand the varied paths of state formation, urbanization, and the socio-economic organization of rural societies. The project integrates a path-dependency analytical framework to trace how historical decisions and conditions shaped the trajectory of state development, contributing to a more nuanced social history of power. Additionally, the research will explore ideological dissent and its impact on state formation, while considering the integration of Western European state structures with those of Central and Eastern Europe. This comprehensive study aims to enrich our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of state formation in the late medieval and early modern periods."
