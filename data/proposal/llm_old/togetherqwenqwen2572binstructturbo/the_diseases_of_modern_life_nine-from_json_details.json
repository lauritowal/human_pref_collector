        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"The Diseases of Modern Life: Nineteenth-Century Perspectives\" is a comprehensive research project that delves into the interplay of stress, overload, and modernity-related disorders as depicted in Victorian literature, science, and medicine. Using Benjamin Ward Richardsonâ€™s seminal work, *Diseases of Modern Life* (1876), this project aims to track the circulation of ideas across these disciplines, exploring how physiological, psychological, and social health or disease were interconnected during the nineteenth century. The project focuses on a wide range of issues, including diseases from mental strain, lifestyle diseases such as alcohol and narcotics abuse, environmental pollution, financial speculation, and professional and middle-class health crises. It also examines the role of health-related travel, educational pressures, and the development of phobias and nervous disorders. By adopting a holistic and integrative Victorian vision, this cross-disciplinary scholarship seeks to offer new ways of contextualizing the challenges of modernity, while breaking new ground in the scholarship of psychiatric, environmental, and literary history. The expected outcomes include significant breakthroughs in understanding how these disciplines were compartmentalized and how they influenced each other, providing valuable insights into contemporary health issues."
