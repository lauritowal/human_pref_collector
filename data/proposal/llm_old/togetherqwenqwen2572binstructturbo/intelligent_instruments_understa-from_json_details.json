        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\" project seeks to explore the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on musical creativity and its broader implications for art, culture, and society. This interdisciplinary endeavor aims to develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the evolving relationships between humans and technology, particularly through the lens of music. By integrating diverse scientific disciplines, the project will develop intelligent musical instruments capable of creative collaboration with human artists. These instruments will serve as both artistic and scientific tools, facilitating a deeper understanding of how AI influences our perceptions of self, others, and knowledge. Key objectives include examining the societal impact of creative AI and fostering public discourse on its ethical and social dimensions. The project, led by a team with expertise in music, philosophy, and computer science, will not only advance the technical capabilities of AI in music but also contribute to the broader conversation on human-centered AI design. Through a research collaboration protocol, the project aims to define principles for ethical AI integration into future products and services, ensuring that technological advancements are aligned with societal values."
