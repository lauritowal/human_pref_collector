        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception\" (NUMERIC) project seeks to unravel the fundamental principles underlying conscious perception, focusing on the neuronal mechanisms that determine why certain visual stimuli are consciously perceived while others are not. Building on our labâ€™s previous findings that weak simple stimuli can be consciously reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex, associated with working memory, NUMERIC will explore the neuronal fate of both simple and complex stimuli across multiple brain regions. The visual cortex, acting as a relay station for simple stimuli, and its sustained interaction with associative brain regions for complex stimuli, will be central to this investigation. The project will employ a multi-method approach, including the measurement of single-neuron activity in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and in monkeys, functional imaging, and perturbation methods to construct a comprehensive 'functional connectome'. By characterizing neuronal activity across the cortex and subcortex and identifying the brain regions where activity translates into reportable experiences, NUMERIC aims to provide groundbreaking insights into the neural basis of conscious perception. This research is expected to advance our understanding of how sensory stimuli are transformed into conscious experiences, contributing significantly to the fields of neuroscience and consciousness studies."
