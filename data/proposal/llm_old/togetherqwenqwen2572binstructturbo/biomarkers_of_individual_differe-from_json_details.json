        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\" aims to elucidate how vision is influenced by physiological states and personality traits, addressing a significant gap in our understanding of why normally sighted individuals, including young children, perceive their environment differently. By integrating cutting-edge methodologies such as pupil response analysis, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the human visual cortex, and psychophysical testing, this research seeks to uncover the co-variation between behavioral and cortical properties and personality traits. A novel aspect of this study is the application of physiological interventions, specifically ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, to explore how metabolic changes can alter perceptual styles. The expected outcomes include the identification of new, reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic shifts. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, and inspire new therapeutic approaches that leverage general physiological states. By bridging the gap between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception, this interdisciplinary research promises to contribute significantly to both the scientific community and public health."
