        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE\" (MEGAMAPS) project is a pioneering, transnational study that explores artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, specifically in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, post-2011. Utilizing an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates History, Social Movements Theory, Gender Studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities, MEGAMAPS aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region and write a history from below. The project seeks to investigate the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change, framing and mapping emerging artivism movements. A key outcome will be the creation of an open-access, participative digital platform that documents and systematizes a living corpus of sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, and cartographies. This platform will ensure FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) accessibility to a diverse audience, including academics, stakeholders, and the general public. Through fieldwork and digital ethnography, MEGAMAPS will enhance the participation of activists in transnational networks, promote mutual exchanges of best practices, and contribute to shifting the narrative from victimization to agency for women and sexual minorities, thereby challenging orientalism and islamophobia."
