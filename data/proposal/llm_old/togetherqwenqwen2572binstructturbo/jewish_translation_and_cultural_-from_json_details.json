        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe\" seeks to explore the transformative role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages during the early modern period. This study redefines the process of Jewish modernization as an active importation of new ideas, rather than a stark break from tradition. By examining the dynamic engagement of Jewish translators with their sources, the project uncovers the development of a new, distinctly Jewish corpus that engaged in dialogue with the majority culture. This research aims to provide the first comprehensive analysis of these translations, shedding light on the intercultural exchanges between Christians and Jews at the dawn of modernity. Through this lens, the project proposes a novel paradigm for understanding the early modern 'Jewish book' and the mechanisms of Jewish modernization, contributing to a richer and more nuanced view of cultural transfer and intellectual history in early modern Europe."
