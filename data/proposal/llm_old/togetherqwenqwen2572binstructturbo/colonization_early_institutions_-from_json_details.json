        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project, titled \"Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization,\" aims to explore the foundational elements that contribute to the development of state capacity and the emergence of democratic systems, with a particular focus on the role of political dynasties. This research will utilize the colonial conquest of Latin America by Spain as a unique historical context, specifically examining the initial years of colonization when Spanish conquerors, lacking detailed knowledge of the territories, established early institutions. By analyzing the \"Capitulaciones\" and records from the \"Archivo de Indias,\" this study will delve into the rules governing these early institutions and the strategic location of initial settlements at the subnational level. Methodologically, the research will employ a combination of case studies, panel data analysis, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables to provide a comprehensive understanding of how early colonial decisions shaped long-term political and institutional outcomes. The insights gained from this project will contribute significantly to the broader academic discourse on the origins of state capacity and democratization, offering valuable lessons for contemporary governance and institutional design."
