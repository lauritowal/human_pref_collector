        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\" seeks to redefine the scope and understanding of world literature by focusing on the multilingual and geographically significant contexts of literary production in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia. This initiative critiques the conventional monolingual approach that has dominated modern literary histories, often positioning non-Western literature within a global framework that favors English and other Western languages. By examining the dynamics of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions, the project aims to uncover the rich tapestry of local transculturations and the roles of various actors and technologies in the print and oral dissemination of literature. The study will explore critical periods such as imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment, highlighting the processes of appropriation, co-constitution, and the multiplicity of literary choices and trajectories. The outcome of this research will include a robust theoretical approach, innovative methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues that bridge the gap between academic, cultural, and policy-making spheres. This collaborative effort, involving scholars from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France, will contribute significantly to a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of world literature, challenging the existing biases and expanding the global literary canon."
