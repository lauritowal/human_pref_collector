        "**Abstract**\n\nThe \"Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes\" project seeks to develop a transdisciplinary research program that maps, analyzes, and intervenes in the complex and dynamic nature of contemporary borders. This initiative aims to explore borders not as fixed lines but as porous, shifting, and often solidified spaces that are open for some yet impenetrable for others. Through the use of a digital atlas, the project will employ a topological approach to map the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations, the operation of entities beyond legal frameworks, and the variable enforcement of treaties, as exemplified by the formation of ISIS and the fluctuating border policies in Europe.\n\nThe methodology integrates topological atlas creation, visual counter-geographies, and participative practices, leveraging digital technologies, GIS, and Google Earth to produce maps that represent seamless transitions and the spaces as experienced by migrants and security apparatuses. This project disrupts traditional cartographic norms by adopting a bottom-up perspective, co-producing visual forms of knowledge that adapt to situations of crisis and challenge top-down models of border research.\n\nBy focusing on the research question, \"How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?\", the project seeks to deepen academic inquiry and contribute to the knowledge production that has a tangible impact on the understanding and management of border areas. This proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to advance our understanding of borders as dynamic and experiential spaces."
