        "**Abstract**\n\nThe RESCALE project, titled \"The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives,\" aims to explore the profound transformation in the theoretical practices of physicists, particularly the shift towards scale-based theories since the 1950s. This project seeks to understand how the historical ideal of a final theory has shaped modern physics and its philosophical interpretations, and how this has evolved into a more nuanced, scale-specific approach. Through an integrated historical and philosophical methodology, RESCALE will analyze the epistemological implications of this shift, examining how it affects our understanding of scientific representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics. By conducting a detailed study of the evolution of scale-based theories and their philosophical ramifications, this project aims to provide a comprehensive picture of a world structured in a complex hierarchy of overlapping layers across different scales. This research is crucial for advancing our understanding of the fundamental changes in the scientific landscape and for guiding future philosophical and scientific inquiry."
