        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"The Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Adversity\" initiative aims to construct a comprehensive data infrastructure for life course analyses of the multifaceted impacts of childhood adversity across three generations, involving over 2 million individuals. This project uniquely integrates interdisciplinary methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework to explore the established and transgenerational nature of health inequalities that originate in childhood. By examining the long-lasting and intersecting effects of biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental adversities, the initiative seeks to fill critical gaps in the current literature, which predominantly focuses on social adversity. The data will be used to understand the patterns, mechanisms of generation, and dynamics of change in adversity, as well as to inform the development of a real-world policy data lab. This lab will integrate nationwide policies and simulations to redirect the focus of research and policy towards the multiple layers of adversity and identify targeted support mechanisms for children and families. The outcomes of this project promise to significantly enhance our understanding of how adversity shapes life trajectories and inform more effective, evidence-based interventions to mitigate its impacts."
