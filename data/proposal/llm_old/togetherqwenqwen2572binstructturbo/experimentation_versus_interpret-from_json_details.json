        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\" seeks to challenge and expand the traditional boundaries of music performance by shifting the focus from text-based to performative-based works. Hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, this research will investigate the traditional conception of music bound to historical contexts, aiming to create new pathways through experimental performance practices. By materially engaging in artistic practice and generating new artistic outputs, the project will assess the transferability of scientific experimentation models to the realm of music performance. Expected contributions include significant innovations in both theory and practice, offering new opportunities for scholarship and performance. The practical components of the project encompass theoretical investigation and direct music practice, ultimately aiming to instigate a change in the field of musical performance and provide an alternative to the conventional 'interpretation' approach. This work is situated within the broader discourse of artistic experimentation, pushing the boundaries of what is considered possible in contemporary music performance."
