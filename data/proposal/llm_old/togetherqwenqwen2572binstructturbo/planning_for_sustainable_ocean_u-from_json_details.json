        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change\" (PLAnT) project aims to develop an integrated, sustainable Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) framework for Antarctica, a region currently lacking such a structured approach. Given the high urgency due to rapid environmental changes, PLAnT focuses on incorporating the critical impacts of climate change into its planning. The project's objectives include assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities, building future scenarios, supporting area-based climate action, providing dynamic solutions, conducting governance analyses, and fostering a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity. Recognizing the unique political, social, and economic challenges of the Antarctic context, PLAnT will address the risk of specific solutions by ensuring broad applicability and adaptability. With a strong relevance to the international agenda, this project aims to not only enhance the sustainability of Antarctic marine resources but also inspire global action towards ocean sustainability. By integrating the latest scientific insights and fostering international cooperation, PLAnT seeks to establish a robust foundation for the future of Antarctic marine management."
