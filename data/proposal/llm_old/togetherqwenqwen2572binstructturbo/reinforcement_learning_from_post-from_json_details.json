        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Reinforcement Learning from Post-ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\" aims to investigate the post-ingestive reinforcement mechanisms that underpin food-seeking behavior, with a focus on the dopaminergic substrate and neural activity in brain reward circuits. Utilizing a multi-faceted approach, the study will employ computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation to elucidate how post-ingestive information, particularly energy content, influences food selection and is transmitted via the vagus nerve. The research will be conducted in both rodents and humans, exploring the behavioral and neural correlates in both healthy individuals and those with obesity. Through human probabilistic decision-making tasks, the project seeks to uncover how the brain processes and values caloric intake to guide future food choices. This comprehensive investigation promises to advance our understanding of the physiological and neurological bases of eating behavior, offering potential pathways for intervention in eating disorders and obesity."
