        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) project aims to examine the mechanisms for securing rights and accountability within European prisons, with a focus on how these mechanisms are experienced by prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies. This research is crucial for ensuring fair treatment, upholding rights, and promoting just imprisonment and good order. PRILA will address the overlooked aspects of accountability and rights within the prison context, exploring the power differentials and the expression of public and prison law values. The project will document the experiences of various stakeholders, study the structures for fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making, and analyze appeal and review processes to ensure compliance with human rights principles. By integrating public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, PRILA will employ a mix of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods. The outcomes are expected to transform and extend the understanding of legitimacy in prisons, advance judicial review of administrative actions, and enhance the comprehension of penal power experiences. PRILA will contribute to the development of more effective penal policies and practices, protecting the rule of law and the rights of individuals in the prison system, and offering a distinct European perspective on these critical issues."
