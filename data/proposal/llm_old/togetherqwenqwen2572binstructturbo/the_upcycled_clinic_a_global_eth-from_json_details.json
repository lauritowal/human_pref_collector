        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\" is an innovative ethnographic project aimed at addressing wastefulness in medical settings through a deep dive into repurposing practices. This project, spanning five sub-projects across diverse locations including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., seeks to uncover the conditions that foster creative material engagement in clinical environments. By involving ethnographers alongside cleaners and laundry staff, the initiative employs a multifaceted approach, combining fieldwork, interviews, and the analysis of open datasets. The primary objective is to understand how these creative practices can be nurtured to enhance sustainability and efficiency in healthcare. This study not only moves hospital ethnographies beyond the typical focus on patient encounters but also represents the first globally oriented exploration of improvisation in clinical settings. It aims to develop new methodologies for the reuse and sharing of research materials, thereby advancing theories of materiality and addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. The practical outcomes of this research will articulate the conditions necessary for healthcare creativity, offering local solutions to issues of wastefulness and resource shortages."
