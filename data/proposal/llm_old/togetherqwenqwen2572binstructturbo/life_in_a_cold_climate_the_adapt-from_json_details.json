        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal \"Life in a Cold Climate: The Adaptation of Cereals to New Environments and the Establishment of Agriculture in Europe\" aims to assess the critical role of environmental adaptation in the spread and adoption of agriculture across Europe. By focusing on the ecological pressures faced by key cereal crops—barley and wheat—this project seeks to understand the complex interplay between human activity and environmental changes that facilitated the domestication process. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, including population genomics, ecological modeling, ancient DNA sequencing, and advanced computational methods, the project will identify specific loci in cereal genomes that have undergone selection in response to European conditions. These loci will be correlated with ecogeographical variables to pinpoint the timing and nature of these adaptations. The outcomes will include a comprehensive synthesis of environmental adaptations with archaeological and demographic data, providing a detailed timeline of agricultural spread and its impact on Neolithic populations. This research not only addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the domestication process but also offers insights into the resilience and productivity of early agricultural systems in Europe."
