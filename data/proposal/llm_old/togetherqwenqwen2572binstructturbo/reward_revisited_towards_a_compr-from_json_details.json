        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition,\" seeks to advance our understanding of how reward systems shape cognitive processes. The core aim is to develop a unified conceptual and neural framework that elucidates the mechanisms by which reward influences cognitive operations such as conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. By integrating factors like stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, and the impact of irrelevant information, this project will extend the current conceptual understanding of reward effects. Utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we will investigate the neural activity in dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems, which are crucial for reward processing. This research is significant as it not only provides valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals but also explores disturbances in the DA and NA systems in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, and Parkinson’s disease. The findings will contribute to both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research, potentially leading to new therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric disorders."
