        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Between Canon and Coincidence: using data-driven approaches to understand Art Worlds\" (BECACO) project aims to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections through a large-scale study of the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural materials. Building on Howard Becker's 2008 [1982] concept of \"Art World Patterns,\" BECACO introduces a novel framework that leverages quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining to examine a large corpus of provenance data. Focusing on Indigenous Latin American material from 12 museums across 9 countries in Europe, this project will analyze the period from 1850 to 2000, aiming to develop new models for provenance research and advance both conceptual and methodological understandings. By doing so, BECACO seeks to deepen our understanding of how Indigenous Latin American cultures have been represented and perceived in European contexts, contributing to a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the global art world."
