        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\" aims to create a novel framework for understanding the intricate dynamics of cultural encounters and religious transfers in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. Focusing on Buddhism, this interdisciplinary research will explore how Buddhist doctrines and practices were localized and transformed through interactions among Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan communities. By adopting a trans-regional and trans-cultural approach, the project will reconstruct the Buddhist network that facilitated these exchanges, offering a unique perspective on religious exchange as a dynamic network with both spatial and temporal dimensions. Utilizing methodologies from philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies, the project seeks to integrate Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into the broader field of Comparative Religious Studies, thereby enriching our understanding of the regionâ€™s historical and cultural landscape."
