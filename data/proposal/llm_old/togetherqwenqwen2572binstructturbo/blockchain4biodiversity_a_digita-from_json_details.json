        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\" project aims to enhance global food security and sustainable agriculture by focusing on the conservation and utilization of agrobiodiversity, particularly indigenous seeds (ISK) and associated traditional knowledge. Despite the critical role of ISK in maintaining biodiversity, economic incentives for its cultivation and conservation are dwindling, and current systems fail to track the end use of these seeds, leading to a lack of recognition and compensation for small farmers. This project seeks to develop and test ReSeed, a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate equitable and traceable transfers of ISK and incentivize honest reporting of downstream research. ReSeed will integrate with international regulatory frameworks, requiring minimal legal amendments, and will be governed by ethics guidelines to ensure fair practices. Through a mixed-methods research approach, the project will engage suppliers and buyers of ISK, promoting in situ conservation, research, and innovation in agrobiodiversity. By adding value to farmers' ISK and bringing economic and environmental benefits to small farmers, ReSeed aims to foster a sustainable and equitable agrobiodiversity ecosystem. Building on 12 years of previous research, this initiative seeks to transform the landscape of ISK conservation and utilization, ensuring that the contributions of small farmers are recognized and rewarded."
