        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\" aims to explore the intricate dynamics of land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration, with a specific focus on Mali. Targeting farmers and pastoralists, this research seeks to understand why dispossessed smallholders are more likely to either migrate or engage in violent resistance, often aligning with 'jihadist' groups. Through a mixed-methods approach grounded in political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, the project will investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive these behaviors. Key objectives include assessing the factors that lead to violent resistance versus migration and identifying the role of elite capture in exacerbating land dispossession. The expected outcomes of this research are to provide novel insights into the motivations and agency of smallholders, enhance understanding of the complex interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and offer actionable ideas for policy formulation. This study will contribute significantly to the development of more effective and equitable land governance policies in the region."
