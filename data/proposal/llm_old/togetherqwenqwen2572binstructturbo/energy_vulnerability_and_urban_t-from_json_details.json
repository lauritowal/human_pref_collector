        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\" seeks to address the multifaceted issue of energy poverty in Eastern and Central Europe, affecting millions of households. This project will investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy vulnerability, a concept that extends beyond traditional focuses on income and energy efficiency. By employing a comparative study approach, the research will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to explore case studies in Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. These cities, situated in post-socialist contexts, face significant challenges such as energy price increases, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, and economic and political restructuring, all of which exacerbate energy vulnerability. The project aims to enhance the technical and institutional frameworks to provide more affordable energy services, ultimately contributing to climate change mitigation. This research has the potential to significantly improve the understanding and management of energy poverty, offering practical solutions to a pressing socio-economic issue."
