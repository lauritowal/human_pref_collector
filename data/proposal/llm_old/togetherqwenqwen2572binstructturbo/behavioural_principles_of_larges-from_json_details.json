        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"PRINCIPLES: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation\" aims to address critical global issues such as global warming and the impacts of pandemics like COVID-19 by advancing our understanding of how individuals and groups can act in the collective interest. Current models of cooperation often focus narrowly on specific aspects, limiting their applicability to complex, large-scale challenges. PRINCIPLES seeks to develop a unified science of human cooperation through an integrated, interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are to develop a comprehensive model of human cooperation, experimentally test the behavioral principles that underpin cooperative behavior, investigate the behavioral links between these principles, analyze models of social dilemmas, and explain behavior in large-scale cooperation problems. By employing a novel, experimentally tested framework and conducting incentivized experiments in representative samples, PRINCIPLES will provide researchers and policymakers with robust principles, tools, and data to tackle issues such as climate care more effectively. This project will not only bridge gaps between different social sciences but also equip stakeholders with actionable insights to foster large-scale cooperative efforts."
