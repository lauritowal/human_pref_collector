        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: what do we learn from French firm-level data?\" aims to explore the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, focusing on the roles of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions. It investigates the phenomenon of creative destruction and its implications for economic dynamics. The research addresses four critical questions: (a) the measurement of productivity growth and the factors contributing to TFP growth due to new innovations; (b) the causal relationship between international trade and innovation, particularly the impact of exports and imports on innovation processes; (c) the influence of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, with a specific focus on how French legislation changes affect self-employment incentives; and (d) the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and well-being, including its impact on social mobility and health. By integrating theoretical insights with empirical data, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and policies that foster innovation and growth, and their broader implications for addressing challenges such as the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, and top income inequality. The findings will contribute to the design of more effective growth policies that promote sustainable economic development and social progress."
