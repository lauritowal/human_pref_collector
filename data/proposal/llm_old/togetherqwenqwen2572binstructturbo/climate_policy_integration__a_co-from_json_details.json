        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\" aims to develop a novel theory explaining the persistent lack of coordination in growing policy regimes, particularly focusing on climate policy integration. Given the EU's projected failure to meet its 2050 net-zero target, this research fills a critical gap by addressing the lack of a system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies in policy processes. The project employs a multi-faceted methodology, combining quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, and comparative case studies to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration and understand their temporal dynamics. By analyzing the EU and selected member states, the research seeks to identify system-level solutions and simulate policy reforms that can enhance coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. Expected outcomes include actionable insights and recommendations to improve climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the debate on policy integration beyond the climate domain. This project leverages the researcher’s expertise in analyzing actor constellations within policy processes to deliver a comprehensive and impactful contribution to the field."
