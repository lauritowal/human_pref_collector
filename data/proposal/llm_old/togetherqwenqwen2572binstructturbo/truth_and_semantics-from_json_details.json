        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Truth and Semantics\" project aims to explore the intersection of truth-conditional semantics and theories of self-applicable truth, addressing critical challenges in the field of natural language semantics. This initiative seeks to develop robust semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, focusing on key elements such as the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. By adopting a metasemantic perspective, the project will also investigate the foundational role of truth in the structure of natural language semantics. The anticipated outcome is a pioneering, systematic study that integrates these perspectives, offering new insights into the nature of truth and its implications for the semantics of natural language. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how meaning is constructed and conveyed in complex linguistic contexts."
