        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Forced Migration and Development\" aims to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration, a crisis affecting over 68.5 million displaced individuals, with 85% hosted by developing countries. This proposal, encapsulated under the project FORCEDMIGDEV, is structured into two main components. The first component focuses on refugee inflows, specifically investigating the Syrian refugee crisis in Turkey. Activities include developing and estimating a structural model to address critical questions on the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks across different regions and the impacts of legal status on refugees. The second component examines the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement, integrating reduced-form and structural methods. This part includes estimating the reduced-form effects of climate-induced displacement in Brazil and developing a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-term economic impacts. The project intersects with climate and development economics, aiming to provide actionable insights for policymakers to better manage and mitigate the economic and social challenges associated with forced migration."
