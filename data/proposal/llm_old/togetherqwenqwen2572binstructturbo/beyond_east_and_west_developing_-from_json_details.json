        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\" aims to bridge the gap between Turkeyâ€™s rich musical heritage and contemporary concert music, fostering a transcultural dialogue that enriches both Eastern and Western musical traditions. Based in Turkey, this initiative seeks to integrate Turkish musical elements into modern compositions through a series of research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK. The project will train traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers in new repertoire, while also teaching Western musicians non-Western vocal techniques. A key focus is the development of an ensemble interface that facilitates the use of newly designed instruments, alongside comprehensive studies on timbre and the mapping of Eastern and Western tuning systems. Outputs include an e-book titled \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds, and a collection of online audio and visual examples, all published by Cambridge University Press. This project not only enhances the cultural and technical skills of participating musicians but also establishes a model for transcultural musical practice that can help overcome cultural barriers and promote mutual understanding."
