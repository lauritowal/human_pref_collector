        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators\" seeks to address the burgeoning complexity in the landscape of Country Performance Indicators (CPIs) across critical policy fields such as education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. While individually CPIs serve to simplify and clarify, their collective abundance paradoxically complicates the policy-making process. This proposal aims to fill a significant research gap by investigating how both users and producers of CPIs adapt over time in response to the increasing multiplicity of indicators. Drawing inspiration from the concept of a \"marketplace of ideas,\" the study will employ a systemic, longitudinal analysis to explore how users learn from criticism and integrate diverse CPIs into their decision-making processes, and how producers navigate and compete within crowded policy fields. By advancing a systematic understanding of these dynamics, the project aims to shift the focus of CPI research towards a more strategic and adaptive approach, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness and utility of CPIs in guiding policy and practice."
