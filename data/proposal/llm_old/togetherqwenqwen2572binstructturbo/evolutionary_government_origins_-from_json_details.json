        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government\" project, under the study name \"STATE-DNA,\" seeks to explore the dynamic nature of government structures through an evolutionary lens. This research aims to address critical questions regarding the reasons behind structural changes in government and the subsequent impact on policy. The hypotheses suggest that these changes are a result of the interaction between the structural features of governmental units and their organizational and environmental contexts, leading to evolutionary consequences in policy formulation and implementation.\n\nThe study will employ a unique dataset, spanning from 1815 to 2025, encompassing approximately 150,000 units across six countries. Utilizing innovative methodologies such as genetic measures for assessing structural change and data assimilation techniques from biology, the project aims to create a comprehensive dataset of government structures since the early 19th century. This will facilitate a systematic analysis of the effects of structural changes on government policy and enable predictive forecasting of future structural modifications.\n\nExpected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving structural change, the identification of patterns in policy evolution, and the development of a robust predictive model. These findings will contribute significantly to the fields of political science and public administration, offering insights that can inform governance practices and public policy development."
