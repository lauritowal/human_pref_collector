        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\" seeks to reassess the early history of European political economy by shifting the focus from theoretical constructs to practical applications. By examining eighteenth-century political economy through the lens of measures and policies aimed at betterment and improvement, rather than through the prism of modern methods and models, this study challenges conventional narratives. Centering on the Swedish Empire as a primary case study, with comparative insights from other regions, the project explores how ideas of improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare were articulated and implemented. Key discursive sites, including the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, are analyzed to uncover the ways in which activities in these arenas were directed towards enhancing state and societal organization and improving living conditions. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches our understanding of the historical development of political economy but also offers valuable insights applicable to contemporary discussions on economic policy and social welfare."
