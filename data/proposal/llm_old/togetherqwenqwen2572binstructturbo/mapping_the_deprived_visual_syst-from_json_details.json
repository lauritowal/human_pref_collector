        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction\" (MADVIS) project aims to elucidate the impact of visual deprivation at various developmental stages on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. By integrating cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, this study will explore the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and the potential for sight recovery. The primary objectives are to uncover how the brain's visual processing regions adapt in the absence of visual input and to use this knowledge to develop predictive models for the outcomes of sight restoration procedures. MADVIS seeks to advance the understanding of experience-dependent brain development, bridge the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sensory restoration, and contribute to the development of new tools that can enhance the effectiveness of visual rehabilitation techniques."
