        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\" (CCLAD) project delves into the emergence and contestation of justice norms within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This interdisciplinary research, situated in the realm of International Relations, aims to address the urgent need to tackle the consequences of climate change, particularly in areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration. Despite the increasing awareness of these issues, there remains a significant lack of consensus on effective loss and damage policies at both international and national governance levels. CCLAD employs a unique combination of theoretical and ethnographic methodologies to explore the conditions under which norm hegemony is achieved, contested, or reversed. By examining the micro-politics of international negotiations and conducting comparative research on domestic policy practices, the project seeks to advance a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. This study posits that norms are partly constituted through the processes of policy-making and implementation, thus contributing methodologically to political ethnography and developing innovative practice-tracing methods. CCLAD's findings will provide crucial insights into how international and national policies can better address the complex challenges posed by climate change, fostering a more equitable and resilient global response."
