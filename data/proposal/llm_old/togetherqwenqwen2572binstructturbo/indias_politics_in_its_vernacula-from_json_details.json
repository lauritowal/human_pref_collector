        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\" seeks to explore the conceptual foundations of India's political life, a critical gap in understanding the world’s largest democracy and a rising global power. This project will delve into the ideas guiding ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement through an innovative, interdisciplinary approach combining ethnographic and historical scrutiny of India’s vernacular languages. Collaborating with anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics, the research aims to lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life. A key output will be the development of an online, open-access Concept Laboratory, serving as a dynamic resource for scholars and the public. Additionally, the project will facilitate a dialogue on the implications for global political theory, engaging European political ideas scholars. Inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, this study promises to advance the study of subcontinental politics, provide methodological insights beyond Europe, and contribute to the analytical framework of global political theory. Through this comprehensive exploration, the project will illuminate the rich tapestry of India's political discourse and its significance in a global context."
