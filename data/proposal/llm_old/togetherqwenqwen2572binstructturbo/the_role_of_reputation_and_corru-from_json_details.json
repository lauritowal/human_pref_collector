        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal, titled \"The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement,\" aims to enhance the integrity and efficiency of procurement processes across critical sectors such as defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The project is structured into three empirical components, each addressing specific challenges and opportunities within the procurement landscape.\n\nThe first component explores the use of reputation in contract procurement, particularly focusing on the impact of vendor rating systems. It seeks to understand how these systems influence contractor performance, procurement costs, and the levels of corruption, while also assessing their role in facilitating the entry of new bidders into the market.\n\nThe second component delves into the issue of corruption in public procurement, analyzing the extent of criminal networks and the effectiveness of current awarding rules in mitigating corrupt practices. This part will also develop and test methods for detecting corruption, contributing to the broader goal of preventing it.\n\nFinally, the third component examines healthcare procurement regulations, with a particular emphasis on EU practices. It will conduct a descriptive analysis of these practices and evaluate the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, ultimately assessing the outcomes in terms of patient welfare.\n\nTogether, these components aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations to avoid waste, enhance social welfare, prevent corruption, and ensure contractor compliance, thereby contributing significantly to the field of procurement and public sector management."
