        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe purpose of this grant proposal, titled \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" is to investigate the intricate relationships between menâ€™s evolving roles in family and work and their health and cognitive function. Despite significant strides towards gender equality, men continue to suffer from higher rates of premature mortality and preventable excess mortality, underscoring a critical need to address these disparities. This project aims to enhance men's health and cognitive outcomes, thereby contributing to their increasing family roles, enhanced labor market participation, and broader societal potential.\n\nThe study will focus on young adulthood and midlife, critical periods for the development of health and cognitive trajectories. It will explore various aspects including cohort and period differences, the work-life interface, the impact of the male breadwinner model, and the increasing participation of fathers in childcare. Utilizing a robust methodology that disentangles selection and causality, the research will draw on comprehensive Norwegian population data, including register, survey, and genetic data. Health measures will encompass self-reported, clinical, and register-based assessments, while employment data will cover work participation and occupation specifics. The cognitive trajectories will be analyzed from a sample size of over 12,000 men, spanning from late teens to the age range of 36-69.\n\nThis research is poised to provide actionable insights into the multifaceted challenges men face in contemporary society, offering a foundation for policy and intervention strategies aimed at improving men's health and cognitive well-being."
