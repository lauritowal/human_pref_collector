        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Global Economies of Salvation. Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\" (GLOBECOSAL) project delves into the role of artworks in the negotiation of sanctity within Catholic communities during the post-Tridentine era. This research focuses on the global context of the time, particularly the interactions between the Roman Curia and the Iberian empires, where the Catholic Church faced significant challenges from Protestantism. By examining the production and circulation of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, this study aims to uncover how these pieces were instrumental in the formation of social identities and the affirmation of societies as producers of saints. The project will employ a methodology that traces the movement of material objects, iconographies, and global networks of knowledge transmission, set within the theoretical framework of a global market of symbolic values. Incorporating critical sociology, GLOBECOSAL seeks to globalize the history of early modern art, challenge existing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, and provide a nuanced understanding of colonialism and the early modern world. This exploration of neglected areas, such as local constructions of sanctity, will enrich our understanding of how art facilitated the negotiation of spiritual status in a complex, interconnected world."
