        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project, titled \"The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation,\" aims to explore the influence of the international right to housing on national legal systems, specifically focusing on eviction litigation cases. This study is particularly pertinent in the context of the 2007-2011 financial crisis, which led to the displacement of approximately 700,000 people in Europe. By employing data science techniques, including citation network analysis and machine learning, this project seeks to analyze extensive legal big data from national supreme courts and lower-level courts. The primary objectives are to identify predictors of court decisions, perform empirical analysis, and conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights. This data-driven approach not only enhances our understanding of the interaction between national and international law but also provides a framework that can be applied to future research in other areas of the law. The outcomes of this study are expected to reveal significant predictors of court decisions, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on the right to housing and its practical implications in legal practice."
