        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps\" project, or LostInZoom, seeks to revolutionize the way multi-scale maps are used in crisis management by addressing the common issue of user disorientation during zooming interactions. This project aims to identify and leverage multi-scale visual landmarks as cognitive anchors, which can guide users effectively through different map scales. By conducting cognitive experiments, we will explore how these landmarks can be recognized and utilized to enhance user navigation. Building on this, we will design innovative cartographic generalization techniques and new zooming interactions that prioritize these landmarks. This approach is crucial given the widespread use of multi-scale maps in both professional and daily settings, where current design guidelines fall short in providing a seamless user experience. The outcomes of this research will provide map designers with essential tools and guidelines to create more intuitive and user-friendly multi-scale maps, thereby improving decision-making processes in critical crisis management scenarios."
