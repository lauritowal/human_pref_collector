        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"How Citizens Try to Influence Politics and Why: International Comparisons of Movement and Party Politics\" aims to explore and understand the dynamics of political participation and apathy across diverse democratic societies. By employing a comprehensive and integrated approach, the project will examine contentious and non-contentious political behaviors in eight countries: The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina. The research is structured into four interconnected subprojects: a meta-analysis of existing literature on movement and party politics, a comparative analysis of global survey data to track political participation trends over time and across countries, focus group discussions to delve into the personal and contextual factors that influence political engagement or disengagement, and experimental surveys with 1,000 respondents to measure and understand the specific patterns of political participation. This multifaceted investigation seeks to uncover the underlying causes of different modes of political participation and the interplay between individual, organizational, and societal factors. The outcomes will provide critical insights into the mechanisms that drive political engagement, contributing to a deeper understanding of democratic processes and the role of citizens in shaping political outcomes."
