        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\" aims to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia and interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through hundreds of monuments across Europe. Initially, the project will focus on documentation and surveying these sites, laying the groundwork for long-term research that seeks to provide new insights, facilitate comparative studies, and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of these re-creations. Key areas of study include the examination of these sites as icons, maps, and nodes within a broader network, as well as their roles as interactive multimedia, spaces, and places. The project will contribute to our understanding of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. Research activities will encompass field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and the grouping of monuments to identify and crystallize clusters. Collaboration will be fostered through discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, ensuring a multidisciplinary approach. Outputs will be produced throughout the research stages, culminating in a comprehensive book at the project's conclusion. This initiative promises to enrich our knowledge of the cultural and spiritual connections between Europe and Jerusalem, highlighting the enduring impact of these re-creations on European heritage and identity."
