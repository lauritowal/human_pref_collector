        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers’ Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe,\" addresses the pressing issues of low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages in the teaching profession. By adopting a systematic comparative approach, the project focuses on the educational systems of Belgium, France, and England. The main objectives are to explain the nature of teacher policy, understand the status change of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration. Employing a post-comparative mixed-method design, the project encompasses four work packages: teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. Methodologies include policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, multilevel multi-group analyses, and semi-structured interviews. Data will be drawn from national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility, focusing on non-entrants and early leavers. The expected outputs include new theoretical knowledge and a reconceptualization of institutional change, contributing to a deeper understanding of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the profession in Europe."
