        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\" aims to address significant limitations in current building information modeling (BIM) technologies. Existing BIM systems inadequately represent buildings, focusing predominantly on physical and material characteristics while neglecting the context, intended use, and user considerations. This narrow focus limits the evaluation of buildings to physical aspects such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, thereby failing to predict the building's impact on future users' lives and activities or assess whether the building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nThis research seeks to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that integrates form, function, and use information into BIM systems. By incorporating user behavior and context, the proposed system will enhance the ability to design buildings that not only meet functional and structural requirements but also support and enhance human activities and interactions within the built environment. The broader context of this research acknowledges the profound impact of the built environment on life on Earth, emphasizing the need for buildings that are not only sustainable and efficient but also conducive to the well-being and productivity of their users. The successful development of this advanced BIM system will lead to better-designed buildings that are more responsive to human needs and behaviors, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and livable built environment."
