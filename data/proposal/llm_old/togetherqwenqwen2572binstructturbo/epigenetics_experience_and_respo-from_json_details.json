        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Impigenetics for Neurodevelopmental Disorders\" (NEUROEPIGENETHICS) seeks to explore the ethical implications of epigenetics in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This interdisciplinary endeavor integrates theoretical and empirical methods to examine how social and physical environments influence the development and manifestation of these conditions. By challenging traditional dichotomies such as innate vs. acquired, genetic vs. environmental, and biological vs. psychosocial, NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to redefine concepts of capacity and normative responsibility. The project will engage directly with persons affected by NDDs and their families, ensuring that the ethical discourse is grounded in the lived experiences of stakeholders. Through this comprehensive approach, NEUROEPIGENETHICS seeks to enhance understanding and inform policies that support more equitable and responsible practices in the treatment and support of individuals with NDDs."
