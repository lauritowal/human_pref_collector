        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"NUCLEARWATERS: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History\" proposes a novel approach to understanding nuclear energy by framing it as a history of water. This project posits that nuclear energy is fundamentally a hydraulic technology, rooted in centuries of hydraulic engineering and the development of hydraulic civilizations. Through six work packages, NUCLEARWATERS will investigate the historical convergence of water-manipulating technologies with nuclear energy, exploring how conceptions of wet and dry risks have shaped the development and perception of nuclear power. The project will delve into specific themes, including the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the nuclear waters of the Soviet Union, the nuclearized Rhine Valley, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the nuclear influences on the Baltic Sea region. By revising the historical narrative of nuclear energy from a water-centric perspective, NUCLEARWATERS aims to resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history, contributing to the fields of the history of technology and environmental history. Additionally, the project seeks to inform and enrich public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond, offering a fresh, interdisciplinary perspective that highlights the critical role of water in the nuclear age."
