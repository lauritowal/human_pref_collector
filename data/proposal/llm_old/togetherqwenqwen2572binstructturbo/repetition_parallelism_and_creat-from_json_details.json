        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Repetition, Parallelism and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\" (REPAC) project aims to explore the intricate relationship between textual form and function in the literary, magical, and mantic genres of first millennium BCE Ancient Mesopotamia. By examining clay tablets inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform, this study focuses on textual features such as exact and variant repetition, parallelism, refrains, and ring composition. These elements are crucial not only for their poetic creativity and rhetorical effectiveness but also for their role in enhancing argumentation and inventiveness. The project seeks to uncover how these textual strategies were used for aesthetic ornamentation, analogical reasoning, argument construction, and even magical action, reflecting the scribes' worldview of interconnectedness, causal effectiveness, and similarity. Addressing a significant gap in our understanding of the Mesopotamian literary and scholarly methods, REPAC aims to provide a deeper insight into the creative processes and intellectual underpinnings of this ancient civilization."
