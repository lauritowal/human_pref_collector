        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the Public Good in Africa\" is an anthropological study focused on the implementation and interpretation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries. UHC, a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals, aims to ensure that all people can access necessary health services without suffering financial hardship. However, its pursuit in Africa is complicated by historical issues such as structural-adjustment policies, reduced state capacity, privatization, and the neglect of national health-care systems, which have led to a burden of payment on the poor and a lack of trust in government services.\n\nThis project will examine the characteristics of UHC as a state responsibility and public good, addressing the challenges of its partial pursuit by African states, conflicting interests, and the contested nature of the field. Through a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, the research will explore the roles and interactions of actors and institutions at the global, national, and local levels. It will also investigate the relationships between states and citizens, formal systems of social protection, and informal social networks that support health, all within the context of national histories and social practices.\n\nBy providing a nuanced understanding of how UHC is realized in diverse African contexts, the project aims to contribute new research directions and generate knowledge with relevance beyond the region, ultimately enhancing the global discourse on health policy and social protection."
