        "**Abstract**\n\nThe POLYCHROME project, titled \"The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics,\" aims to investigate the status, volatility, and repair history of approximately 150 painted and gilded Christian images, wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. This project seeks to challenge the current assumptions that damages to these artifacts are due to accidents or unspecific vandalism by exploring the hypothesis that many damages can be linked to iconoclastic acts. Historical events such as Sweden's break with the church in Rome in 1527 under Gustav I and Denmark-Norway's similar action in 1537 under Christian III have significantly impacted these heritage objects, transforming them from objects of devotion to cultural heritage. The project will employ advanced technologies from the natural sciences to overcome challenges posed by a lack of archival evidence and secondary paints that may mask original information. Key objectives include creating an analytical overview of the selected objects, collecting material data, mapping restorations and repairs, and laying the groundwork for future multidisciplinary studies. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how Lutheranism influenced the preservation of these artifacts and the potential to influence training priorities in heritage conservation. This research will contribute to a broader debate about the values and future care of Nordic cultural heritage."
