        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture\" explores the underexamined engagement of Ireland with ancient Greek and Roman cultures, despite Ireland not being part of the Roman Empire. This research posits that Ireland has a rich tradition of classical learning, evident in its earliest recorded literature, which has shaped its cultural identity uniquely. The proposal focuses on nine thematic areas—language, land, travel and exile, the myth of Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence—using a multi-thematic approach and a heuristic framework to foster dialogue between diverse academic fields. This interdisciplinary dialogue includes classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English and Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project also addresses contemporary Irish concerns, such as the politics and history of Ireland, the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state (1912-1922), and the ongoing issues of violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. The expected impact of this research includes opening new avenues for investigation and a deeper understanding of the influence of classical culture on literary, social, and political discourses in Ireland, extending beyond the past 100 years."
