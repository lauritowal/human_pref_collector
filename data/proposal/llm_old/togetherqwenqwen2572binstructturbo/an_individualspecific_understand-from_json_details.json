        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\" (SynSig) project seeks to delve into the nuanced relationship between interpersonal synchrony and mental health, moving beyond the one-size-fits-all assumption that higher synchrony universally yields better outcomes. Our primary objectives are to investigate the unique synchrony signatures of individuals, explore methods for tailoring corrections to these signatures, and analyze how these adjustments can transform relationships into curative environments. To achieve these goals, SynSig will employ a multimodal approach, integrating motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals in both human and virtual human dyadic interactions. A key innovation is the development of the first multimodal feedback system capable of detecting momentary deviations from an individual's synchrony signature, facilitating real-time, personalized adjustments. Through rigorous study, we aim to provide robust evidence for the existence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, deepen our understanding of the multi-layered nature of synchrony, and uncover the intricate connections between human interactions and mental health. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly advance personalized mental health interventions and therapeutic practices."
