        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\" aims to explore the social and cultural transformations in late Ottoman Palestine, a critical region in the Eastern Mediterranean. This study focuses on the period from 1880 to 1920, a time marked by intense European imperialism, Ottoman state-building, and global economic integration. By examining the social strategies employed by Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class divides to cope with these challenges, the project seeks to uncover the mechanisms of social differentiation and human mobility. Utilizing census data and comparative analysis of social practices, the research hypothesizes that the accumulation of individual actions led to the continuous emergence and re-emergence of social formations. The project's objectives include contributing to the global social and cultural history of the region, developing a theoretical framework for understanding colonialism and state-building, establishing methodological standards, and creating a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a nuanced understanding of how late Ottoman Palestinians navigated a period of significant change and uncertainty, offering insights applicable to similar contexts worldwide."
