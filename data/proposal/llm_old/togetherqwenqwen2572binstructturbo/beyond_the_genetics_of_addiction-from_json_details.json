        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Beyond the Genetics of Addiction\" project aims to unravel the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors contributing to the use and addiction of substances such as nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and caffeine. Utilizing an extended twin family design, this study will integrate DNA-variant data, RNA data, and biomarkers analysis to identify and confirm specific genes and gene networks associated with substance use. By exploring gene expression patterns and investigating biomarkers, we seek to deepen our understanding of how these factors influence health outcomes. Drawing from the extensive longitudinal phenotype database and biological samples of the Netherlands Twin Register, our large sample size will provide robust data essential for meaningful analysis. Our team, with over two decades of experience in data collection, coordination, analysis, behavior genetics, and addiction research, is well-equipped to conduct this comprehensive study. We plan to employ state-of-the-art analysis methods to ensure the reliability and validity of our findings. This project not only seeks to advance the scientific understanding of addiction but also to inform the development of targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing substance use and its associated health risks."
