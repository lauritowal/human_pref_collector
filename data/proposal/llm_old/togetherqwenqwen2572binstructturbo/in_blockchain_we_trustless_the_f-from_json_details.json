        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\" (BlockchainGov) aims to explore the transformative impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, spanning community to global levels. This multidisciplinary endeavor, integrating computer science, political science, and law, seeks to investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, analyze the power dynamics within these systems, and examine the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance models. Additionally, the project will delve into the potential of blockchain to support new models of decentralized decision-making, experimenting with these models across various governance levels. By opening a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, BlockchainGov aims to provide significant empirical and theoretical contributions to science, while also offering valuable policyimations for global governance. To achieve these ambitious goals, the project requires a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team, and a blend of multidisciplinary skills."
