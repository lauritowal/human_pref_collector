        "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\", aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of technological shifts on corporate governance, environmental and social (ES) responsibility, and employee compensation. The first pillar investigates the communication dynamics between corporations and shareholders, particularly the effects of transitioning to virtual-only shareholder meetings. Initial findings suggest that this shift has disproportionately minimized shareholder voices, allowing companies to strategically sidestep critical questions. The second pillar employs natural language processing to dissect the discrepancy between firms' stated and actual ES actions. Preliminary results indicate that markets reward companies for merely declaring ES goals rather than implementing substantive changes. Finally, the third pillar focuses on the tech industry to analyze the relationship between employee characteristics, especially gender, and their eligibility for and ability to maximize employee benefits and compensation (EBC). This research aims to uncover how these technological and corporate policies impact the broader economic landscape and individual welfare, providing actionable insights for policymakers, investors, and corporate leaders."
