        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe During MIS3\" seeks to explore the impact of climatic changes on the behavioral flexibility and resilience of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. Focusing on key locations in the Southern European peninsulas, this study will analyze 20 archaeological sites using advanced methodologies such as zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope analyses. The primary objectives are to assess the subsistence strategies of both species, reconstruct local climatic and environmental conditions, and develop a novel procedure to estimate the ecosystem's carrying capacity. By understanding the adaptive behaviors and resilience of these prehistoric populations, the project aims to elucidate the subsistence patterns that favored AMH and the climatic factors that contributed to Neanderthal extinction. This research holds significant relevance for prehistory studies on a pan-European scale, offering insights into human-environment interactions during a critical period of human evolution."
