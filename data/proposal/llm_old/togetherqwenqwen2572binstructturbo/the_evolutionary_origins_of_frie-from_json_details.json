        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach\" seeks to explore the fundamental aspects of friendship from an evolutionary standpoint, a critical component in understanding human health, well-being, and public health. This research aims to address the significant risks associated with social isolation, such as heart disease, by comparing the social bonds of humans with those of nonhuman primates, particularly macaques. The study will test environmental forces that drive variations in social bonds across species, assess whether the ability to understand friendships among unrelated individuals is unique to humans, and investigate if social isolation results from competitive exclusion. Utilizing a comprehensive cross-species dataset and innovative social experiments, this project will provide valuable insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying human social behavior, contributing to both theoretical knowledge and practical implications for mitigating social isolation and related health issues. By elucidating the evolutionary origins of friendship, this research will enhance our understanding of human specializations and inform political policies aimed at fostering healthier, more connected communities."
