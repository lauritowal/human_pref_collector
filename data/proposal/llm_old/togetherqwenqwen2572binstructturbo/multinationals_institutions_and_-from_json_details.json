        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe\" aims to investigate the strategic location decisions of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their territorial impacts, particularly in the European context. MNEs, which contribute over US$16 trillion in value-added and account for more than a quarter of the world GDP, play a crucial role in global economic dynamics. This study will address significant gaps in the current literature by exploring how institutional frameworks and innovation ecosystems influence the location choices of MNEs, and how these choices, in turn, affect economic development, innovation, and policy-making. The research will also analyze the substantial increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows from developing economies, which rose from 16% of global outflows in 2007 to 31% in 2012, reaching $426 billion. By providing a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics, the project will offer valuable insights and tools for policymakers to enhance the strategic positioning of European regions and institutions in the global economy."
