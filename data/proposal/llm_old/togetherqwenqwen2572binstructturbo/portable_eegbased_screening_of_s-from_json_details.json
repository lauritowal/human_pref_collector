        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal outlines the development of \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns,\" a groundbreaking project aimed at designing a portable, wireless EEG device tailored for newborns. The primary goals are to enable rapid and automatic testing of face processing capabilities, which are critical for early social development, and to identify an early, objective EEG-based biomarker for newborns at risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Key features of the device include an EEG-based index of face processing, requiring less than two minutes of the newbornâ€™s visual attention, with an innovative oscillatory visual presentation and dry electrodes to ensure comfort and ease of use. The system is designed with a low-power, wireless EEG device and an automatic online extraction algorithm to facilitate seamless data collection and analysis. This project addresses a significant market gap, as no fully portable EEG system currently exists for newborns. The potential benefits include the identification of ASD biomarkers, facilitating early behavioral interventions, and the development of large-scale screening protocols. Additionally, the device has applications in home testing and research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns. By merging an innovative experimental paradigm with advanced portable EEG technology, this project aims to revolutionize the early assessment of social processing abilities in newborns, paving the way for more effective and timely interventions."
