        "**Abstract:**\n\n\"The Everyday Politics of Famine\" is a crucial research initiative aimed at understanding the persistent and escalating threat of famines. In 2022 alone, 250,000 people experienced famine, while 35 million were on the brink. This project focuses on the everyday politics of famine within affected communities, specifically in South Sudan and Somalia. Our research seeks to uncover the underlying reasons for the persistence of famines, challenge the current scientific understanding of famine politics, and explore the normalization of new, deadly famines. We will also investigate how blame for famine-related suffering is displaced, often obscuring the true causes and exacerbating the crisis. Utilizing an ethnographically-informed comparative study, we will delve into several research strands, including the histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives that reinforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. Led by a team with extensive experience, strong networks, and a track record of building capacity, this project promises to provide critical insights and inform more effective strategies to combat famine."
