        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\" aims to promote work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe by examining the role of trade unions in the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections. This research is crucial for advancing social policies that support sustainable work through family and self-care time. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses, to explore the dynamics of care leave policies in rich democracies since 1965. Qualitative case studies in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms through which trade unions influence policy-making in different institutional settings. The project focuses on various forms of care leave, including child care, aging parent care, spousal care, sick leave, and disability benefits. It addresses the gendered aspects of caregiving, recognizing womenâ€™s predominance in both caregiving roles and union membership. By advancing comparative labour studies and developing theories of union-policy relationships, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of organized labour's role in shaping sustainable work policies. The development of a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers."
