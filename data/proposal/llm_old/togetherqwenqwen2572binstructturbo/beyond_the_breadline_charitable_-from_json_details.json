        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision (CFP) and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\" aims to explore the dynamics of CFP in the context of urban poverty and food insecurity, particularly in the aftermath of the Great Recession. By focusing on Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, and specifically the cities of Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, this research seeks to chart the historical trajectory of CFP, examining how it functions within different welfare and civil society regimes. The study will address significant research gaps, including the lack of a robust framework for comparing CFP across countries and the need to contextualize CFP within broader transitions towards sustainable food use and waste reduction. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including event sequence analysis, social network analysis, and urban ethnography, the project will investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support mechanisms, and the roles of professionalized CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings. An innovative real-time data collection tool will be introduced in city workshops to enhance the accuracy and immediacy of data. The anticipated impact includes the creation of new knowledge and a comparative framework that extends the understanding of CFP and food support systems, potentially influencing policy and practice in multiple countries and cities."
