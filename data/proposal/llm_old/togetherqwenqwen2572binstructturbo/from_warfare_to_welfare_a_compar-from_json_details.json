        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"From Warfare to Welfare: A Comparative Study of How Combat Trauma is Internalized and Institutionalized\" seeks to explore the multifaceted dimensions of combat trauma across Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. By integrating methodologies such as ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, this interdisciplinary study aims to develop a robust comparative framework that elucidates how combat trauma is shaped and managed within military and psychiatric institutions. The research will delve into the institutionalization of combat trauma, examining the conflicting values and perceptions of ethnicity that influence its treatment and understanding. Targeting veterans and clinicians, the project aims to identify key issues in veteran care, with the goal of impacting policy and healthcare practices. Additionally, the study seeks to advance academic discussions in biopolitics and medicalization by providing a deeper understanding of the internalization of war-related suffering. Through this comprehensive approach, the project aspires to contribute meaningful insights that can enhance the support and welfare of veterans and inform broader societal discussions on the long-term impacts of warfare."
