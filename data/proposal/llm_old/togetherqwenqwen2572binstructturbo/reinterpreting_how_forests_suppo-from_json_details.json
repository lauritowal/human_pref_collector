        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\" aims to address the critical issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting over 2 billion individuals. While current strategies focus primarily on increasing agricultural production and access to calories, a significant blind spot remains: the vital role of forests in dietary diversification. Forests provide essential wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which in turn supply meat, milk, eggs, and manure, enhancing dietary quality and nutritional intake.\n\nThis multi-scale, multi-country, data-rich project will identify the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages, and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality. By integrating broad-scale perspectives on forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes with hotspot identification linking household food consumption data to forest metrics, and in-depth fieldwork in two selected locations, the project will elucidate the causal relationships between forests and dietary outcomes. The ultimate goal is to shift the conceptualization of food security by recognizing the critical role of forests in supporting dietary diversity and nutritional health in low-income communities."
