        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind\" aims to advance the field of Cognitive Neuroscience through a comprehensive investigation into the nature of mental processes and their neural underpinnings. This interdisciplinary project seeks to understand how mental processes emerge from neural machinery, establish the basis of neurological impairments, and improve clinical management and treatment. Key components of the project include the investigation of complex mental behaviors and their cognitive processes, mapping of neural systems and their functions, and the development of innovative methods and tools to bridge brain and mental behavior. Activities will involve the convergence of experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies to develop a new type of neurocomputational model. The ultimate goal is to secure robust methods and tools for systematically bridging cognitive science and systems neuroscience, thereby providing a novel formalism for understanding the connection between brain and cognition. The models developed will mimic both normal and impaired behavior, facilitating a deeper understanding of neuroanatomy and its relationship to cognitive function. This project holds the potential to significantly impact both theoretical and clinical aspects of neuroscience."
