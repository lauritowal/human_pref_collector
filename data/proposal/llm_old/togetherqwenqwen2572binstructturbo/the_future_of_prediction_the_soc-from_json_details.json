        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine, and Policing,\" aims to investigate the profound shifts in social institutions as they transition from traditional probabilistic methods to advanced algorithmic prediction. Spanning the domains of social sciences, insurance, medicine, and policing, the project delves into the integration of Big Data, Machine Learning, and digital forecasting to enhance decision-making processes. Key research areas include personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing, each of which is poised to benefit from the individualization of prediction. However, this shift also brings significant challenges, such as the potential undermining of the mutualization principle in insurance, the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods, and the persistent problem of bias in algorithmic systems. The project seeks to address these issues by exploring the ethical, legal, and social implications of algorithmic prediction, with a particular focus on how these technologies can be deployed to balance the goals of prevention and repression. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the future landscape of algorithmic forecasting and its impact on society."
