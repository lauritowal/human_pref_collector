        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\" project aims to advance the understanding and promotion of active ageing, a concept defined by the WHO as the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security to enhance quality of life as people age. This proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to developing and validating a novel scale for assessing active ageing, focusing on the dimensions of ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy. Through a cross-sectional study of 1,000 participants aged 75, 80, and 85, the project will examine the determinants and modifiers of active ageing, particularly the roles of resilience and external support. Additionally, a multicomponent sustainable intervention will be developed and tested for feasibility and effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants. The intervention will incorporate counselling, information technology, and volunteer support to enhance the active ageing process. By comparing current data with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago, the project will also explore cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. This research will generate novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and provide evidence to support the development of effective promotion strategies. Key outcomes include the creation of a new assessment scale, training for young scientists, and contributions to the development of new concepts and theories in the field of active ageing."
