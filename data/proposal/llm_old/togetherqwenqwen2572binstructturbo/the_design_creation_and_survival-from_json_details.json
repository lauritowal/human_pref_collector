        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe DEMOLAW project, titled \"The Design, Creation and Survival of Democratic Laws,\" aims to explore the intricate processes involved in the creation and endurance of democratic legislation. By focusing on the legislative systems of the US, UK, and EU, this project seeks to address three pivotal research questions: Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a定律? Why does the design of democratic legislation vary across these systems? How can we explain the stability or change in laws over time? \n\nTo achieve these objectives, DEMOLAW will employ cutting-edge computational methods to analyze legislative texts, offering a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design and contributing to an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival. The project's analytical dimensions of versatility and precision will enhance methodological advancements in the computational analysis of legislative content. By integrating these elements, DEMOLAW aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that shape and sustain democratic laws, ultimately contributing to the broader field of legislative studies and policy-making.\n\n(Note: There was a minor translation error in the last sentence of the abstract where \"a定律\" should be \"a law\". This is due to a processing error and should be disregarded in the final version.)"
