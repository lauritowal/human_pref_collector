        "**Abstract**\n\n\"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity\" is an ambitious interdisciplinary project that aims to provide the first comprehensive study of the role and significance of play and games in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Spanning from approximately 800 BCE to 500 CE, this project will explore the diverse participation in games across social strata, including free men and slaves, men and women, adults and children, and even mythological figures. By examining a wide array of environments, from urban centers to rural landscapes, and utilizing a rich body of sources—written, archaeological, and iconographic—this study will offer a nuanced understanding of the cultural fabric woven by these activities.\n\nThe project will integrate a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological studies to create a holistic view of the subject. Additionally, it will engage with related fields such as gender studies and education studies to highlight the broader social and educational implications of play and games in antiquity.\n\nThe outcomes of this project will be multifaceted, including the development of training and research models that can be used by scholars and educators alike. Moreover, the project will produce educational materials for schools, museums, and libraries, enhancing public understanding and appreciation of the cultural significance of play in the classical world. Through these efforts, \"Locus Ludi\" seeks to fill a significant gap in the current scholarship and enrich our understanding of ancient societies."
