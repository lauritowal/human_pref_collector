        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service (LaaS),\" aims to revolutionize the field of urban logistics by developing a comprehensive framework that integrates public value, sustainability, and efficiency. The project has three primary objectives: (1) to develop a measurement system for public value in city logistics planning and management using multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization; (2) to establish principles, models, and tools for the design of LaaS infrastructure, focusing on network optimization; and (3) to create a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, which will introduce logistics markets and leverage learning-based optimization. The expected outcomes include the formulation of a new theory of city logistics, significant efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and the maximization of public value. These advancements will have profound scientific and practical implications for the transport and logistics sectors, as well as broader social, economic, and environmental benefits."
