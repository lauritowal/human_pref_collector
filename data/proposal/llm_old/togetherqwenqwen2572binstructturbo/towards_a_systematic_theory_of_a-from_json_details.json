        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"STARTDIALOG\" project, titled \"Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry,\" aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams, addressing the current lack of understanding of their logical properties and their underappreciated heuristic potential. This interdisciplinary endeavor will bridge gaps in philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science by creating a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and establishing a comprehensive database of these diagrams. The project's research strategy involves detailed analysis and classification to clarify and solve existing issues in the field, leading to an accurate understanding of the methodological importance of these diagrams. Moreover, the project will study Aristotelian diagrams as objects of independent interest, thereby enhancing their relevance and applications across various disciplines. Expected outcomes include significant breakthroughs in logical geometry, providing new insights and tools for philosophical logicians, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The impact of \"STARTDIALOG\" is anticipated to revolutionize the way Aristotelian diagrams are perceived and utilized, contributing to a more robust and interconnected academic community."
