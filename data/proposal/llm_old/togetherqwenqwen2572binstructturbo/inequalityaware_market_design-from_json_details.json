        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Inequality-aware Market Design\" aims to explore the optimal design of marketplaces where inequalities significantly impact welfare outcomes. By introducing a novel theoretical framework, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), this research seeks to address the conventional opposition to policies like rent control, health care allocation, and transit subsidies, which are often criticized for allocative inefficiency. Using a mechanism-design framework, the project will develop a welfare function that maximizes overall welfare while accounting for redistributive preferences. The research hypothesizes that under conditions where inequalities are detectable, policymakers may intentionally sacrifice some allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable surplus distribution among participants. This approach incorporates participants' private information on their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. The project's theoretical contributions include a deeper understanding of how inequality considerations can shape market design, distinguishing it from the traditional focus on efficiency and revenue. It also complements public-finance approaches through the tax system, offering new insights into the rationale behind distortionary market interventions. The findings will provide valuable guidance for policymakers in designing marketplaces that better address societal inequalities."
