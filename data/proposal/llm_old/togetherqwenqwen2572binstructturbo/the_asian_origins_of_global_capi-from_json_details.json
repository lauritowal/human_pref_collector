        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\" seeks to explore the critical role of Asian ports and the operations of European East India companies in the development of modern industrial capitalism. By focusing on the economic activities in imperial trading centers and the interactive roles of European and local merchants, this research aims to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information during the early modern period. The investigation of over 150 European factories, serving as nodes in a vast network of global trade, will provide insights into the economic dynamism of these regions and contribute to a new spatial theory of capitalist development. This project, spanning five years, will integrate large archival repositories and foster global collaborations to recast the narrative of global economic change, promoting a decolonized history of capitalism. Through this comprehensive study, we aim to challenge existing Eurocentric narratives and highlight the significant contributions of Asian economies to the emergence of global capitalism."
