        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Managing Performative Science\" (MAPS) project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding, assessing, and managing performativity in scientific practices. Focusing on the interplay between scientific activities and their real-world impacts, MAPS will explore the ethical dimensions and philosophical underpinnings of performativity in diverse fields such as economics, epidemiology, and machine learning. By bridging gaps in current philosophical guidance, this project seeks to address how scientific predictions and explanations can inadvertently shape the phenomena they aim to describe, leading to ethical risks and unintended consequences. Through interdisciplinary research, MAPS will not only deepen our theoretical understanding of performativity but also provide practical guidelines for scientists and policymakers to navigate the ethical and epistemological challenges posed by performative science. This initiative is crucial for fostering responsible research and innovation, ensuring that scientific endeavors are aligned with societal values and ethical standards."
