        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\" seeks to address critical questions in international trade theory and policy, particularly in the context of Europe, where protectionist pressures and nationalistic tendencies challenge the benefits of globalization. This research aims to reassess traditional trade models, which often assume homogenous firms, by incorporating firm-level heterogeneity to provide a more nuanced understanding of trade patterns and their welfare impacts.\n\nThe project is structured into four work packages. Work Package 1 examines market allocative efficiency, focusing on how firm heterogeneity and pricing distortions affect a country’s aggregate economic performance and the extent to which economic integration mitigates or exacerbates these inefficiencies. Work Package 2 explores the design of optimal multilateral trade policies, emphasizing the cooperative development of agreements that maximize joint welfare among trading partners. Work Package 3 investigates how country, sector, and firm characteristics interact to influence comparative advantages in response to trade liberalization. Finally, Work Package 4 delves into the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping a country’s export capabilities, particularly through the lens of the productivity distribution of producers.\n\nThis project will provide policymakers with robust evidence and theoretical insights necessary to navigate the complexities of international trade in an era of global economic transformation."
