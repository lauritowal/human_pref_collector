        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, titled \"Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45,\" seeks to explore the role and impact of Japanese military justice systems during the Asia-Pacific War. By focusing on the period from 1937 to 1945 and spanning regions including East and Southeast Asia, the research will examine how Japanese courts-martial and military courts regulated violence to achieve war goals, deter and coerce civilian populations, and bolster the legitimacy and legality of Japanâ€™s military campaigns. The project will analyze the experiences of Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy soldiers, with a particular emphasis on the outcomes of these legal processes, such as execution and harsh imprisonment. Through original archival work, the study will investigate the routinization and escalation of violence within these judicial frameworks. This interdisciplinary research, which intersects modern Japanese history and international law, aims to provide historical insights that are relevant to contemporary humanitarian issues, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the legal and ethical challenges faced in conflict zones."
