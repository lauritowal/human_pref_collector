        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\" aims to unravel the complex mechanisms of aversive learning in social contexts. Key objectives include identifying the processes by which individuals learn about others, learn from others through observation, and engage in learning during direct social interactions. This research will explore how factors such as ethnic group belonging, emotional expressiveness, moral and social status, and empathy influence these learning processes. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the project will employ experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, and manipulated virtual environments, complemented by cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The study is expected to identify and model the neural networks involved in social-emotional learning, including affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed networks. A distinctive feature of this research is the exploration of a novel social-cognitive network for social learning and a fourth network for learning through interactions, which shapes behavioral norms. The outcomes of this project could provide critical insights into the dynamics of group conflicts, norm compliance, and the underlying mechanisms of social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. By advancing our understanding of emotional learning in social interactions, this research aims to contribute to the development of more effective interventions and policies for social integration and mental health."
