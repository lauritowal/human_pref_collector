        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"What are the Origins of Empathy? A Comparative Developmental Investigation,\" seeks to explore the developmental and evolutionary roots of empathy by conducting the first comparative study in humans and bonobos. Utilizing advanced techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, the project will employ both longitudinal observations and innovative experiments. The human component of the study will focus on infants from cultures with distributed-caregiving structures, specifically Vanuatu and Samoa, while the bonobo component will include both wild and semi-captive populations. The primary research goals are to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathetic behaviors, and challenge existing perspectives on human empathy. The project hypothesizes that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans exhibit a unique motivation to improve others' emotional states and have a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange, potentially leading to human-unique sharing and cooperation. By integrating insights from biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, this interdisciplinary research aims to advance our understanding of the origins of empathy and its role in human and bonobo societies."
