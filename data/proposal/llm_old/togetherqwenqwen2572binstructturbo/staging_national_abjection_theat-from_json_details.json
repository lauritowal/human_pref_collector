        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\" aims to explore the intricate relationship between theatre and the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary times. Employing a transdisciplinary approach that combines theoretical and ethnographic research methods, this study will analyze how theatre has been instrumental in shaping and challenging the concept of 'the Turkish nation' and its Others. Key case studies include theatre productions involving Armenians post-Genocide, the negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas, Islamic theatre, Sephardic Jewish theatre, and Alevi theatre, both within Turkey and in diasporic contexts in Europe and Israel. The research seeks to provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government, question the role of theatre in the politics of belonging, and explore the interplay between artistic and everyday performances of citizenship. Additionally, the project aims to advance understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre, offering critical perspectives on cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies. This research will highlight the political tensions that define Turkey and its diasporas, contributing to broader discussions on national identity, citizenship, and cultural representation."
