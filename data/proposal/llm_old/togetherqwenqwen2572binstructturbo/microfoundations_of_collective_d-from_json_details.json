        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence\" aims to initiate a new research agenda focusing on the micro-level determinants of collective defence, particularly within key NATO member states. By integrating experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, this interdisciplinary study will examine how individual attitudes towards allied assistance form and aggregate into public opinion, and subsequently influence policy-makers. The research will test key hypotheses, including the impact of strategic context on public opinion, the limited role of public opinion in conventional direct armed aggression scenarios, and the heightened polarization and relevance of public opinion in ambiguous 'grey zone' conflicts. Methodological innovation lies in the development of novel, immersive mixed-media experiments designed to provide participants with an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience. The findings promise to offer critical insights into the mechanisms underlying public support for collective defence, with significant implications for the stability and credibility of military alliances. This project not only advances theoretical understanding but also provides actionable intelligence for policymakers to enhance alliance cohesion and responsiveness to emerging security challenges."
