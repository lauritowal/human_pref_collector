        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"BACKWARD\" project, titled \"Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of ancient human evolution and adaptation. This initiative seeks to develop and deploy next-generation palaeoproteomic workflows and advanced mass spectrometry techniques to extend molecular-based phylogenetic studies beyond the limitations of ancient DNA (aDNA). By reconstructing the evolutionary history of species that have been extinct for millions of years, BACKWARD will address key questions regarding the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and the palaeobiodiversity of hominids in Southeast Asia. The project will also explore the processes of human brain expansion and reorganization, and will develop methods for species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Beyond its academic contributions, BACKWARD envisions commercial applications in forensic medicine, the food industry, and pharmaceuticals. This collaborative effort, involving a strong partnership among leading institutions, is poised to have a transformative impact on the field, akin to the revolutionary role that aDNA research has played over the past two decades."
