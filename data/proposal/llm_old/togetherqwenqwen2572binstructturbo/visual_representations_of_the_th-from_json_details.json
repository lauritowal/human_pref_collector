        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic\" aims to conduct a comprehensive historical and anthropological analysis of the visual documentation generated during the global spread of the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). This pandemic, which claimed approximately 12 million lives, was uniquely captured through the then-emerging technology of photography, offering unprecedented insights into the social, cultural, and environmental dimensions of the outbreak. The project will focus on regions significantly affected by the plague, including China and Japan, India, Africa, and both South and North America. Led by a principal investigator and supported by three full-time postdoctoral researchers, the study will explore various aspects of the pandemic's impact, such as the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses, and burial practices, as well as issues of race, class, and discrimination. By analyzing these visual representations, the project seeks to enhance our understanding of the global network of responses to the pandemic, providing valuable historical context for contemporary public health crises."
