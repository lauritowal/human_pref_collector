        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project, titled \"The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior,\" aims to investigate the profound shifts in the news industry due to the integration of social network sites (SNS). As traditional news media experiences a decline, SNS are capturing increasing attention, transforming news into a social product. This research seeks to explore the process by which this transformation occurs and reveal its implications on political beliefs and behaviors. We propose a new model of news distribution, grounded in network logic, involving key actors such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees. The project employs innovative methodologies, combining big data analysis with small-N in-depth designs, to study the impact on both news organizations and user behavior. It includes interviews with news editors, analysis of traffic data and content, and detailed examinations of user surfing behavior through laboratory observations and physiological measurements. To assess long-term political effects, we will utilize survey panel data and web-based behavioral data over a two-year period. This research is expected to contribute a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, setting new methodological standards in audience research."
