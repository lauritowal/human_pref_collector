        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Metacognition of Concepts\" (MetCogCon) project aims to investigate the thoughts and feelings that accompany the use of concepts, a critical but underexplored area in cognitive science. Concepts are fundamental to human cognitive capabilities, serving as tools for thought that vary in dependability and suitability. This project focuses on key concepts such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, exploring how metacognitive processes influence decisions to rely on, reject, or embrace these concepts. Metacognition plays a crucial role in the selection of concepts for reasoning and induction and impacts cognitive processes competing for action control. Despite its importance, the metacognition of concepts lacks a clear theoretical framework. MetCogCon will combine analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, employ psychological model-building, and conduct experimental investigations to address this gap. The project's potential impacts include improving our understanding of cognitive control and addressing philosophical problems. Practical applications will inform reasoning policies in both everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and help determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection. The expected outcome is an enhanced understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind, contributing to broader cognitive and philosophical research."
