        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"HISTORICAL ROOTS OF CONFLICT AND DEVELOPMENT: FROM PREHISTORY TO THE COLONIZATION EXPERIENCE,\" seeks to explore the profound impact of historical factors on contemporary conflict and economic development. The project is divided into two interconnected research parts.\n\nPart 1 focuses on the effect of history on conflict and economic development, specifically within Latin America. Utilizing administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America from 1492 to 1599, this segment aims to analyze the roles of institutions and human capital in shaping economic development and conflict. Data attributes include the town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and city of arrival in the Americas. The analysis will be conducted within-country, examining variations in institutional development and human capital at the initial times of colonization to understand their long-term impacts.\n\nPart 2 investigates the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict dynamics. This part involves constructing a dataset that locates ancient conflicts using archaeological evidence. The analysis will explore the long-run dynamics of conflict, drawing from various regions to provide a broader perspective.\n\nTogether, these research parts aim to deepen our understanding of how historical events and human capital shape modern socio-economic conditions and conflict, offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers."
