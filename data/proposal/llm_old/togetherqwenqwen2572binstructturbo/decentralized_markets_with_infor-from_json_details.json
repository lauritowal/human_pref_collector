        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries\" seeks to advance the theoretical understanding of decentralized trade in settings characterized by unequal information and limited commitment. In most trading scenarios, such as those involving professional investors and individual consumers, informational asymmetries are prevalent, leading to inefficiencies that can distort market outcomes. Traditional mechanism design theories often assume strong commitment capabilities and focus on single-instance trades, which do not adequately address the complexities of real-world markets where repeated transactions are common, particularly in non-durable goods, services, and even durable but divisible goods.\n\nThis proposal outlines a systematic game-theoretic analysis aimed at uncovering the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms in decentralized markets with repeated interactions. The research will explore potential remedies to enhance market efficiency, contribute to the design of more effective market institutions, and provide valuable insights for market regulators. By focusing on the dynamics of repeated trading and the role of informational asymmetries, this project aims to fill a significant gap in the current literature and offer practical solutions to improve market performance."
