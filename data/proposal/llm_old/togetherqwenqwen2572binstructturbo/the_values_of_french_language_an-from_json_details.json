        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\" seeks to reevaluate the role of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe from 1100 to 1450. This period, characterized by significant multilingualism, saw French and Latin serve as non-local languages bridging various linguistic and cultural divides. The primary focus is on exploring the relationship between language and identity in medieval Europe, particularly how the use of French contributed to the demarcation of cognate languages and the formation of a collective European identity. The project aims to foster collaboration between scholars from European countries and North America, combining expertise in codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology. Key activities include empirical research on the textual tradition of \"L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César\" and speculative reflections on the linguistic identity of the time. By interrogating the role of the French language, this project hopes to provide new insights into the historical foundations of European identity and multilingualism."
