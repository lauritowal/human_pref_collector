        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations\" aims to assess the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy, focusing on HANK (Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian) models. This study seeks to develop an organizing framework to distinguish between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents, and conduct a comparative analysis of HANK and TANK (Two Agent New Keynesian) models. By examining the heterogeneity wedge in consumption and investment, the project aims to uncover the mechanisms through which heterogeneity impacts aggregate equilibrium dynamics. The analysis will compare HANK, TANK, and RANK (Representative Agent New Keynesian) models to better understand the channels of heterogeneity in both theoretical and actual economies. Key applications of this research include exploring the role of constrained households in enhancing wage flexibility, assessing the effects of helicopter drops on economic outcomes, and evaluating the impact of heterogeneity on optimal monetary policy. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights into how monetary policy can be tailored to address the diverse economic behaviors and needs of different segments of the population, thereby improving the effectiveness of policy responses to economic fluctuations."
