        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\" project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy by delving into the underexplored contributions of early Franciscans. Challenging the prevailing view that these thinkers were merely compilers of past doctrines, this project aims to reveal their significant originality and innovation. By employing a 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach, the study will examine how practical contexts influenced theoretical developments in scholastic texts. Key objectives include producing the first comprehensive analysis of the sources, methodologies, content, and later reception of early Franciscan thought, identifying novel elements such as the integration of Islamic sources, and bridging the gap between early and late Franciscan schools. Additionally, the project will highlight the shared philosophical identity between Muslim and Western traditions. The expected outcome is a nuanced scholarly account that not only underscores the modernity of Franciscan ideas when viewed outside their original context but also advances the field of scholasticism by redefining its contemporary study."
