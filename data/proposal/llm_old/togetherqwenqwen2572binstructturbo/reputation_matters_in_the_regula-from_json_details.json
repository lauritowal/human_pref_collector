        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability\" (RICA) seeks to challenge and reconceptualize the foundational assumptions of the regulatory state. By addressing critical issues such as the rise of non-majoritarianism and the devaluation of political processes, RICA aims to rethink the normative and institutional design principles that underpin regulatory bodies. The project is structured into two core modules. Module 1 investigates the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, hypothesizing that increased insulation may paradoxically undermine the perceived credibility of regulatory agencies. Module 2 explores how reputation shapes accountability behavior, aiming to develop new theories that better reflect the dynamic interplay between accountability and regulatory autonomy. Utilizing insights from political science literature on reputation, RICA seeks to question established wisdom and propose innovative theoretical frameworks that enhance our understanding of regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability. This project promises to provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and contribute to the broader academic discourse on regulatory governance."
