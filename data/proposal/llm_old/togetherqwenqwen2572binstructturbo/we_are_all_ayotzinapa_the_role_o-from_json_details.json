        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"We are all Ayotzinapa: The Role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\" investigates the critical role of digital media in forming and disseminating transnational memories, particularly focusing on the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. This case serves as a pivotal point to explore how new media influences citizen engagement and catalyzes counter-movements against governmental actions. Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, the study integrates theories on disappearance as a crime and digital memory, while also tracing the long transnational history of disappearance within the Hispanic world. A comparative analysis is conducted, juxtaposing Mexicoâ€™s scenario with social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, to highlight the nuanced impacts of digital media across different cultural contexts. The project aims to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries they transgress in digital memory. This research not only enriches academic discourse but also provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of memory and resistance in the digital age."
