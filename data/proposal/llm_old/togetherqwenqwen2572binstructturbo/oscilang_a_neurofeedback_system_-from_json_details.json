        "**Abstract**\n\nThe \"OsciLang\" project aims to develop an innovative, affordable, lightweight, and wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) neurofeedback system designed to detect and treat language disorders, particularly dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). This system leverages the synchronization of brain activity with changes in the speech signal, focusing on the phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity, especially in the delta and theta bands. Building on the research finding that dyslexic readers exhibit reduced auditory tracking in the delta band, OsciLang seeks to enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, thereby improving literacy skills. The system will feature a real-time EEG interface that quantifies basic parameters of brain activity, allowing users to monitor and facilitate top-down control over specific activation patterns. This is particularly beneficial in noisy environments, where traditional reading and language interventions may be less effective. The expected outcome is a significant enhancement in reading and language skills among individuals with dyslexia and SLI. Additionally, the project lays the groundwork for a broader framework and technology that can be extended to enhance reading abilities in various populations."
