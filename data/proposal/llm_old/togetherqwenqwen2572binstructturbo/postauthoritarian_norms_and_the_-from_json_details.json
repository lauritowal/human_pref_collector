        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships,\" seeks to investigate the enduring impact of past authoritarian regimes on the ideological landscape of new democracies, particularly in Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe. Through survey experiments, the project aims to develop a theory explaining the rejection of ideologies associated with former dictatorships and its effects on political competition. Key areas of inquiry include the decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the higher incidence of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. The research will explore how voters and parties navigate the legacy of authoritarianism, influencing national identity, political discourse, and the supply of new parties. Expected outcomes include a new theoretical framework elucidating the heterogeneity of political competition in new democracies, contributing to a deeper understanding of post-authoritarian political dynamics."
