        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Florilegia Syriaca\" project aims to explore the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought within Syriac and Arabic contexts during the first millennium CE. This critical period saw the flourishing of Syriac Christianity as a significant cultural mediator, a role that remains underappreciated in contemporary scholarship. The project seeks to illuminate the rich yet understudied corpus of Syriac and Christian Arabic sources, defining the religious identity of Syriac Christians and enhancing our understanding of their cultural dynamics. Key objectives include the creation of open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia, which served as cultural creativity laboratories in the 2nd to 6th centuries, and the in-depth study of the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors from the 8th to 11th centuries. By producing and analyzing these florilegia, which bridge European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures, the project will contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of the intellectual history of both regions. The research outcomes are expected to improve our understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity, highlight the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East, and provide valuable insights into the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians. This endeavor is crucial for enriching Europe's current religious discourses and fostering a deeper appreciation of the shared intellectual legacies of diverse Christian traditions."
