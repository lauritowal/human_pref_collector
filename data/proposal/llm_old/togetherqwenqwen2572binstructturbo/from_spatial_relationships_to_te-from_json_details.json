        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"From Spatial Relationships to Temporal Correlations: New Vistas on Predictive Coding\" aims to advance our understanding of gamma waves (30-80 Hz) in the visual cortex, focusing on their roles in cortical communication, synaptic plasticity, and predictive coding. This research explores how gamma waves encode top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors, facilitating learning and the updating of priors. We hypothesize that gamma waves not only carry prediction errors but also signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs through long-range synchronization, enabling distinct brain areas to predict each other's visual input. Utilizing a combination of deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the study will quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision across marmosets and humans. Key variables include predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns, with a particular interest in how gamma waves depend on experience and perceptual learning. An optogenetic approach will be employed to investigate the role of gamma waves in driving perceptual learning, with the expectation that gamma waves in the primary visual cortex (V1) are modulated by top-down feedback. The anticipated outcome is robust evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves, integrating information transmission and sensory evidence integration, which could provide insights into and potential treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders."
