        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics,\" seeks to explore the role of nationalism in polarizing electoral politics across advanced democracies and to assess the potential for national identities to foster unity. The project challenges the prevailing transnational cleavage theory, which attributes political polarization to cultural conflicts, by introducing a nuanced perspective that focuses on the diverse forms of nationalism. Employing a multi-method comparative research design, the proposal outlines three key work packages: (1) the analysis of novel survey data to understand how public perceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions, (2) an examination of elite mobilization strategies that leverage different types of nationalism, and (3) an exploration of the effects of elite appeals to national identity on public opinion and partisan antagonism. The expected outcomes include significant contributions to academic research and a richer public discourse on addressing societal challenges. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which nationalism affects political behavior and societal cohesion, offering insights that can inform both scholarly and policy debates."
