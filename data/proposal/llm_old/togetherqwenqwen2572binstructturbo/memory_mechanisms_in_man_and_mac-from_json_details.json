        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\" project seeks to validate a set of 10 provocative claims about long-term memory, integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development. This highly interdisciplinary endeavor will explore the robustness of human sensory memory, the role of attention-related brain oscillations, and the potential of specific neuronal structures, such as \"Grandmother Cells,\" in long-term memory storage. By employing advanced imaging techniques, including fMRI, EEG, and intracerebral recordings from epileptic patients, alongside sophisticated computer simulations of spiking neural networks, the project aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories. Additionally, the development of bio-inspired hardware that mimics brain memory systems will be pursued, leveraging memristor-like devices to potentially enhance artificial computing architectures. Through these comprehensive studies, the project will not only deepen our understanding of human memory but also pave the way for innovative applications in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing."
