        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\" aims to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the innovative ways the Latin Aristotle was read and understood during the late medieval and early modern periods. Focusing on the 12th and 13th centuries, this study will explore the textual variance present in the hundreds of handwritten manuscripts that preserve these translations, with particular emphasis on critical treatises such as \"De anima,\" \"De generatione et corruptione,\" and \"De caelo.\" By meticulously documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses, the project seeks to highlight the significance of textual fluidity and its impact on the understanding and interpretation of philosophical and scientific texts. This research not only underscores how medieval readers were exposed to translations that differed fundamentally from the Greek originals but also aims to develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations. This model will enhance our understanding of the dynamic interactions between philosophy, science, and theology during a crucial period of intellectual history."
