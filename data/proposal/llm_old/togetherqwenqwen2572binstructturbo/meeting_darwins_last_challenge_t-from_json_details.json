        "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal, \"Meeting Darwin's Last Challenge: Toward a Global Tree of Human Languages and Genes,\" aims to bridge the gap between linguistic and genetic classification, advancing our understanding of human evolutionary history. Building on the foundational work of molecular biology in species and population classification, as highlighted by Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994), we propose a novel approach to correlate language families with classical genetic markers. Current language classification methods, such as the classical method and mass comparison, are limited by their narrow scope and probabilistic unreliability. In response, we adopt the method proposed by Longobardi and Guardiano (2009), which utilizes grammatical evidence and modern linguistic tools to establish more robust and replicable classifications, capable of measuring linguistic distances between remote populations.\n\nOur project involves a collaborative effort between linguists and biologists to select and sample significant populations for comprehensive language and gene analysis. Utilizing the latest genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome markers, and mitochondrial DNA, we will apply advanced biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and explore its relationship with linguistic diversity. This initiative seeks to validate Darwin's prediction of a parallel isomorphy between the trees of languages and populations, offering a unified perspective on human evolutionary and migratory patterns."
