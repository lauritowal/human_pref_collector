        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\" (TIME) aims to revolutionize the understanding of higher-level vision by studying it in a more natural and dynamic setting. TIME seeks to explore vision as an active process geared towards semantic understanding, emphasizing the role of active information sampling and the integration of visual information across multiple timeframes. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach, the project will employ non-invasive human brain imaging, advanced multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modeling to dissect the mechanisms of visual semantic understanding. Specifically, TIME will involve the visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich, human-annotated natural scenes, the development of novel multivariate analysis methods, and the creation of a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision. The primary goals are to establish the temporal, spatial, and functional dynamics of visual semantic understanding in the brain and to integrate this information into a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. This research promises a paradigm shift in how vision is studied, modeled, and understood, offering new insights into complex neural processes under ecologically valid conditions and fostering a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision systems."
