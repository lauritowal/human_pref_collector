        "**Abstract**\n\nThe Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project aims to elucidate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior through a multidisciplinary approach that integrates empirical, computational, and robot-based methodologies. This project seeks to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action by identifying the neuronal principles that underpin conscious processes. A key hypothesis is that the transition to a world dominated by intentional agents necessitates the development of novel control architectures. These architectures will feature parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation, complemented by a second level of control that ensures coherence and supports a conscious scene. The conscious scene is hypothesized to play crucial roles in credit assignment and planning beyond immediate sensory information. The project's outcomes are expected to include a framework that advances beyond the current state of the art, system-level models of conscious architecture, and computational studies of the neuronal substrate. Empirical validation will be conducted using both a humanoid robot and stroke patients, alongside the development of advanced tools for these purposes. By addressing fundamental questions about the function and genesis of consciousness, this project will significantly advance our understanding of the mind and brain, provide new neurorehabilitation technologies, and contribute to the development of a new generation of robots with advanced social competence."
