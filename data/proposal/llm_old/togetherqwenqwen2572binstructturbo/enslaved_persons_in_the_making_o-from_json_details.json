        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"SLaVEgents\" project, \"Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE,\" seeks to explore the multifaceted roles and agency of enslaved individuals in the historical development of ancient societies and cultures. Led by a Principal Investigator and supported by a team of 8 senior researchers, 7 post-doctoral researchers, and 3 PhD candidates, this interdisciplinary endeavor will delve into the dynamic identities, communities, and networks of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa. By examining sources in languages such as Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, the project aims to uncover the significant influence of enslaved individuals on historical changes. Expected outputs include a digital prosopography, a monograph, two collective volumes, 15 articles, 3 PhD dissertations, 3 workshops, an international conference, and a dedicated project website. This comprehensive research will provide a nuanced understanding of the lives and contributions of enslaved people, challenging traditional narratives and enriching our knowledge of ancient history."
