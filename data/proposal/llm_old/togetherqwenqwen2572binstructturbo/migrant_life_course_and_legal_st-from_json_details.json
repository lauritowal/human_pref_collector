        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\" project seeks to explore the critical junctures and impacts of citizenship on migrant integration, particularly focusing on how variations in policy influence legal status transitions and subsequent integration outcomes. This comprehensive study aims to model the legal status transitions of immigrants and their children as significant life course events, examining the relevance of citizenship acquisition on critical aspects such as employment, income, living conditions, health, out-migration, and educational attainment. By developing innovative methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and the impact of policy, the project will test its models using a rich combination of longitudinal register-based and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries. The findings will provide essential insights to inform targeted citizenship policies, ultimately aiming to enhance the settlement success and integration of migrant populations."
