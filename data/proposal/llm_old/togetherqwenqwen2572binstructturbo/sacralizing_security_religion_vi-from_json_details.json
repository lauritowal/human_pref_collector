        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" (SACRASEC) aims to investigate the phenomenon of religious vigilantes in mega-cities where state agencies often lack the capacity to provide adequate infrastructure and security. Through an ethnographic comparison, the project will explore why residents in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta grant authority to religious vigilantes and the role of religion in legitimizing their practices. By analyzing the interactions between religious organizations, non-state security actors, and state actors, SACRASEC seeks to understand how these vigilantes operate alongside formal authorities to maintain order. The research will focus on the specific contributions of Christian, Islamic, and Indigenous religious traditions to the production of authority in these contexts. This study aims to extend the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, provide insights into the power structures of mega-cities in the Global South, and contribute to policy recommendations for enhancing human security."
