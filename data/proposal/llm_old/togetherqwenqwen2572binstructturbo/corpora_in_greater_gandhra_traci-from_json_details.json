        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era,\" aims to explore the evolution of Buddhism through the lens of Indic textual materials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India. The project focuses on the critical analysis of Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts, which have recently come to light through the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, including philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, the study will investigate the textual and material production, transmission, and the intricate relationship networks that underpinned the spread of these manuscripts during the first millennium CE. The outcomes of this research will be disseminated through a comprehensive digital archive, an akṣara database, digital preservation efforts, editions and translations of key texts, and in-depth feature studies focusing on textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. Additionally, the project will facilitate cross-linguistic content comparison, enhancing our understanding of the dynamic and interconnected nature of Buddhist textual traditions in the Greater Gandhāra region."
