        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"REFORMED: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector\" aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the adoption, reformulation, and effects of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies across a range of countries with varying administrative traditions and levels of development. This research is driven by the global reform pressures exerted by international organizations like the OECD, which promote SAWA policies as a means to enhance educational outcomes and equity. REFORMED addresses key questions concerning the dissemination of these policies, the extent of policy convergence in education, the contextual and institutional circumstances influencing SAWA policies, and their impact on learning outcomes and equity. The project fills critical research gaps characterized by inconclusive and mixed findings through a robust, multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods. It examines the stages of policy from their inception in global agendas to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts, involving key actors such as international bureaucrats and teachers. By focusing on institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes, REFORMED seeks to offer actionable insights that can guide future educational reforms and policy-making."
