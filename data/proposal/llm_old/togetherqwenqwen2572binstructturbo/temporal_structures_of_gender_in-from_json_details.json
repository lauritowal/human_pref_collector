        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Temporal Structures of Gender Inequalities in Asian and Western Welfare Regimes,\" aims to explore the dynamics of gender inequality within the context of different welfare regimes using Esping-Andersen’s 'three worlds' framework. The project focuses on the comparative analysis of gender roles, welfare systems, and time use patterns in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with an additional comparative lens on Western societies. By examining key concepts such as unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, and the gender division of labor, this study seeks to uncover how social policies and modern technology influence these aspects. The research will also delve into the broader implications of these factors on social inequality, care provision, domestic labor, and leisure time. Utilizing cross-national and historical comparative methods, the study will draw on time diary data and household panel data to analyze the impact of various welfare regimes on family outcomes at the household, societal, and life course levels. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights into the structural and temporal dimensions of gender inequality, offering a nuanced understanding of how different welfare policies shape gender relations and family dynamics in East Asian and Western contexts."
