        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\" seeks to investigate the critical role of social information in adolescent development, particularly in academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking, which are often exacerbated by social media and viral challenges. This project aims to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models to understand how and why adolescents seek and process social information. By treating adolescents as active information seekers, the research will involve the development of innovative experimental tasks, the application of computational models in conjunction with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), and the analysis of real peer social networks. The study will explore key research questions, such as when adolescents decide to search for social information and whom they choose to learn from, using a combination of experimental designs, computational approaches, and social network analyses. The expected outcomes include significant insights into the role of social information in shaping adolescent behavior, advancing our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and informing the development of targeted interventions to promote positive developmental outcomes. This interdisciplinary approach will bridge gaps in current knowledge and provide a robust foundation for future research and practical applications in adolescent health and education."
