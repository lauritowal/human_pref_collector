        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\" seeks to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, addressing the critical research question of whether these bodies have the potential to enhance democratic practices. Grounded in theoretical perspectives that posit both the potential for multi-party elections to prolong autocracies and their capacity to incrementally increase democratic governance, this study confronts the opaque nature of authoritarian regimes and the limited existing research on African cases. Employing a mixed methods design, the project will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data through content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. The investigation will focus on key areas including law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness, across seven African countries. With a strong team of partner institutions, the project aims to fill a significant gap in the literature by collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which legislatures can influence democratic outcomes in these contexts."
