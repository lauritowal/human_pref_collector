        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\" seeks to explore the global dispersal and interconnected experiences of Eastern Christians from the 16th to the 18th centuries. This transnational research initiative, led by a Principal Investigator and supported by a team of multiple researchers, aims to uncover the rich and diverse histories of Christian communities that migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. Utilizing a global and connected historical framework, the project will analyze source materials from three continents, spanning ten languages and archived in dozens of locations. The core methodological approaches include philology and source criticism, essential for interpreting the multilingual and multicultural archives. The project's conceptual challenge lies in bridging the gap between micro-scale everyday life and the broader narratives of global history. Expected outcomes include scholarly publications, a searchable database, and a series of workshops designed to disseminate findings and engage with academic and public audiences. By linking the local with the global, this project will contribute significantly to the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, offering new insights into the complex tapestry of early modern Eastern Christian communities."
