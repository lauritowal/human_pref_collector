        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project, titled \"Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods,\" aims to advance social science research by addressing methodological challenges in studying complex societal issues such as climate change, politics, and vaccination. These challenges include the indirect observability of constructs such as values, climate change beliefs, and political beliefs, which can lead to measurement errors and underestimated effects. Additionally, the varying processes across different groups, such as the diverse drivers of climate change beliefs in regions with differing weather patterns, complicate the identification of similar or different regression effects. Measurement inequivalence or non-invariance, often due to translation issues, further invalidates comparisons among constructs.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel methodological framework: a mixture multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. This framework will employ clustering techniques to identify subsets of groups with common underlying processes, thereby facilitating more accurate and meaningful comparisons. The inclusion of flexible measurement models within this framework will account for non-invariance, enhancing the validity of the analysis. To ensure broad applicability and accessibility, the proposed methods will be implemented in freely available software, enabling researchers worldwide to apply these advanced techniques to large-scale survey data.\n\nThis project will significantly enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between societal constructs and threats, providing actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop more effective interventions and policies."
