        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability\" (WEALTHTRAJECT) project aims to systematically document and analyze the variability in wealth trajectories over individualsâ€™ lifetimes. This pioneering research will identify the intragenerational and intergenerational factors that influence these trajectories, focusing on how family background affects wealth accumulation. By combining longitudinal survey and register data with original life history data, WEALTHTRAJECT will provide a comprehensive understanding of the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses. The project will employ advanced quantitative methods to uncover the mechanisms behind wealth inequality and trajectory variability. This novel approach not only highlights the complexity of wealth accumulation but also offers insights into how social and economic policies can better address wealth disparities. WEALTHTRAJECT is poised to fill a significant gap in the literature by providing a detailed, long-term perspective on wealth dynamics, ultimately contributing to more equitable economic policies and practices."
