        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"The Multisensory Mind: From Neural Mechanisms to Cognition\" seeks to advance the field of multisensory integration (MI) by exploring the neural and neurochemical markers that underpin the merging of sensory inputs into coherent percepts. Utilizing a combination of human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this project aims to test a novel hypothesis concerning the synchronized activity of neural populations in the context of MI. The study will involve both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, providing insights into the mechanisms of MI and its potential disruptions in clinical populations. By elucidating these mechanisms, the research could significantly enhance our understanding of multisensory integration and contribute to the development of targeted treatments for conditions characterized by impaired MI. This work is poised to bridge the gap between neural mechanisms and cognitive processes, offering a comprehensive view of multisensory integration and its implications for human cognition and health."
