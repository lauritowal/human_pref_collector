        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary proposal, titled \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture,\" addresses the global crisis of material depletion by focusing on the transition to bio-based materials in architecture. The project tackles key challenges such as the representation, conceptualization, and operationalization of bio-based materials, aiming to redefine the fundamental value proposition and lifespan of materials in architecture. By integrating glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria, the proposed eco-metabolistic framework seeks to develop carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions. Utilizing research-by-design methods, the project will employ computational modeling networks for predictive modeling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. The concept of continual construction beyond building completion will be explored, challenging traditional design agency and proposing participatory, sustainable, and socially conscious models of production. This innovative approach aims to foster a new paradigm in sustainable architecture, aligning with the urgent need for environmentally responsible practices."
