        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility\" (LABFLEX) aims to investigate the multifaceted impacts of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization, technological change, and workplace transformation. By focusing on developments such as outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs, LABFLEX seeks to address critical concerns related to wage inequality and the division of resources in society. The project will explore whether job contract differences stem from worker preferences or technological advancements, and examine the effects of job contract flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps. Additionally, it will assess whether workers are adequately compensated for adverse work conditions or higher income risks and analyze shifts in rent sharing between workers and firms. LABFLEX will employ a multifaceted approach, combining the linking of register data with experimental evidence on worker preferences, the analysis of a full-text corpus of job vacancies, and the integration of experimental and structural methods. The outcomes of this project will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, offering a detailed picture of both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. This comprehensive study will facilitate a deeper understanding of labor market dynamics and inform the development of effective labor market policies."
