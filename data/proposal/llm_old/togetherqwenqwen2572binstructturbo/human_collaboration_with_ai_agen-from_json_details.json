        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal, titled \"Human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance: organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI,\" aims to explore the dynamics of human-AI interaction in the realm of big data-informed national health governance. Through a multi-sited ethnographic approach, the project will investigate the socio-cultural and organizational contexts that influence data analysts and medical experts in their decisions to adhere to or depart from AI-generated recommendations. By conducting research in six distinct national settings, this study seeks to fill critical gaps in the current understanding of ethical AI and algorithmic ethics, particularly focusing on the empirical evidence of human intervention in AI processes. The primary goal is to develop a robust theory on the organizational factors that promote ethical AI practices. Utilizing future-scenarioing anthropological methods, the project will integrate anthropological insights directly into AI development, ensuring that the technological advancements are aligned with human values and ethical standards. Partnerships with health decision-makers and policy institutions will be established to translate the findings into actionable policies that can enhance national health governance and positively impact individual human lives. This research is poised to make a significant contribution to the field, influencing both the development of AI systems and the formulation of national health policies."
