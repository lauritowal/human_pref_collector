        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire: A bio-archaeological project on resilience and collapse in early Christian development of the Negev Desert\" aims to explore the contexts of collapse and resilience in the 4th-7th century AD Byzantine early Christian urban centers of the Negev Desert. This innovative and data-intensive study employs an integrative approach to understand the socio-political and technological dynamics that sustained complex societies in resource-limited environments. Key research questions focus on social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the impact of the plague. Utilizing a multidisciplinary methodology, including archaeology of households, landscapes, and garbage, along with biomolecular, botanical, zoological, geological, chronometric, and artifact analyses, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influenced the sustainability and eventual decline of these ancient urban centers. The findings will contribute to a critical re-evaluation of current knowledge and offer nuanced insights into the limitations and potentials of human ingenuity in sustainable development, particularly in marginal regions, which are increasingly relevant in today's global context. Despite the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, this project promises to enhance our understanding of societal vulnerability and resilience in the face of environmental and social challenges."
