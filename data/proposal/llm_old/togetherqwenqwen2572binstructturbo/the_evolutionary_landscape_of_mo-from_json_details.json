        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"The evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa\" (NGIPALAJEM) seeks to delve into the complex interplay between environmental changes and the evolution of Homo sapiens over the past 750,000 years, with a focus on the African continent. This research is anchored in the significant climatic changes that began around 1.4 million years ago, leading to the Extended Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), a period marked by greater climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase lasting approximately 1 million years. The EMPT is believed to have profoundly impacted the large mammal community, a change that may have coincided with the end of this transitional period.\n\nNGIPALAJEM aims to establish empirical benchmarks to address major evolutionary questions by conducting fieldwork in the Turkana Basin. The primary objectives include adding to the hominin fossil record and expanding the large vertebrate fossil record, with a particular focus on the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas. Recent discoveries of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins have highlighted the phenotypic diversity of this period, which will be further explored using novel morphometric and analytical techniques.\n\nThe project will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses to provide new insights into the human evolutionary process within the African landscape over the last million years. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how environmental changes influenced human evolution and the development of modern human characteristics in Africa."
