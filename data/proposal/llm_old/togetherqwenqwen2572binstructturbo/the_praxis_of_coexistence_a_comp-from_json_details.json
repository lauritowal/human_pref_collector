        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\" seeks to explore the practical and spontaneous mechanisms that enable ethno-religious coexistence in diverse communities across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. This research program employs a comparative and inductive methodology to understand how communities navigate and accommodate differences, focusing on the everyday practices of coexistence. The primary objectives are to uncover the spontaneous methods used for coexistence, inform better policy-making through empirical insights, highlight community expectations for peaceful coexistence, and identify the resources that maintain civil relations and prevent conflict. By focusing on ordinary coexistence in settings of religious and ethnic diversity, the project aims to open a theoretical and normative space for a variety of approaches to coexistence, emphasizing the importance of cultural context and existing practices in addressing diversity challenges. Key research questions include how communities spontaneously accommodate differences and the specific resources they utilize to maintain harmony and avoid conflict. This comprehensive study will contribute valuable insights into the practical aspects of coexistence, providing a robust foundation for policymakers and community leaders."
