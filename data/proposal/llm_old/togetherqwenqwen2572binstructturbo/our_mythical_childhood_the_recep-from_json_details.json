        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\" aims to develop a pioneering approach to the reception of Classical Antiquity in contemporary children’s and young adults’ culture. By examining how ancient myths and narratives are reinterpreted and integrated into modern media, this study seeks to offer profound insights into identity formation and the initiation into adulthood. Unlike previous research, which has predominantly focused on Western cultures, this project will apply a broader, more inclusive regional perspective, avoiding pejorative implications and fostering a comparative study of reception models across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. This innovative approach will explore the influence of popular culture on the understanding of Classical Antiquity, highlighting its role in shaping key social, political, and cultural transformations. The research will be conducted by an international team of scholars, aiming to produce a supra-regional survey of classical references, detailed analyses of crucial reception cases, and educational materials on ancient myths tailored for disabled children. The project's broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture is expected to contribute significantly to global integration and cultural exchange, fostering a deeper appreciation of our shared heritage and the diverse ways in which it is reimagined for new generations."
