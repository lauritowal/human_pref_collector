        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\" (BIGlobal) aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power, offering new insights into welfare and policy in the context of globalization. Drawing on EC 2007, this research will incorporate a richer understanding of firm behavior into models of international trade, focusing on how trade and industrial policies impact growth, particularly in less developed markets. Key research questions include the role of trade and competition policy in ensuring consumer benefits from globalization, the effects of domestic policies on small farmers' gains from trade, the influence of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages, and the impact of banking globalization on the real sector. Over a five-year period, the project will integrate theoretical work with rich data from developing economies, expanding the knowledge frontier on trade and industrial policy and providing a robust basis for informed policymaking. Through this comprehensive approach, BIGlobal seeks to enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of firm growth and market power in a globalized world."
