        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project seeks to explore and understand the profound impact of artificial agents on the social dynamics within families. By integrating insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction, this initiative aims to establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to study family neurocognition. The project's objectives include describing developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents and identifying how these interactions can support households managing chronic illnesses. Methodologically, F-AI-MILY will develop a mobile lab to assess social dynamics influenced by artificial agents, measure behavioral and neurological responses of family members, and evaluate the impact of artificial agents on child development and family life over extended periods. Specifically, the project will focus on families with children aged 4-12. The ultimate aim is to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented clarity and to transform maladaptive social patterns into adaptive ones, particularly in families coping with chronic illnesses. Through an interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, and full-circle approach, F-AI-MILY aspires to guide the development of artificial agents that enhance family well-being and resilience."
