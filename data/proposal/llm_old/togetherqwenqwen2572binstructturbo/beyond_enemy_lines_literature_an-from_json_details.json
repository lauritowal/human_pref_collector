        "This project, \"Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949,\" aims to conduct the first detailed survey of the cultural landscape in these zones. By investigating the cross-fertilization of Anglo/American and German literature and film, it seeks to provide a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, contributing to the history of the Allied Occupation. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that combines literature, film history, critical analysis, and cultural history, the study will explore the intertwining of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literatures and their relationship to the onset of the Cold War."
