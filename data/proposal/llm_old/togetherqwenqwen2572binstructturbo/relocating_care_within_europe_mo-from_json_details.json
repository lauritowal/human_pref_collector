        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the Elderly to Places Where Care is More Affordable\" aims to explore the transnationalization of care, particularly the relocation of elderly individuals from Austria and Germany to care homes in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. This multi-sited anthropological study will delve into the phenomenon of \"grandmother deportation\" and \"geriatric colonialism,\" examining how the marketization of care and the entanglement of welfare states across borders impact elderly care. By comparing costs that are one-third of those in home countries, the research will uncover the implications of this trend on labor migration, real estate investment, and state insurances. The study will also investigate the management of care homes by former migrant care workers and international companies, and the historical context rooted in German and Habsburg-Hungarian legacies. Through in-depth ethnographic studies and investigations of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, this project seeks to understand the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and how care relocation shapes the future of elderly care in an interconnected Europe."
