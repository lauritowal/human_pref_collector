        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\" aims to explore the systematic and meaningful communication observed in great ape gestures and its implications for the evolution of human language. This research will address three primary objectives: (1) to examine cultural variations in ape gestures across different species, physical environments, and social contexts; (2) to determine if the combination of signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and to analyze the mechanisms by which meaning is constructed; and (3) to conduct a comparative study of gesture use and comprehension between humans and apes, focusing on both adults and children. The methodology involves a comprehensive pan-African data collection effort, spanning 17 ape and 9 human groups. It will investigate the influence of species-specific, environmental, and social factors on gesture acquisition and use, as well as the syntactic structure of combined signals. This project is significant as it addresses fundamental questions about the origins of human language, exploring core linguistic features such as social learning and syntactic structure within the framework of ape communication. By bridging the gap between human and ape gestural communication, this research will contribute valuable insights into the evolutionary roots of language."
