        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges\" aims to conduct a pioneering, comparative social-science study of reparations within the context of global development. This research will examine reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments, focusing on how these payments are established, implemented, and received. By integrating perspectives from economics, morality, and politics, the project will explore the implications of reparations in addressing global development challenges. A key objective is to identify the nature of reparations as a form of wealth transfer and to analyze the 'reparative aspects' of economic life. This study is novel in its approach, utilizing innovative theories and methods from economic anthropology to broaden the comparative frame of reparations research. The findings will contribute significantly to our understanding of reparations and their role in fostering equitable development, providing valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and practitioners."
