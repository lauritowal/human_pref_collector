        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe Swedish Historical Database Project aims to compile and publicly release highly detailed, disaggregated data for approximately 2,500 Swedish administrative districts spanning from 1749 to 1952. This comprehensive dataset will cover a wide array of variables, including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agricultural statistics, and infrastructure investments, with over 500,000 observations per variable. The project's unique strength lies in its provision of continuous and reliable population data, offering a local-level perspective that is rare in historical datasets. This resource will support empirical research using advanced identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation. The database is anticipated to contribute significantly to the fields of economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development, building on related work currently under review in Econometrica. Future research plans include exploring the economic development and growth trajectories of Sweden, leveraging this rich historical data to provide new insights into long-term economic trends."
