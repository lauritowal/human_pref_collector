        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged,\" aims to address the significant public health issue of depression in the elderly, which affects 1-3% of the population with clinically significant symptoms in 8-16%. Despite these statistics, the detection rate remains below 20%, and treatment effectiveness is only moderate. Our project focuses on insomnia, a prevalent risk factor affecting up to 40% of the elderly, which independently increases the risk of developing depression by 13%. The primary goal is to develop a preventive intervention that targets insomnia to mitigate the onset of depression. We will achieve this through early identification of at-risk individuals, quantification of underlying mechanisms, and enrollment in home-applicable intervention protocols. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach involving multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging, we aim to identify subtypes of insomnia and their associated neural mechanisms. This will facilitate the creation of personalized, internet-supported intervention strategies optimized for sleep improvement and depression prevention. Our outcomes will contribute to the broader understanding of the relationship between sleep and mood disorders, offering a scalable solution to a critical health challenge in the aging population."
