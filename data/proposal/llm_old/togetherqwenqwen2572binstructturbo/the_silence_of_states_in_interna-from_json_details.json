        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project, titled \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" represents a pioneering exploration into the understudied phenomenon of State silence and inaction within the international legal framework. This study aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the various forms of State silence, analyze their legal ramifications, and critically assess whether existing laws adequately address these scenarios or if reforms are necessary. By employing a multi-faceted research approach, including the analysis of State practices in all six official UN languages, examination of international jurisprudence, and empirical studies of reasoning from government officials and international judges, this project seeks to uncover the binding nature of State silence, its role in State responsibility, and its impact on international dispute resolution. The findings will be of significant interest to a wide range of stakeholders, including States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals, contributing to a deeper understanding and potential evolution of international legal norms."
