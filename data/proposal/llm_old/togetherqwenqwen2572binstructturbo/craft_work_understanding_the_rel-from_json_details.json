        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project, titled \"Craft Work: Understanding the Relationship Between Identity and Work in the Context of the Future of Work,\" is a multi-methodological, pan-European study focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors within the European Union. This research aims to develop a new interpretative framework that elucidates the complex relationship between identity and work, particularly in the context of emerging forms of labor. By combining digital methods with qualitative research, CRAFTWORK will provide the first comprehensive inquiry into neo-craft work in the EU, addressing significant societal challenges related to the future of work. The project will explore subjects' perceptions of class location, cultural conceptions of social status, and the urban-rural distribution of neo-craft workers, while also examining the role of social media in shaping these dynamics. Theoretical innovations include rethinking interpretative categories for identity and work studies, offering critical insights into the pathways to work and the evolving nature of labor in a rapidly changing world."
