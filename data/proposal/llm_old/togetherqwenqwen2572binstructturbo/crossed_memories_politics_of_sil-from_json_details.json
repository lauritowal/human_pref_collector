        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times\" (CROME) seeks to explore the memories and silences surrounding the wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. Employing a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will examine the role of states in the mobilisation, articulation, recognition, and selective representation of these conflicts in Portugal and its former African colonies: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe. The project posits that these wars have triggered both memorialisation and silencing, each with its own historicity. Two primary strands will guide the research: \"Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States,\" focusing on the state's role in shaping collective memory, and \"Memory as a Battlefield,\" which investigates the uses of the past and the dynamics between social and individual memories. CROME aims to produce innovative knowledge on war memories and silences, contrast changes from the end of the conflicts to the present, and examine historical judgements and memories in both Portugal and the African countries involved. By offering a new perspective in the study of colonial-liberation wars, CROME addresses the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism, contributing to a deeper understanding of the postcolonial era."
