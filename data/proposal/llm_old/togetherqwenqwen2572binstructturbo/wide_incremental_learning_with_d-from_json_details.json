        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal titled \"Wide Incremental Learning with Discrimination Networks\" (WIDE) aims to revolutionize our understanding of language processing by moving beyond traditional phonetic and word-based models. Drawing on the evolution of human language over 50,000 years and the invention of alphabets 3,000 years ago, this project critically examines Western linguistic paradigms and explores the unique features of the Chinese writing system, characterized by juxtaposed characters and context-dependent interpretations. The research employs wide learning networks, specifically two-layer architectures with many thousands of units, driven by the simplest error-driven learning rules to mimic human processing capabilities. This approach is designed to match the strengths and weaknesses of human language comprehension, particularly in early childhood literacy training. The project aligns with current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence, aiming to advance auditory comprehension, model diverse languages, extend speech production capabilities, and develop a discrimination-based theory of language. By challenging the alphabet-centric view, WIDE seeks to uncover how low-level acoustic properties directly influence the reduction of uncertainty in speech signals, thereby enriching our understanding of language and its computational models. Funding is requested to support this innovative research program."
