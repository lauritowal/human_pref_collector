        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Network Epistemology in Practice\" aims to explore the dynamics of knowledge generation and validation within large scientific collaborations, focusing on particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). By analyzing internal communications such as e-mails and internal wiki pages, this study seeks to reconstruct the collective research processes that underpin scientific discoveries. Utilizing tools from digital humanities, the project will address the methodological challenges of capturing and analyzing large-scale, complex research processes. Key objectives include the development of historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources and the adaptation of theoretical models of network epistemology to better understand collective knowledge generation. This interdisciplinary approach, combining history and philosophy of science with computational methods, will not only contribute to our understanding of how science is conducted in large collaborations but also provide practical strategies for future research. The project's innovative use of digital tools and methodologies will set new standards for epistemological analysis in the digital age."
