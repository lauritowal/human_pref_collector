        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\" aims to comprehensively explore the increasing event of widowhood, a phenomenon underdeveloped in comparison to divorce research, yet critical in ageing societies. This study will address the cut in survival benefits in many countries and the broader implications for mental health and economic stability post-bereavement. Employing a novel four-pronged approach, the project will investigate the risk and duration of widowhood, the associated vulnerabilities, and the social inequalities faced by different demographic groups, including socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age. Additionally, the research will examine country-specific differences and temporal changes, leveraging high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, spanning from 1985 to projected estimates up to 2050. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, the project seeks to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates, offering insights into the challenges faced by the widowed population and their family members. The outcomes will facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems, contributing to more informed policy-making and social support strategies."
