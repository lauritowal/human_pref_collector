        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe METABODY project introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining, aimed at exploring the dynamic inference of body image through the integration of prior expectations and new sensory information. This proposal is particularly relevant in modern contexts, where the balance between identity invariance and invention is increasingly negotiated through body modifications. The study will delve into body image as a process of dynamic inference, focusing on the interplay between established beliefs and emergent data. It will also investigate the metacognitive aspects of body image, hypothesizing that disturbances in body image are linked to impairments in both first-order (direct experience) and second-order (reflective) cognitive abilities.\n\nMETABODY is structured around three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition, which examines the equilibrium between internal embodied experiences and external viewpoints; Body Mentalizing, which explores the balance between personal and social perspectives on body image; and Body Decision Making, which considers the integration of present, future, and ideal body perspectives in decision-making processes. Through these investigations, METABODY seeks to deepen our understanding of how individuals negotiate their identities in the face of diverse body modification options, ultimately contributing to the broader fields of psychology, neuroscience, and social science."
