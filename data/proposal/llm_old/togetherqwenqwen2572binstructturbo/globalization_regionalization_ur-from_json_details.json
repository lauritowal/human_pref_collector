        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe project \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century\" aims to map the evolving spatial patterns of the global economy from a maritime perspective over nearly 300 years. Utilizing vessel movement data from Lloyd's List register, starting from 1734, this research will produce dynamic and interactive visualizations to explore the spatial distribution of maritime flows. By applying methods such as graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks, the project will analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links, comparing these structures to general models of networks. The study will also examine the macroscopic measures of network evolution, including expansion, shrinkage, concentration, and polarization. Furthermore, the project will investigate the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development, focusing on the evolution of port cities and their hinterlands, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. This will be achieved through the integration of global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions. The outcomes will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development, contributing to both academic research and policy-making."
