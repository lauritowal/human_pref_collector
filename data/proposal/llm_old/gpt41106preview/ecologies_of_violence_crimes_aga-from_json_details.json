        "Abstract:\n\nThe interdisciplinary research project, \"Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination,\" aims to pioneer an innovative ecological model for analyzing violence and its representations, with a focus on environmental violence or \"ecoviolence.\" The project's core objectives include developing a theoretical framework that documents and analyzes how cultural expressions represent ecoviolence, and examines the intricate links between ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide. It further seeks to dissect the reflections on guilt, responsibility, and the cultural implications of violence, while exploring the affective dimensions that cultural representations employ to relate and critically reflect on environmental crises.\n\nEmploying a comparative and transnational analysis, the project integrates cultural memory studies with ecocriticism to reorient these fields towards a more-than-human perspective. The methodology is set to foster critical literacies about ecoviolence, enabling a deeper understanding of the themes of environmental violence, cultural memory, and representation of violence.\n\nThe expected outputs of this research include a comprehensive study that maps the representation of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for pedagogical engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence. The project, thus, not only contributes to academic discourse but also to educational practices, encouraging a nuanced and critical approach to understanding the complexities of ecoviolence in the contemporary era.\n\nThe project, titled \"EcoViolence,\" is designed to provide a novel framework for thinking about violence and memory in terms that extend beyond the human experience, prompting a reevaluation of our relationship with the environment and the ways in which this relationship is mediated through culture. This research holds the potential to transform the cultural imagination and foster a more responsible and ethical engagement with the world we inhabit."
