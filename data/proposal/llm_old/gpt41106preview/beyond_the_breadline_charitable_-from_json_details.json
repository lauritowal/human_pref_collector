        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Beyond the breadline: Charitable food provision and survival strategies of the urban poor in a comparative perspective\" addresses the critical role of charitable food provision (CFP) as a lifeline for those facing food insecurity and hunger. In the wake of the Great Recession, the significance of CFP has escalated, not only as a means of immediate support but also as a component in the transition towards more sustainable food surplus utilization and waste reduction. This project emerges in response to a pressing need to understand the evolving landscape of CFP, particularly given the backdrop of diminishing welfare benefits and societal shifts.\n\nDespite the importance of CFP, research to date lacks a robust framework for international comparison, often neglecting the broader context of welfare regimes and civil society's role. Furthermore, the influence of sustainability transitions within the agri-food sector on CFP remains underexplored. To address these gaps, this project aims to: 1) trace the historical progress of CFP in three distinct countries—Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands; 2) delve into the dynamics of CFP in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam; 3) explore the interplay between food insecurity and support systems; 4) develop and deploy a novel tool for real-time data collection in city workshops; and 5) establish a comprehensive framework for international CFP comparison.\n\nEmploying a blend of event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, the study will focus on the professionalization of CFP sectors, the operational modes and interrelationships of providers, and their connections with state and non-state entities. The proposed innovative data collection tool will bolster the investigation in city workshops.\n\nAnticipated impacts of this research include the generation of new interdisciplinary knowledge and the provision of comparative insights into food support mechanisms and insecurity, with the potential to extend the comparative framework to additional countries and cities. This research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of CFP’s role in the survival strategies of the urban poor, offering valuable data for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars."
