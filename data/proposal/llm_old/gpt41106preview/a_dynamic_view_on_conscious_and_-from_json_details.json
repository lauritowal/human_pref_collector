        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nThe proposed project aims to unravel the intricate distinction between conscious and unconscious processes, a pivotal challenge in comprehending the complexities of the human mind. By applying a combination of behavioral and brain imaging methods, this study will advance our understanding of these cognitive phenomena and their respective influences on human behavior.\n\nThe research is organized into three distinct tracks. Track 1 investigates unconscious perception using Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and stimuli sequences, illuminating the nature of subliminal influences. Track 2 addresses conscious perception through a Bayesian framework, striving to reconstruct perceptual contents and clarify the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions. Finally, Track 3 explores the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants, employing psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG to discern whether consciousness development is attributable to the maturation of posterior or anterior brain regions.\n\nThe expected impacts of this project are manifold. Firstly, it will provide evidence regarding the existence of sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, expanding current knowledge on how unconscious processes affect cognition. Secondly, it will specify cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions, thereby enhancing our conceptual models of conscious perception. Lastly, the research will offer groundbreaking insights into the development of consciousness in humans, potentially identifying critical developmental stages and contributing to the field of developmental psychology.\n\nThis proposal represents an ambitious and innovative approach to dissecting the layers of conscious and unconscious processing. By integrating cutting-edge techniques and methodologies, it stands to make significant contributions to the scientific community's understanding of these fundamental aspects of human cognition, with implications for both theoretical frameworks and practical applications."
