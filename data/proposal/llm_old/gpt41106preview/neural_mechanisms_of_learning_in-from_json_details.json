        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious project aimed at unraveling the neural underpinnings of learning in the infant brain, a critical period when the human cerebral architecture begins to engage with a rich symbolic system. The project will focus on infants, starting from 6 months of gestation and continuing through the end of the first year of life, to investigate how they acquire language and navigate complex social interactions.\n\nThe research is structured into six work packages (WPs), each designed to probe a different aspect of infant learning. WP1 will examine how infants of different ages can make statistical inferences using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms. WP2 will explore the consequences of various pre-term environments on early statistical computations. WP3 is dedicated to identifying the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, while WP4 will establish criteria for infant symbolic competency. WP5 aims to pinpoint functional localization and maturational markers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, WP6 will focus on the development of new tools for multimodal brain image analysis.\n\nThe methodologies employed will include electroencephalography (EEG), MRI, and optical topography, integrating these techniques to provide a comprehensive picture of the learning processes in the developing brain. The outcomes of this research will elucidate the specificities of neural functional architecture critical for human learning and pave the way for interventions that could assist infants at risk of developmental delays.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to bridge the gap between the fundamental neuroscientific understanding of learning and the practical applications that can benefit early human development, setting the stage for future educational strategies and cognitive support mechanisms."
