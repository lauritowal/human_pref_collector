        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence,\" addresses the escalating challenges of violent extremism within the context of the UN Decade of Action (2020-2030). Recognizing the critical importance of fighting violent extremism, this project aims to overcome substantial theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings that currently hinder our understanding and intervention capabilities.\n\nThe theoretical gap, marked by a poor consensus on the nature and causes of radicalization, will be addressed by developing a comprehensive multi-theory model through Work Package 1 (WP1). Empirical challenges, such as infrequent access to populations of interest, will be tackled by creating an innovative data collection methodology in WP2. Methodological limitations, including the inability to test for causality and an over-reliance on qualitative data, will be countered by implementing a series of comparative studies and experiments in WP3. This work will examine mechanisms of radicalization both inside and outside prison environments across 10 diverse nations: Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan.\n\nThe project's contributions are twofold. First, it will collect unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders worldwide, thus significantly enhancing scientific understanding. Second, it will provide novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism, culminating in the development of prevention programs in WP4.\n\nThis multi-theory, multi-method approach promises to yield transformative insights, facilitating the creation of targeted interventions to pre-empt and reduce the risk of radicalization leading to violence. By bridging the gaps in current research, the project will contribute substantially to global prevention strategies, aligning with the priorities of the UN Decade of Action."
