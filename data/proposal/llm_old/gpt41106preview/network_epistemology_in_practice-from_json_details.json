        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Network Epistemology in Practice\" project represents an ambitious inquiry into the history and philosophy of science, with a particular focus on the collaborative dynamics of particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). This project seeks to unravel the intricate web of knowledge generation and validation within the vast network of scientists at CERN. It will employ advanced digital humanities tools to meticulously analyze and characterize collective research processes by systematically reconstructing internal communication from born-digital documents, such as emails and internal wiki pages.\n\nThe core objectives of the research are multifaceted. First, it aims to understand how large scientific collaborations foster knowledge creation, and how this knowledge is subsequently authenticated and disseminated. Second, the project will develop historiographic guidelines tailored to future studies that rely on born-digital sources, establishing a new standard in the field. In addition, it will contribute significantly to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation by adapting and testing theoretical models of network epistemology in a real-world context.\n\nThis research is poised to make groundbreaking contributions, offering not only historiographic guidelines for handling studies based on born-digital sources but also providing practical strategies to inform best practices in the history and philosophy of science. The methodological innovations at the heart of this proposal include the application of digital tools and computational methods designed to manage and interpret the vast amounts of data inherent to large-scale scientific collaborations.\n\nBy addressing the complex challenge of capturing and analyzing large-scale, intricate research processes for epistemological analysis, this project stands to advance our understanding of the social and intellectual mechanisms that drive collective scientific endeavors. Its findings will have significant implications for both historical inquiry and the philosophy of science, particularly in the context of large, interdisciplinary research teams."
