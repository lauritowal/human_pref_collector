        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules for Ecosystem Service Mapping\n\nThe SCALEFORES project aims to refine the approach to ecosystem service mapping by developing a novel methodological framework that leverages existing data to elucidate relationships between multiple ecosystem services. The primary objectives are to overcome the current limitations in reliably mapping these interrelationships and to foster an ecosystem service-based management of landscapes that is multifunctional and sustainable.\n\nOur approach is to systematically examine the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and the social and ecological variables that underpin them. By doing so, we intend to generate new insights into how these services co-vary across different spatial scales. The project also plans to produce detailed maps that highlight the trade-offs and synergies (win-wins) between various ecosystem services. These maps will be validated against the most comprehensive existing data sets on ecosystem services within Europe, ensuring the robustness of our methodology.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of SCALEFORES include the creation of accurate maps that represent the intricate relationships between ecosystem services, thereby significantly enhancing the capacity for mapping the distribution of these services. The data sources for this project encompass land cover, soil type, and human population density, which are crucial determinants of ecosystem function and service provision.\n\nThe justification for focusing on Europe lies in its standing as the region with the most extensive and reliable data on ecosystem services globally. This provides an unparalleled opportunity for rigorous testing and application of our framework.\n\nSCALEFORES promises to be a transformative step in ecosystem service research and management, offering tangible benefits for policy-making, conservation planning, and sustainable development. The project's success will set a precedent for similar initiatives worldwide, aiming to better understand and manage the natural capital upon which we all depend."
