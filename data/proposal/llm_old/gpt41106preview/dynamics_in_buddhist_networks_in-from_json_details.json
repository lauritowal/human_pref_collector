        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries,\" which aims to create a groundbreaking framework for understanding the complex phenomena of cultural encounter and religious transfer during a pivotal era in the history of Eastern Central Asia. The project's central objective is to elucidate the intricate interplay between various cultures and the propagation of Buddhism from the 6th to the 14th centuriesâ€”a period of profound religious and cultural transformations.\n\nThe research will employ a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, using a novel methodology that includes the reconstruction of Buddhist networks to gain a comprehensive understanding of the region's religious dynamics. The study will draw from an array of research fields including Philology, Art History, Archaeology, and Religious Studies, providing a multi-faceted analysis that transcends traditional academic boundaries.\n\nThe unique perspective of this proposal lies in its approach to analyzing religious exchange as a dynamic network that evolves over time and across different spatial contexts. By examining the multi-layered relationships between Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan cultures, the project will illuminate the processes through which Buddhism was localized in Eastern Central Asia and its broader implications for Comparative Religious Studies.\n\nThe project promises to deliver a comprehensive description of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism's localizations, filling a significant gap in our current understanding of the region's cultural and religious history. As such, this cutting-edge research has the potential to redefine the scholarly narrative of Buddhist expansion and adaptation, providing invaluable insights into the historical interconnectivity of Eurasian civilizations."
