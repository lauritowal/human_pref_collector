It will be the first study to survey the cultural landscape of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany in any detail. By doing so it will offer a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, in particular in three areas: the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany; the history of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature (arguing the two were more intertwined than has previously been suggested); and the history of the relationship between postwar and Cold War. Combining Anglo-American and German literature and film history with critical analysis, cultural history and life-writing, this is a necessarily ambitious, multidisciplinary study which will open up a major new field of research."
