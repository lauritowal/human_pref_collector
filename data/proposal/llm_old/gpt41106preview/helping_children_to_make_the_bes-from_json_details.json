        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\n\nThe transition to high school is a critical stage for young adolescents, often marked by challenges such as peer rejection, victimization, and strained relations with teachers, which can adversely impact their self-regulation and stress-management abilities. Addressing these issues, the ERC-team under the ERC consolidator grant for Social-Bio Interplay proposes the development and assessment of an innovative intervention toolâ€”the A.L.I.B.I. serious game. \n\nA.L.I.B.I. is designed as a virtual high school environment where players are tasked with uncovering an alien disguised as a teacher or peer. This engaging narrative serves as a backdrop for players to practice prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and to consider multiple response options with a focus on long-term consequences. By allowing rehearsal of prosocial behaviors in a realistic yet safe learning environment, A.L.I.B.I. aims to facilitate smoother school transitions for children.\n\nThe project's goals are fourfold: to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a fully functional stand-alone game; to rigorously assess its effectiveness in improving transition experiences; to integrate the game into existing school transition training programs; and to develop a marketing strategy for widespread implementation across The Netherlands and eventually Europe. The game promises to appeal to children through the use of captivating game elements and accessibility via tablet computers.\n\nThe project will collaborate with three school counseling organizations to implement the intervention in three regions in The Netherlands, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of its impact and scalability. Through the innovative use of serious gaming, this project seeks to address a pressing educational need, providing adolescents with the skills necessary to navigate the social complexities of high school and promoting their overall well-being.\n\nKeywords: Transition to high school, serious game, prosocial behavior, self-regulation, stress-management, peer relations, adolescent well-being."
