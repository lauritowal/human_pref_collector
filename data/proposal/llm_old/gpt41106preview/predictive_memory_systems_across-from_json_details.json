        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan,\" aims to delve into the complexities of the brain as a prediction machine, focusing on internal models that forecast future states. This research will explore the fundamental nature of predictive processes and how they are influenced by the brain's structural and functional integrity, particularly in the context of memory systems. The project is anchored in the predictive coding framework and seeks to advance our understanding of neurocognitive architectures involved in predictive processing.\n\nOur study will address two key empirical questions: the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, and the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity caused by maturation and senescence. To achieve this, we will integrate predictive coding with memory systems research, considering the full spectrum of human development by including children, younger adults, and older adults in our study population. We plan to investigate both episodic and semantic memory, examining these systems through the lenses of progression in development and the conservation of function over time.\n\nOur research methodology will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe the neurocognitive factors in play, specifically the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits in varying age groups. By doing so, we aim to gain insights into the role of predictive processing throughout the lifespan.\n\nThe potential impact of our research includes the formulation of a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle, which may illuminate the emergence of disorders at different life stages. Ultimately, PIVOTAL (Predictive Internal Models Over The Lifespan) will significantly contribute to the scientific community's understanding of how the brain predicts and prepares for future events, improving our comprehension of cognitive development and aging."
