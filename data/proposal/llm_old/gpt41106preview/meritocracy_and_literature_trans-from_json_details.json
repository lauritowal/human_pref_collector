        "Abstract:\n\nThe MERLIT project represents a pioneering research initiative aimed at systematically exploring the nuanced portrayals of meritocracy within literary texts across various cultural landscapes and historical periods. This project, entitled \"Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms,\" seeks to examine the complex interactions between literature and meritocratic ideals, which have long been enmeshed with structures of domination and privilege. Despite the global relevance of these narratives, there is a striking research gap in the scholarly investigation into their formal principles and a tendency to concentrate on Western contexts and contemporary literature.\n\nMERLIT will undertake a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation that broadens the scope to include both Western and non-Western (Global South and transcultural anglophone) contexts, thereby providing a more comprehensive and inclusive analysis. The project will scrutinize literary practices from the 17th century to the present, with an aim to expand our understanding of how meritocratic articulations and critiques are shaped through writing.\n\nWith six distinct work packages, MERLIT integrates interdisciplinary fields such as literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation. The objectives are threefold: to explore the literary practices that have shaped the articulation of meritocratic thought, to expand the contextual focus to include underrepresented literary traditions, and to engage with historical and contemporary forms of meritocracy. By doing so, MERLIT aims to offer a robust literary history of meritocratic thought that advances our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing and highlights literature's worldmaking role.\n\nMERLIT's groundbreaking research initiative promises to fill existing research gaps and contribute significantly to the academic conversation about meritocracy in literature. The project will not only provide a fresh perspective on literary meritocratic narratives but will also reveal how these narratives have been instrumental in shaping and challenging cultural and societal norms across diverse contexts."
