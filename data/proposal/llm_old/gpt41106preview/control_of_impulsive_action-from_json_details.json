        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Control of Impulsive Action\" focuses on a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms governing impulsive behavior, aiming to advance our understanding of how individuals regulate such behaviors and the resulting implications for society. The research will address critical questions on the emergence of impulsive actions during the task-preparation phase, the influence of negative emotions, the impact of learning on impulsivity, the functionality of impulsive actions, and the correlation between state and trait impulsivity.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach combining behavioral paradigms, cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience techniques such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), physiological measures including facial Electromyography (EMG), and sophisticated mathematical modelling of decision-making processes, the project aims to achieve several key objectives. These include pinpointing the genesis and regulation of impulsive actions, challenging and refining the prevailing inhibitory control models with comprehensive multifaceted models, elucidating the spatial and temporal aspects of impulsivity and control, and crafting an innovative behavioral model of impulsive action.\n\nMoreover, the research seeks to comprehend the roots of individual differences in impulsivity and to explore the nature of disorders characterized by deficits in impulse control. This project promises to provide significant contributions to the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and mental health by enhancing our understanding of impulsivity, offering a foundation for the development of interventions to improve impulse control and addressing problems that stem from such behavioral issues.\n\n(Word count: 223)"
