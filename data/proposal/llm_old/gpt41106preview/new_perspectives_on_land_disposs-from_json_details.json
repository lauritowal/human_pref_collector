        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\n\nThe West African Sahel region, characterized by its complex socio-political dynamics and environmental challenges, has witnessed a surge in land dispossession, contributing to social unrest and mass migrations. This project, titled \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel,\" aims to delve into these pressing issues with Mali as a case study. Targeting both farmers and pastoralists, the project addresses the central issue of land dispossession and tests the hypotheses that dispossessed smallholders are more prone to either migrate or engage in violent resistance, and that such resistance is intricately tied to the emergence of 'jihadist' groups.\n\nThe objectives are twofold: first, to investigate the link between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration; and second, to assess the reasons behind the varying reactions of smallholders to dispossessionâ€”some choosing violence while others comply. Employing mixed methods in our research allows for a comprehensive analysis of these phenomena.\n\nThe theoretical frameworks guiding this study include political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies. These frameworks will help us to understand the intricate layers of socio-political and environmental factors affecting land governance.\n\nWe anticipate that the project will yield novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, enhance our understanding of the interplay between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and ultimately generate ideas beneficial for policy formulation. The project promises to furnish stakeholders, including policymakers and civil society organizations, with new perspectives to address the challenges of land dispossession and its cascading effects in the West African Sahel."
