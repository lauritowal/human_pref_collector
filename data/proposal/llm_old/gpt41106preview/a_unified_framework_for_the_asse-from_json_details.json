        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models,\" addresses the critical challenges in the field of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, marked by the proliferation of cognitive models and their varied idiosyncratic applications. Our project aims to streamline the assessment and application of cognitive models, setting a new standard for methodological rigor and reproducibility.\n\nCognitive models, such as drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models, have provided substantial insights into the mechanisms of decision making and learning. However, with the rapid expansion of cognitive modeling techniques, researchers are often at a loss about the state-of-the-art practices and the best methods to apply these models to experimental data. Our project seeks to develop a unified program that uses Bayesian inference as its foundation to tackle these issues. Through the assessment of both absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, and the exploration of efficient algorithms for parameter estimation, we aim to enhance the quality and consistency of cognitive model applications.\n\nA key innovation of our project is the construction of plausible parameter priors and the development of diagnostic experiments that will allow for more precise model comparisons using Bayes factors, especially in hierarchical designs. The result is a model-averaged assessment of parameter changes that can guide interpretations of cognitive processes across a variety of experimental paradigms.\n\nThe practical relevance of our work is underscored by the plan to incorporate our techniques into the JASP software (jasp-stats.org), a free and open-source platform widely used by students, researchers, and practitioners. This integration will facilitate the dissemination and adoption of our framework, providing the scientific community with robust and accessible tools for cognitive model assessment and application.\n\nUltimately, our project promises to resolve current methodological uncertainties and promote more transparent, reproducible, and accurate cognitive modeling practices, benefiting a wide range of disciplines and applications in cognitive science."
