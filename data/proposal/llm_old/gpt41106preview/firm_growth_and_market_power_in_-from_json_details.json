        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\" project seeks to advance our understanding of the determinants of firm growth and the nature of market power within the context of an increasingly interconnected global economy. Stemming from the motivation provided by EC 2007, this research aims to dissect the complex relationship between globalization, trade, and industrial policy, and its implications for economic welfare and policymaking. \n\nOur research objectives are underpinned by an innovative approach that integrates richer firm behavior into models of international trade, offering a nuanced perspective on the influence of trade and industrial policies on growth trajectories, particularly in less developed markets. We will explore pivotal research questions such as the role of trade and competition policy in ensuring consumer benefits from globalization, the effects of domestic policies on small farmers' gains from trade, the impact of industrial policies on firm growth via input linkages, and the consequences of banking globalization on firms' expansion in the real sector.\n\nThe five-year project will focus on developing economies, engaging in theoretical work augmented by rich data to provide a comprehensive analysis. Our research activities are designed to yield significant contributions to the field, expanding the knowledge frontier on trade and industrial policy, and serving as a foundation for informed policymaking. \n\nThe expected outcomes of BIGlobal include the generation of critical insights into how policy can foster a more equitable distribution of the benefits of globalization, ensuring that growth is both inclusive and sustainable. Through this research, we aim to equip policymakers with the evidence-based guidance necessary to navigate the complexities of a globalized market and to formulate strategies that maximize welfare for all stakeholders in the global economy."
