        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Global Economies of Salvation. Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\n\nThe proposed project, GLOBECOSAL, seeks to explore the intricate relationships between art, sanctity, and power in the post-Tridentine era, a time marked by religious turmoil and the expansion of Iberian empires. This ambitious research aims to globalize the history of early modern art by investigating the role of artworks in the negotiation and affirmation of spiritual status within Catholic communities, against the backdrop of the Catholic-Protestant conflict.\n\nThe project will focus on how artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints were used as tools for self-representation and social identity formation, particularly within the framework of the Roman Curia and the context of Iberian hegemony. It hypothesizes that art pieces functioned as critical instruments in the global market of symbolic values, revealing the negotiation of sanctity and the complex interplay between local constructions of sanctity and the broader Catholic recognition processes.\n\nTo achieve its aims, GLOBECOSAL will employ a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating critical sociology and art history to challenge prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. The methodology includes tracing the circulation of material objects, analyzing iconographies, and examining global networks of knowledge transmission. This will uncover the often-neglected areas of how blesseds and saints were perceived and honored in the far-reaching Iberian empires.\n\nBy elucidating the global dimensions of sanctity and the use of art in religious and political negotiations, the project aspires to contribute significantly to our understanding of the global dynamics of the early modern period. It will also provide a nuanced theoretical framework for interpreting the global market of symbolic values in the context of religious art and its purposes."
