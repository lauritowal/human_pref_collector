        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine\n\nThe contemporary medical field faces the critical challenge of wastefulness, with vast amounts of materials being discarded that could otherwise be repurposed. \"The Upcycled Clinic\" is an ambitious ethnographic project aimed at addressing this issue by exploring the creative repurposing practices within clinics around the world. This grant proposal outlines an innovative research initiative with the primary objective of understanding the conditions that foster creative material engagement in clinical settings.\n\nThe project will consist of five sub-projects, each situated in a diverse array of locations: Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K. These sites have been carefully chosen to provide a comprehensive global perspective on the improvisational use of materials in medicine. Through the participation of ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff, the project will utilize a rich blend of research methods including intensive fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and the analysis of open datasets.\n\nAiming to move hospital ethnographies beyond the traditional focus on patient encounters, this project will be the first globally orientated study to delve into the often-overlooked practices of improvisation in the clinic. It will also develop new methods for reusing and sharing research material, thus contributing to the sustainability of research practices themselves.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching. By advancing theories of materiality and addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace, \"The Upcycled Clinic\" will provide critical insights into the ways healthcare systems can foster creativity and local solutions to challenges of wastefulness and resource shortages.\n\nUpon completion, the project will articulate the conditions necessary for healthcare creativity, offering practical outcomes that can be applied across various medical contexts to combat wasteful practices and promote sustainable, innovative solutions in clinical environments."
