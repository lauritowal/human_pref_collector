        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance,\" aims to deliver a world-historically significant contribution to the understanding of China's urban governance. It tackles the complex challenges at the theoretical and policy levels by employing a multi-scalar investigation across neighbourhoods, cities, and regions. Utilizing a robust methodological framework that includes ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and collaborative engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers, the study will provide a rich, empirically grounded analysis.\n\nThe project will focus on case studies in diverse locales, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, the Jing-Jin-Ji metropolitan region, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, spanning the coastal, central, and western regions of China. This selection captures a wide spectrum of urbanization experiences and the impact of recent national strategic projects. With the backdrop of the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and ongoing trade tensions, the project’s timeliness cannot be overstated.\n\nWe aim to contribute to the theory of entrepreneurial urban governance by offering a unique perspective rooted in indigenous experiences of Chinese urban transformation. This shift in perspective is poised to revolutionize the discourse on urban governance and development.\n\nThe project will culminate in a series of six workshops and a publication series, ensuring that the findings reach a broad audience and stimulate further academic and policy-oriented discussions. The transformative potential of this research is encapsulated in its central goal: to fundamentally change how we think about China and its governance, providing a nuanced theoretical framework that explains the state's entrepreneurial approach to managing urban change."
