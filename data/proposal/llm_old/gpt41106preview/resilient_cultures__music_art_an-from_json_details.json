        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\" project aims to investigate the adaptive and resilient strategies employed by cultural practices in expressing social and political discontent under authoritarian regimes. Focusing on the vibrant fields of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, this research will offer a comparative analysis across two distinct yet interrelated regions: Mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe study will explore a diverse array of cultural fields, including indie and folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema, in prominent localities such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui. Through a methodological toolkit that combines ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research, the project seeks to understand the various expressions of resilience and cultural critique that emerge in response to platformization and censorship.\n\nThe project's network goals extend beyond China and Hong Kong, aiming to foster connections with regions in East Asia and Europe through a range of activities including workshops, a podcast series, performances, screenings, and an exhibition. These collaborative efforts will facilitate a rich exchange of ideas and experiences, contributing to a better understanding of cultural resilience in comparative contexts such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include a nuanced appreciation of multivocality, diversity, and the vitality of cultural production in the face of oppressive forces. The project, aptly named RESCUE (Resilient Cultural Expressions Under Scrutiny), will provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of cultural resilience, offering a beacon of hope and innovation in societies confronting authoritarianism. This research will ultimately enhance interdisciplinary scholarship and contribute to the global discourse on culture, resistance, and freedom of expression."
