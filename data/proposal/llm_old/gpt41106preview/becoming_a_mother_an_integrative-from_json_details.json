        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period\n\nThe proposed project aims to develop an integrative model of the physiological, cognitive, and emotional adaptations that occur in women as they transition into motherhood. By examining changes from pre-pregnancy through the postpartum period, the project seeks to establish the onset and evolution of brain changes in pregnant women, characterize the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric health, and assess the impact of environmental and psychological factors on these adaptations. Furthermore, this study intends to identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with the maternal adaptation process.\n\nEmploying a prospective longitudinal study design, the research will involve five time points: one pre-pregnancy, two during pregnancy, and two postpartum sessions, spanning over the course of the perinatal period. The study will collect a rich array of data, including neuroimaging, psychological assessments, behavioral observations, and metabolomics profiles.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from three distinct groups: nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy, and a control group of nulliparous women not experiencing pregnancy. Each group will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the motherhood adaptation process.\n\nThe deliverables of this project include a longitudinal Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-based model mapping the trajectory of maternal adaptation, intermediate evaluations following the postpartum sessions, and cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy and postpartum sessions. This integrative approach is poised to illuminate the complex interplay of biological and environmental factors shaping the journey to motherhood, with the potential to inform clinical practices and support services for new mothers."
