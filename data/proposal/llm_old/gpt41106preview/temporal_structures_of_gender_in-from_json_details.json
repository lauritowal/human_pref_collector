        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes,\" seeks to investigate the intricate dynamics between gender roles, welfare systems, and time use patterns across diverse cultural contexts. Underpinned by Esping-Andersen’s seminal framework of \"three worlds\" of welfare capitalism, the project will delve into the gendered division of unpaid work and daily activities and how these patterns contribute to social inequality. The study is particularly innovative in its comparative approach, juxtaposing East Asian societies—specifically China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—with Western societies to uncover systemic differences and similarities in the structuring of gender roles.\n\nKey concepts such as unpaid labor, life schedules, public policies, care provision, and leisure time will be explored to understand their implications for family outcomes and enjoyment of life. By employing a cross-national and historical comparative analysis, the project will utilize rich data sources, including time diary data and household panel data. These sources will provide a robust empirical basis for examining the temporal and structural aspects of gender inequality at household, societal, and life course levels.\n\nThe study aims to articulate how modern technology and evolving public policies influence the gender division of labor and the distribution of domestic labor and leisure time. By highlighting the temporal dimensions of care provision and domestic responsibilities, the project aspires to contribute to a deeper understanding of the persistence of gender inequalities within different welfare regimes. The findings are expected to offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders interested in promoting gender equality and formulating interventions that consider the temporal and cultural nuances of care and domestic work. Overall, this research will expand our knowledge of gendered time use and its connection to welfare regimes, providing a comparative lens through which to view and address the challenges of social inequality."
