Whilst trying to come to terms with recent acts of urban terrorism, governments, security agencies, and local communities are bracing themselves for further attacks. UrbTerr will offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in four European countries that have suffered particularly as a result of this wave of violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Drawing on concepts and methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory and anthropology, UrbTerr will document and analyse a range of voices in contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe and problematise the narrow concept of imagination and creativity underpinning recent counter-terrorism measures and a great part of the academic literature on this subject. It will: (1) analyse the collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining that have shaped urban spaces in the four countries after recent terrorist attacks; (2) develop a new materialist approach to terrorism and use this framework to critically assess policies and material security infrastructures that were created in response to these attacks at a local and European level; (3) use performance art as a creative tool to develop and experiment with alternative forms of remembering and different visions of the future. Outputs of the project will include a website with footage of interviews with city residents, politicians, architects, political activists, and other key actors, as well as other resources for terrorism research, two academic monographs, articles in peer-reviewed journals, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of thought-provoking public performances by the art group ‘Center for Political Beauty’ that will spark critical debates about securitization processes in contemporary Europe."
