        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans\n\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize our understanding of human evolution and migration throughout the Quaternary period, a span of 2.6 million years that witnessed significant climatic oscillations, ice sheet expansions, sea-level changes, and the re-organization of plant and animal communities. Central to this endeavor is the importance of timing; hence, we will utilize amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating to overcome the limitations of radiocarbon dating, which is restricted to the last ~60,000 years.\n\nOur focus is to develop a comprehensive chronology that is critical for interpreting the significance of human evolution, migration, and their relationship with environmental changes across Europe. Given the current limitations of dating methods, we will employ novel techniques using calcitic fossils and snail opercula, applying paired dating methods to achieve more accurate results.\n\nThe project's geographic scale encompasses various critical European regions, including Britain and the Black Sea area. It spans the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia, offering a pan-European perspective on our ancient history. Our research aims to refine the understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change over the last 2.6 million years.\n\nThe project will address critical questions regarding the timing of early human expansion into Europe, the climatic conditions that prevailed during these expansions, and the differences in tool technologies that emerged as a result. By developing a comprehensive and reliable chronology, the project promises to be a breakthrough in our ability to understand the intricate tapestry of our past, bridging the gap between human history and the environmental events that shaped it."
