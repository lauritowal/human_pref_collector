        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe,\" addresses the escalating challenge of energy poverty affecting millions of households across Eastern and Central Europe. Energy vulnerability in these regions is a multifaceted issue, exacerbated by factors such as surging energy prices, harsh climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, stark income disparities, and the ongoing economic and political restructuring.\n\nCurrent conceptualizations of energy poverty, predominantly focused on incomes and energy efficiency, fail to capture the complexity of the issue. This project seeks to transcend these limitations by investigating the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty through the lens of energy vulnerability. The research will be conducted as a comparative study across four post-socialist cities: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje, utilizing a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods.\n\nThe project aims to revolutionize the existing understanding of energy poverty by considering a broader range of social factors and spatial disparities. By situating the research in post-socialist urban settings, the project will provide insights into how historical legacies and recent transitions influence current energy vulnerabilities. The case study locations have been carefully selected to encompass a diverse range of socio-economic and energy supply contexts, ensuring the findings have broader relevance for similar urban areas undergoing transformation.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of the project include the improvement of technical and institutional frameworks to combat energy poverty, the provision of more affordable energy services to vulnerable populations, and contributions to climate change mitigation efforts. By exploring and elucidating the complexities of energy vulnerability, this project will furnish policymakers and stakeholders with the necessary knowledge to formulate effective, nuanced responses to energy poverty in urban Europe."
