        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health,\" seeks to undertake a comprehensive socio-historical study examining the evolution of health governance from the post-World War II era to the emergence of the current regime in the 1980s. This research will delve into the critical transition between two distinct regimes of knowledge and action within the realm of health governance. The study aims to uncover the underpinnings of this shift, focusing on the changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO), the development of health governance in non-Western countries with a specific emphasis on India, and the transformation of health challenges such as Tuberculosis, Mental health, Traditional medicine, and Medical genetics.\n\nEmploying historical and anthropological investigation methodologies, the project will explore the incorporation of diverse social worlds, including laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations into the understanding of global health. It will emphasize how global health is translated and emerges from local practices and knowledge, challenging traditional views of knowledge circulation that predominantly highlight North-South transfers. The project seeks to elucidate the complex dynamics that facilitated the transition from a Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal, multi-centric age characterized by uncertainty.\n\nThe expected benefits of this research are multifold. It will provide a nuanced understanding of global health as a field influenced by both local and international actors and forces. Moreover, the study aims to bring to light the different levels of knowledge circulation and the role of various stakeholders in shaping health policies. By examining this historical transition, the project will contribute to contemporary discussions on global health governance, offering valuable insights into the management of chronic diseases, the impact of market-driven regulations, and the nature of private-public alliances.\n\nIn summary, this investigation into the postwar government of health promises to enhance our understanding of the shift from international to global health governance and its implications for current and future health policy and practice."
