        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature,\" proposes an innovative reexamination of world literature through the prisms of multilingualism and geographical significance, challenging the monolingual and Anglo-centric paradigms that currently dominate the field. Recognizing that literature from non-Western regions, such as north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, is often marginalized unless translated into English and circulated globally, this study seeks to redefine what constitutes world literature by acknowledging and analyzing the rich, localized multilingual practices that exist within these regions.\n\nThe project focuses on key periods, including times of imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment, to unpack how multilingual locals and significant geographies interact with and against the forces shaping world literature. By exploring local transculturations, debates on world literature, forms of multilingualism, and the actors and technologies of print and orality, the project aims to reveal the complex dynamics of appropriation, co-constitution, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories that inform literary production and reception.\n\nCentral to the project's approach are the concepts of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions, which are used to critique the \"monolingual straitjacket\" and the partitioned modern literary histories. The study's multilingual and located approach will provide a new theoretical framework and methods for multilingual training and research, fostering strategic dialogues among scholars in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France.\n\nBy advocating for a more inclusive definition of world literature, the project aims to ensure that non-circulating literature, regardless of its global presence, is given its due recognition. The outcome will not only enrich the understanding of world literature but will also contribute to the development of innovative educational and research strategies that embrace linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\n(Word count: 279)"
