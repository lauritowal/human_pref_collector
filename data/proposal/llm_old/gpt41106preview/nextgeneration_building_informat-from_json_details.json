        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Next-Generation Building Information Modeling to Support Evaluation of Human Behavior in Built Environments\n\nThe current state of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is notably limited by its inadequate depiction of buildings, with an overemphasis on physical and material characteristics while neglecting user context, intended use, and consideration of occupants. These constraints result in a profound inability to forecast the impacts of buildings on future users' lives and activities, leading to insufficient assessments of whether structures meet their intended users' needs. In light of these challenges, our project aims to revolutionize BIM by developing a comprehensive modeling method that transcends traditional evaluations based solely on physical aspects like lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability.\n\nOur research will introduce a paradigm shift by incorporating form, function, and use information within building models, thereby significantly improving the predictive capabilities regarding occupant behavior and interaction. The proposed research is grounded in the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth and argues for advanced BIM systems that encompass user behavior and contextual factors for superior building design.\n\nThe anticipated benefits of this research are multi-fold. By achieving a more holistic representation of built spaces, we can design better buildings that are not only structurally sound and energy-efficient but also conducive to the well-being and productivity of the occupants. Enhanced predictive models for user behavior would allow architects, designers, and planners to create environments that are more aligned with human needs, fostering positive interactions and experiences.\n\nThis initiative has the potential to set a new benchmark for BIM and pave the way for future research and development in architectural design, urban planning, and sustainable development. The grant support would enable us to undertake this transformative work, with the ultimate goal of creating built environments that truly serve their inhabitants."
