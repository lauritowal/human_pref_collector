        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal aims to fund the project titled \"Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training,\" designed to advance our understanding of the brain's adaptation to acute stress and to develop innovative methods for enhancing stress resilience. The project's impact is threefold: it will provide deep insight into the adaptation of brain networks to acute stress, identify transdiagnostic biomarkers for differentiating individuals resilient to stress from those sensitive to it, and create a novel method for training individuals to become more resilient to stress.\n\nCentral to the proposal is the hypothesis that acute stress induces dynamic shifts in resources among large-scale neural networks, which affects higher-order cognitive functions. The objectives of this project are to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of these network shifts during and after acute stress events, to identify neural markers that predict resilience using a combination of biosensors and mobile apps, to validate these markers in a group of patients with high stress sensitivity, to examine the influence of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in the rapid shifts of neural network balance, to assess how these shifts disrupt cognitive functions, and finally, to develop functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback protocols to train adaptive reallocation of neural resources.\n\nThe research approaches encompass advanced network connectivity modeling, the use of wearable biosensors for real-time data collection, mobile applications for monitoring and delivering interventions, and fMRI neurofeedback to facilitate targeted brain training. This project targets large-scale neural systems involved in higher-order cognition, offering a novel framework for understanding the alterations in neural systems due to acute stress as shifts in network balance.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include a greater understanding of neurobiological mechanisms of stress resilience, the development of practical biomarkers for clinical assessment, and the establishment of an evidence-based training program for stress resilience, which could have significant implications for mental health treatment and preventive care."
