        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\" seeks to explore a fundamental question in human evolution: the mechanisms by which Pliocene hominins adapted to and thrived in varied environments, specifically during their dispersal to southern Africa. Previous research indicates hominin presence in southern Africa (SA) from as early as 3.7 million years ago (Ma), with initial dispersals during the Pleistocene from higher latitudes. This interdisciplinary study will delve into the geomorphological and palaeoecological changes that may have influenced hominin movements, employing dynamic palaeo-precipitation and palaeo-vegetation models to reconstruct ancient environments. The project will also conduct anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of fossils to assess physical adaptations, alongside appraisals of species diversity and geneflow to understand the genetic implications of dispersal events.\n\nThe research is structured around three key hypotheses spanning different time periods. For the period before 2.6 Ma, the project posits that East African hominin range expansion and contraction correlated with wet and dry phases, potentially leading to reproductive isolation of southernmost populations. Descendants of these populations may include Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis. Around 2.6â€“1.5 Ma, glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere may have intermittently closed and opened dispersal corridors, allowing for sporadic hybridization between East African and southern African hominins. Finally, after 1.5 Ma, the project suggests that tectonic and hydrographic changes, particularly the Zambezi River, acted as a barrier promoting endemism and leading to distinct ecological niches in southern Africa.\n\nThis ambitious project integrates multiple disciplines to assess whether hominin dispersal to southern Africa was a matter of ecological opportunity or simply a byproduct of broader environmental and climatic shifts. The outcomes of this research are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of early human adaptability and migration patterns, with broader implications for the study of human origins and diversity."
