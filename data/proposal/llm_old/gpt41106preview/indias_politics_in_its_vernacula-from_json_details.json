        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\" aims to illuminate the conceptual underpinnings of political life in the world's largest democracy, a subject that remains largely unexplored. Despite India's significance as a rising global power, there is a considerable knowledge gap regarding the ideas that guide the political engagement of its ordinary citizens. Focusing on this lacuna, the project will employ ethnographic and historical scrutiny, tapping into the rich tapestry of India's vernacular languages.\n\nThe methodology is inherently collaborative, involving anthropologists, historians, linguists, and political scholars. Together, this interdisciplinary team will lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life. The project is inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte tradition, which investigates the historical and contextual evolution of political concepts, as seen in German political thought.\n\nThe primary objectives include the creation of an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages. This digital platform will analyze and catalogue the political vocabulary found in India's vernacular languages, making the data accessible for worldwide scholarly engagement. Additionally, the project seeks to engage with European scholars of political ideas to explore the broader implications for global political theory.\n\nAnticipated impacts of the project are manifold. It will enrich the study of subcontinental politics by providing methodological insights that reach beyond the confines of European experiences. Moreover, the project promises to contribute analytical advances towards a more inclusive global political theory that accounts for non-Western perspectives.\n\nIn essence, \"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\" will offer a pioneering examination of India's demotic political ideas and contribute significantly to the understanding of political engagement in diverse societies."
