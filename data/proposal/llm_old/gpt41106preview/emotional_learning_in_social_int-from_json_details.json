        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\n\nThe proposed project, \"Emotional Learning in Social Interaction,\" aims to elucidate the neural and psychological mechanisms underpinning how individuals learn to associate aversion with others, observe such learning in their social peers, and experience it within direct interactions. The research will focus on unraveling the processes through which individuals internalize negative biases based on ethnic group belonging and emotional expressiveness, and how moral and social status, as well as empathy and mental state attributions, influence these learning experiences. To achieve these objectives, the project will employ a range of methods, including experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, and the use of manipulated virtual environments, in conjunction with cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics approaches.\n\nThe project's innovation lies in its identification of the specific neural networks associated with social-emotional learning, including affective, associative, social cognitive, and a novel fourth network that governs learning through interaction and the shaping of behavioral norms. Through this investigation, the research aims to build and test a comprehensive neural model of social-emotional learning, contributing to a deeper understanding of human social cognition.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are significant, offering profound insights into the factors contributing to group conflicts and norm compliance, and enhancing our understanding of various psychological conditions, such as social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy, that are characterized by atypical social interaction patterns. Ultimately, this research will lay the groundwork for developing interventions and educational programs to promote positive social interactions and reduce the prevalence and impact of social biases and aversions."
