        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers’ Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe\n\nThe proposed research project aims to address the critical issues plaguing the teaching profession in Europe, namely low attractiveness, fragmentation, and widespread teacher shortages. This systematic comparative study will focus on Belgium, France, and England, with the objective of elucidating the nature of teacher policies, the changing status of the teaching profession, the dynamics of teacher allocation, and modeling and predicting trends in teacher attrition and migration.\n\nEmploying a post-comparative mixed-method design, the project will be organized into four work packages—teacher policy, supply, labour markets, and mobility. The methodology includes an array of rigorous approaches: policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, multilevel multi-group analyses, and semi-structured interviews. By analyzing both national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility, this research will provide comprehensive insights into the decisions and trajectories of participant groups such as non-entrants and early leavers in the teaching field.\n\nThe anticipated output of the project is two-fold: the generation of new theoretical knowledge and the reconceptualization of institutional change within the teaching profession. By offering a granular understanding of the cultural and institutional factors that shape teachers' careers, the study promises to inform policy-makers, educational stakeholders, and the broader academic community. Ultimately, the findings will foster an environment where the teaching profession can thrive, thereby promoting educational systems that are both resilient and effective in the face of ongoing challenges."
