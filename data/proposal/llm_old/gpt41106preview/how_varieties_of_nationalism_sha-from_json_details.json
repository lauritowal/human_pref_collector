        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\n\nIn the current political climate of advanced democracies, polarization has become a pressing concern. The proposed project aims to examine the role of nationalism in exacerbating or mitigating this divide. While extant literature often emphasizes a transnational cleavage rooted in cultural conflict, our research introduces an innovative perspective by considering different forms of nationalism and their impact on electoral politics.\n\nObjectives: This study seeks to understand how public perceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions and to evaluate whether national identities have the potential to unite disparate political groups. By scrutinizing both public and elite perspectives, the research will offer a comprehensive view of the interplay between nationalism and political polarization.\n\nResearch Framework & Theoretical Approach: A multi-method comparative research design will serve as the backbone of the investigation, enabling a nuanced analysis of complex political phenomena.\n\nWork Packages:\n- Package 1 will analyze novel survey data with open-ended questions to discern how citizens conceptualize nationalism and how these perceptions align with party lines.\n- Package 2 will scrutinize elite mobilization strategies, focusing on the deployment of diverse nationalistic narratives.\n- Package 3 will assess the influence of elite appeals to national identity on public opinion and the intensity of partisan hostility.\n\nExpected Contributions: The project is anticipated to make significant contributions to academic research by enhancing our understanding of nationalism's role in political polarization. It will also enrich public debate by shedding light on societal challenges and the potential for national identities to serve as a unifying force.\n\nThe grant support sought will enable a thorough exploration of this timely issue, with implications for both democratic theory and practice."
