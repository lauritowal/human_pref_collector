        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption\" (OLFLINK) aims to revolutionize the way we understand and influence human dietary choices. With the ultimate goal of altering human diets for improved global health and sustainability, OLFLINK addresses the significant challenge of overcoming ingrained preferences for familiar food flavors. The project posits that odor-taste associative learning is central to flavor preference formation, and seeks to fill a crucial knowledge gap concerning the cortical processes of appetitive property transfer from odor.\n\nThrough a multi-tiered investigation, OLFLINK will explore fundamental questions related to the acquisition of new flavor preferences and the influence of digestive tract signals on these preferences. The research will unfold across three objectives: CODE, which aims to determine the distributed neural code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations; CONTROL, which will delineate the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of these associations; and REGULATE, which will establish how digestive feedback interacts with the coding system during the acquisition and retrieval of flavor preferences.\n\nOLFLINK promises to have a profound impact on several fronts. By enabling the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, the project will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. This groundbreaking research holds the potential for developing novel interventions that can facilitate dietary changes over the life course.\n\nThe project's innovative approach will unite processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth, investigating levels that are typically studied in isolation. The insights gained from OLFLINK will provide a foundation for strategies to promote healthier eating habits, thereby contributing to the global effort to combat diet-related health issues and environmental concerns."
