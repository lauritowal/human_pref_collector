        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"The Design, Creation, and Survival of Democratic Laws\" (DEMOLAW), seeks funding to embark on a comprehensive study that aims to dissect and understand the intricate processes behind the formulation and endurance of legislative texts within democratic systems, particularly in the US, UK, and EU. The project's central objectives are to perform a detailed analysis of legislative documents and to answer three pivotal research questions: What are the conceptual dimensions that capture the essence of a law's design? Why is there variability in the design of democratic legislation across different systems? And what factors contribute to the stability or the evolution of laws over time?\n\nTo achieve these objectives, DEMOLAW will leverage state-of-the-art computational methods, providing a blend of quantitative rigor and qualitative insights. The project will introduce a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design and will propose an integrated theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms of legislation creation and survival. This innovative approach is anticipated to yield significant methodological advancements for the computational analysis of legislative content, setting a new standard in legislative studies.\n\nThe research will concentrate on two analytical dimensions—versatility and precision—to capture the multifaceted nature of legislative design. By examining these attributes across the political systems of the US, UK, and EU, DEMOLAW will offer a comparative perspective that highlights both commonalities and divergences in legislative approaches.\n\nThe contributions of the DEMOLAW project are poised to be far-reaching, enhancing academic understanding as well as informing policymakers about the factors that contribute to the resilience and adaptability of democratic laws. By doing so, the project aims to support the development of robust legislative frameworks that can withstand the test of time and serve the needs of democratic societies effectively."
