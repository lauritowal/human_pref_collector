        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Managing Performative Science (MAPS)\n\nThe MAPS project is a multidisciplinary initiative poised to address the increasingly recognized phenomenon of performativity within scientific disciplines. Performativity in science, where scientific predictions and explanations influence the very phenomena they aim to predict, has profound implications for both the philosophy of science and practical applications in fields such as economics, epidemiology, and machine learning. This project seeks to develop a novel understanding of performativity by exploring its mechanisms, its ethical dimensions, and by proposing a framework for its management.\n\nThe specific focus areas of MAPS include investigating the performativity in scientific practice, scrutinizing the impact of scientific predictions and explanations, and addressing the ethical questions that arise when science shapes its subject matter. The research will span across various subjects, bringing together insights from economics, where market predictions can alter financial behaviors; epidemiology, where predictions can influence disease spread patterns; and machine learning, where algorithms can shape the social and physical realities they analyze.\n\nThe primary aims of the project are threefold: first, to develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the study of performativity in science; second, to critically assess the ethical risks associated with performative effects; and third, to provide orientation for the assessment and management of performative science. By achieving these aims, MAPS will bridge the gap in philosophical guidance on the responsible conduct of scientific research that has performative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed project promises to shed light on the complex relationship between scientific inquiry and the materialization of scientific knowledge, ultimately guiding scientists, policymakers, and society in navigating and managing the performative aspects of science responsibly."
