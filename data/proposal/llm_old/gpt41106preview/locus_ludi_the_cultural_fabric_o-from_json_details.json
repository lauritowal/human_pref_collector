        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity\n\nThe proposed project, \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity,\" is an ambitious interdisciplinary initiative aiming to provide the first comprehensive study of the role and significance of play and games within ancient societies. Spanning over a millennium, the project will cover extensive time periods from the Greek world (c. 800 BCE to 146 BCE) to the Roman world (c. 500 BCE to c. 500 CE), shedding light on a facet of antiquity that has hitherto been overlooked in scholarly research.\n\nThe project is inclusive in its approach, examining the participation of a wide array of social groups, including free men, slaves, men, women, adults, children, and even gods. It will unfold across different environments, exploring play and games in both towns and the countryside. Diverse source types such as written texts, archaeological finds, and iconographic evidence will be utilized to construct a multi-dimensional understanding of ancient ludic culture.\n\nLocus Ludi will employ various study focuses to dissect the evidence, including linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological lenses. This approach will yield a nuanced interpretation, recognizing the intricate connections between play and key areas such as gender studies and education studies.\n\nThe outcomes of the project are envisioned to be far-reaching and impactful. Practical applications include the development of innovative training models for researchers and educators, research models that can be applied to other historical contexts, and educational material suitable for various levels of schooling. Additionally, the project will produce materials tailored for museum and library settings, thus broadening the public's access to and engagement with the cultural heritage of play and games in classical antiquity.\n\nThrough \"Locus Ludi,\" we aim to unravel the complex web of societal norms, educational values, and religious beliefs reflected in the play and games of ancient civilizations, providing a unique lens through which to understand our cultural heritage."
