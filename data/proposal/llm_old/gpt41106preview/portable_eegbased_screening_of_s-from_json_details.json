        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns,\" aims to revolutionize early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by developing a portable and wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) device tailored for newborn screening. This innovative technology will enable rapid, automatic testing of face processing, a crucial social function often impaired in ASD, thus facilitating the identification of early objective biomarkers for newborns at risk.\n\nOur goals are ambitious yet achievable: we plan to design a portable EEG-based device specifically for newborns, ensuring it is capable of operating in any setting. The device will require less than two minutes of a newborn's visual attention to assess their social processing capabilities through an innovative oscillatory visual presentation. With the integration of dry electrodes and an automatic on-line extraction algorithm, the system will provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both clinical and home testing environments.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of our technology is its potential to close the current market gap by providing the first fully portable EEG system for newborns. It will allow for the early identification of ASD biomarkers, thereby enabling timely and effective behavioral interventions. Moreover, with the capacity for large-scale screening protocols, the device is poised to have a profound impact on public health.\n\nThe project will also contribute to the scientific community by facilitating research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions. Our wireless EEG device, with its low-power design, is not merely a step towards better healthcare but a leap towards a future where early interventions for ASD can be widely accessible, thus enhancing the quality of life for affected individuals and their families."
