        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century,\" aims to challenge and expand the current paradigms of musical performance by investigating the shift from text-based to performative-based musical works. The proposed project will delve into experimental performance practices and explore the potential transferability of the scientific experimentation model to music performance. Anchored in Artistic Research, the project is hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, which stands at the forefront of innovative musical scholarship.\n\nThe objectives of the research are threefold: first, to critically investigate the traditional conception of music performance that is bound to historical and textual fidelity; second, to create new paths for musical expression through experimental practices; and third, to assess the viability of applying scientific experimentation frameworks to the domain of music performance. To achieve these objectives, the research will employ methodologies that include material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs.\n\nExpected contributions of the project are substantial and diverse. They include theoretical and practical innovations in the field of music, opportunities for the development of new scholarship and performance practices, and the creation of concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. These contributions will not only redefine scholarly discourse surrounding artistic experimentation but also offer a tangible alternative to traditional 'interpretation' in music performance.\n\nThe practical components of the project encompass both theoretical investigation and active music practice, ensuring a robust and multifaceted approach. The anticipated project outputs include a paradigmatic change in the field of musical performance, influencing both academic research and practical application in the arts. Ultimately, this project seeks to engender a new understanding of musicality and performance in the twenty-first century, paving the way for a future where experimentation and innovation are central to the artistic experience."
