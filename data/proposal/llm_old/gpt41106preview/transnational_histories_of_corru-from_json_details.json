        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Transnational histories of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850),\" embarks on an ambitious historical inquiry into the conceptual evolution of 'corruption' during a pivotal century in Central-South-East Europe. The project, referred to as TransCorr, aims to construct a comprehensive history of 'corruption' as it was understood and critiqued by both foreign observers and indigenous critics. Spanning from 1750 to 1850, this study investigates themes such as political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, probing the motivations behind these practices, which range from political to professional to personal.\n\nTransCorr seeks to challenge and expand the existing historiography by tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption, demonstrating how certain customs were reframed as corrupt practices over time. It will examine the impacts of Great Power interventions on local governance and assess claims that these interventions led to more honest and efficient administrations, more effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations.\n\nThis project will also explore how narratives of corruption were linked to perceptions of cultural backwardness and economic under-development, thereby offering a critical perspective on the historical processes that shaped the region's encounter with modernity.\n\nThe scholarly contribution of TransCorr is manifold. It will stimulate dialogue with global modernization theories, align historiography with recent scientific innovations, reframe debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigure the understanding of center-periphery relations. By doing so, the project not only offers a novel historiographical approach but also addresses broader questions regarding the construction of political and social identities in the shadow of the Great Powers.\n\nUltimately, TransCorr will provide a nuanced understanding of the historical dynamics of 'corruption' and its multifaceted role in shaping the political and cultural landscapes of Central-South-East Europe during a transformative period. The project's findings are anticipated to have significant implications for contemporary discussions on governance, ethics, and the legacies of historical practices in the region."
