        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\" aims to develop a pioneering approach to understanding how Classical Antiquity is received and reshaped within children’s and young adults’ culture. The significance of this project lies in its potential to offer new insights into identity formation and the initiation of young people into adulthood. It also seeks to explore how the reception of Antiquity is creatively adapted to meet regional and global challenges, thereby contributing to the discourse on shared cultural heritage.\n\nCurrent research in this field has predominantly focused on Western interpretations of Classical Antiquity, often overlooking the diverse receptions in other cultures. This project proposes to bridge this gap by applying a more inclusive regional perspective and undertaking comparative studies of reception models across an array of cultures including Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. The innovation of this research lies in its comparative methodology, which encompasses regions that have traditionally been underrepresented in studies of the Graeco-Roman tradition.\n\nThe research team, composed of an international cohort of scholars, is poised to produce a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations as influenced by the reception of ancient myths.\n\nThe deliverables of the project include a supra-regional survey of classical references, detailed analyses of crucial reception cases, and the creation of educational materials on ancient myths tailored for work with disabled children. These resources aim to contribute to cultural integration and stimulate cultural exchange by highlighting the universality and adaptability of Classical Antiquity in contemporary youth culture. This project promises to reshape the understanding of our mythical heritage and its ongoing influence on global society."
