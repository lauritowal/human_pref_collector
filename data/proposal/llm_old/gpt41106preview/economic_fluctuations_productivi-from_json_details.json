        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective,\" aims to bridge the gap between Keynesian macroeconomics and endogenous growth theory to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between business cycles, productivity growth, and stabilization policies. The proposed project will develop a novel Keynesian growth framework that incorporates aggregate demand fluctuations with the mechanics of productivity growth in a unified theoretical model.\n\nThe research approach is three-fold: First, we will construct a Keynesian growth model featuring heterogeneous firms and integrate state-of-the-art quantitative features of endogenous growth. This model will serve as the foundation for analyzing how different economic policies can influence long-term growth trajectories. Second, we will extend the analysis to an open economy context, creating a Keynesian growth model that captures the nuances of monetary policy, capital flows, and their effects on productivity growth. The final component of our approach involves empirical testing to validate the model's predictions concerning the productivity growth response to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions.\n\nTwo case studies will be carried out to anchor the theoretical and empirical analysis in real-world events. The first will examine the economic phenomena following the Euro's inception, particularly the increase in capital flows and the observed stagnant productivity growth in recipient countries. The second study will estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to economic fluctuations in the United States and a panel of advanced economies, providing robust evidence for the proposed model's relevance and applicability.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to offer policymakers a nuanced understanding of productivity behavior during large recessions, such as the Great Recession, and to explore the potential for stagnation due to pessimistic expectations. Ultimately, the project seeks to inform better-designed monetary and fiscal policies that can stabilize economies and foster sustained productivity growth."
