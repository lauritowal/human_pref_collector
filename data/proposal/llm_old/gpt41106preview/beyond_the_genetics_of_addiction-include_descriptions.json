        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the urgent need to elucidate the intricate genetic and environmental underpinnings of individual variability in substance use and the propensity for substance abuse. Despite the recognition of substance use as a widespread issue—with nicotine and cannabis presenting clear health risks, and alcohol and caffeine intake having mixed effects—understanding the balance of heritable influences and environmental factors remains incomplete. Building upon foundational twin studies, including those conducted by the principal investigator, this research aims to dissect the multifaceted contributions to substance use behaviors.\n\nKey objectives of this project include: (1) leveraging extended twin family designs to dissect the genetic and environmental determinants of substance use; (2) employing DNA-variant data to pinpoint specific genes and gene networks implicated in substance use; (3) comparing gene expression profiles between substance users and non-users via RNA data; (4) identifying potential biomarkers through the analysis of blood or urine samples in these two groups; and (5) correlating substance use patterns with health outcomes through integration with national medical databases.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project will capitalize on the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), which encompasses a wealth of longitudinal phenotypic data and biological samples. The principal investigator's longstanding involvement with the NTR since 1999 ensures a deep familiarity with data collection, coordination, and analysis processes. The proposed work will be supported by a dedicated team that will gather additional necessary data. The availability of a large sample size and the application of sophisticated analytical techniques promise robust and comprehensive insights into the genetic and environmental interplay affecting substance use and abuse risk.\n\nThis project is poised to offer groundbreaking revelations in the field of behavior genetics and addiction research, significantly advancing our understanding of substance use disorders and informing the development of more effective prevention and intervention strategies."

Substance use is common. Substances like nicotine and cannabis have well-known negative health consequences, while alcohol and caffeine use may be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on quantity and frequency of use. Twin studies (including my own) demonstrated that both heritable and environmental factors play a role. My proposal on substance use (nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and caffeine) is organized around several key objectives: 1. To unravel the complex contribution of genetic and environmental factors to substance use by using extended twin family designs; 2. To identify and confirm genes and gene networks involved in substance use by using DNA-variant data; 3. To explore gene expression patterns with RNA data in substance users versus non-users; 4. To investigate biomarkers in substance users versus non-users using blood or urine; 5. To unravel relation between substance use and health by linking twin-family data to national medical databases. To realize these aims I will use the extensive resources of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR); including both the longitudinal phenotype database and the biological samples. I have been involved in data collection, coordination of data collection and analyzing NTR data since 1999. With my comprehensive experience in data collection, data analyses and my knowledge in the field of behavior genetics and addiction research I will be able to successfully lead this cutting-edge project. Additional data crucial for the project will be collected by my team. Large samples will be available for this study and state-of-the art methods will be used to analyze the data. All together, my project will offer powerful approaches to unravel the complex interaction between genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in substance use and the risk for abuse.",
