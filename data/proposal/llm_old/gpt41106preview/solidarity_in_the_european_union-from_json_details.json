        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Solidarity in the European Union,\" seeks to conceptualize and develop a normative model of solidarity that transcends traditional national boundaries (EUSOL1). By constructing this model, the project aims to critically apply it to core issues facing the European Union, thereby enhancing our understanding and guiding policy (EUSOL2). The project will address key challenges including the free movement of persons, equitable burden-sharing in the EU's refugee policy, financial inter-state transfers, and the processes surrounding enlargement and accession. The ambition is to deliver a comprehensive normative account of solidarity tailored to the unique political and social landscape of the EU. This work promises to generate actionable insights for policymakers, deepen scholarly discussions on European integration, and foster a sense of unity among EU member states through a shared framework of solidarity."
