        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies,\" aims to address the growing phenomenon of widowhood in an era where ageing populations are becoming increasingly prevalent and survival benefits are being reduced globally. Despite its societal importance, the study of widowhood has received less attention in social science research compared to divorce. This project seeks to fill this gap by developing a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the risk and duration of widowhood, the associated mental health and economic vulnerabilities, and the social inequalities that affect widowed individuals.\n\nEmploying innovative and advanced statistical methods, the project will analyze high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, covering the period from 1985 to a projected 2050. The research framework will consist of four pillars: examining risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood; exploring social inequalities influenced by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age; comparing the experiences of widowhood across different countries; and assessing how these patterns have changed over time.\n\nThe current limitations in assessments of widowhood, which often focus on wellbeing after unexpected bereavement, overlook the more prevalent scenario of terminal health decline before death. By considering both sudden and anticipated widowhood events, the project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the experiences faced by widowed individuals.\n\nThe outcome of this research will yield systematic and comprehensive estimates that illuminate the challenges faced by the widowed population and their family members. Furthermore, it will facilitate new research directions on sustainable pension and elder care systems, which are crucial for informing policy decisions in ageing societies. This project promises to offer invaluable insights into the social demography of widowhood, an event of increasing relevance in the contemporary world."
