        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\" seeks to address critical questions in the current European context of rising protectionist pressures, growing nationalistic tendencies, and a widespread disenchantment with globalization. The research aims to understand: the determinants of international trade patterns and their welfare effects, the alignment (or divergence) of individual incentives to trade with societal goals, and the necessity of government intervention to modulate international transactions.\n\nCentral to this research is the contention that traditional trade models, which typically assume homogeneity among firms, fail to capture the real-world complexities introduced by firm-level heterogeneity. The project will explore key dimensions where the answers provided by such models may be incomplete or misleading. Four work packages structure the research: \n\n1. Assessing the impact of firm heterogeneity and pricing distortions on market allocative efficiency and investigating their consequences on a country's aggregate economic performance, including whether economic integration ameliorates or exacerbates allocative inefficiency.\n\n2. Exploring the implications of firm heterogeneity for trade policy, emphasizing the cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements with the goal of maximizing the joint welfare of all trading partners.\n\n3. Examining the interaction between country, sector, and firm characteristics in response to trade liberalization, thereby refining our understanding of comparative advantages.\n\n4. Investigating the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping a country's exporter capabilities and productivity distribution among producers.\n\nThis project promises to yield significant insights into the complex interplay between firm-level differences and international trade dynamics, potentially guiding the formulation of more effective trade policies that align individual incentives with societal well-being."
