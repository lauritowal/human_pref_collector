        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Crisis on the Margins of the Byzantine Empire: A Bio-archaeological Project on Resilience and Collapse in Early Christian Development of the Negev Desert\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious bio-archaeological study aimed at understanding the dynamics of resilience and collapse within the ancient Byzantine early Christian urban centers of the Negev Desert during the 4th to 7th centuries AD. The project takes an innovative and integrative approach, combining a wide array of research methods, including household archaeology, landscape analysis, garbage examination, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, geological analysis, chronometric techniques, artifact analysis, and contextual data analysis. The overarching aim is to explore how this complex society withstood and adapted to the challenges of a resource-limited environment, addressing critical research questions on social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the impacts of plague.\n\nThe project's relevance extends beyond academic curiosity, as it confronts issues of societal vulnerability in marginal regionsâ€”a topic that resonates with contemporary global challenges of sustainable development. By investigating the limits of human ingenuity in the past, the project seeks to create a critical re-evaluation of current knowledge and contribute to more nuanced and informed generalizations regarding sustainable human-environment interactions.\n\nDespite the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, which presents a risk to the project, the benefits of generating new data and perspectives on the Byzantine Empire's societal functions are significant. This grant proposal requests support for a multidisciplinary endeavor that promises to shed new light on the intricate balance between societal collapse and resilience, offering vital lessons for modern-day sustainability issues."
