        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project titled \"Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences,\" aimed at advancing the understanding of household consumption behavior. Traditional models of household consumption often assume a unitary decision-making entity, which fails to capture the complex interactions among household members. This project proposes a non-unitary modeling approach using revealed preference methodology, which relies on the empirical analysis of actual consumption decisions to infer preferences without imposing heavy parametric assumptions.\n\nThe main contributions of this project are twofold. Theoretically, it seeks to incorporate marriage market dynamics into structural modeling of household behavior, addressing the gap in current literature where household formation is often overlooked. Empirically, the project aims to integrate revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation techniques to construct demand systems that reflect the reality of intrahousehold decision-making processes.\n\nThe objectives of the project include: demystifying the intrahousehold 'black box' by utilizing aggregate consumption information, avoiding the pitfalls of parametric assumptions on the decision processes, providing a detailed description of the intrahousehold decision process, and conducting comprehensive analysis of household consumption. These objectives will tackle challenges such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited explanatory power of traditional revealed preference restrictions.\n\nThe project will utilize pooled cross-section data sets to extract robust insights into household consumption patterns. By offering a more accurate and nuanced understanding of household behavior, this research has the potential to inform public policy, particularly in the areas of taxation, social welfare, and consumer protection."
