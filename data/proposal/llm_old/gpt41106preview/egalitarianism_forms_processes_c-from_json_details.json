        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the project \"Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons,\" which aims to explore the rich diversity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values across different cultures. The project will employ a combination of library-based global comparative study and field ethnographic studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the complexities inherent in egalitarian practices. By adopting a decentering approach that acknowledges the heterogeneity of these practices, the research will integrate both extensive literature survey and immersive ethnographic fieldwork.\n\nThe core research focus is to examine the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures and the cultural phenomena associated with forms and practices of egalitarianism, with a key proposition that these are deeply ingrained cultural values subject to various forces, contradictions, and limitations. Recognizing the necessity of a nuanced comparative method, the project aspires to develop one that is open to the varieties of conceptions and imaginings of egalitarianism and is responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances.\n\nThe research will address perennial questions such as the role of the state, the influence of religion, various forms of economic distribution, and the matter of scale in the implementation and perception of egalitarianism. Comparative studies will be conducted in various research sites throughout Europe and elsewhere, ensuring a broad and diverse data set.\n\nBy integrating library and field studies, the project seeks not only to understand egalitarian practices but also to contribute significantly to the development of a comparative method that respects and reveals the cultural richness of these practices. The project sets itself apart by emphasizing the cultural aspects of egalitarianism and its varied expressions in different societal contexts."
