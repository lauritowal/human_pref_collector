        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\" (RESCALE), seeks to undertake a comprehensive historical and philosophical analysis of the transformative shift in theoretical physics that has occurred since the 1950s. This shift is characterized by the development of scale-dependent theories, which has fundamentally altered the epistemological landscape of the discipline. The primary aim of RESCALE is to critically examine the impact of the pursuit of a final, unified theory on the evolution of modern physics and its philosophical underpinnings. Additionally, the project endeavors to scrutinize the scale-based theoretical practice that has emerged, focusing on its implications for our understanding of the natural world.\n\nThe RESCALE project will pursue several interrelated objectives, including an exploration of the philosophical consequences of scale-based physics for notions of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics. It will also assess how this scale-centric view has contributed to a complex, layered picture of reality, which challenges traditional interpretations of scientific theories. The project's importance lies in its potential to reveal a significant epistemological shift in the scientific understanding of the world, one that necessitates a reevaluation of philosophical approaches to interpreting physical theories.\n\nMethodologically, RESCALE will integrate a historical study of the rise of scale-based theoretical practices with a philosophical analysis of their broader implications. This dual approach will provide a nuanced account of how physicists' conceptualization of scales has influenced the structure and interpretation of theories that are operative at specific layers of reality.\n\nThrough its innovative historical and philosophical perspective, RESCALE aims to offer groundbreaking insights into the scale revolution in physics, providing a critical framework for understanding the complex interplay between scientific practice and philosophical interpretation in the contemporary scientific landscape."
