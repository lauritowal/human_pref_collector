        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600\"\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking historical research project entitled \"Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600.\" The project aims to critically assess and provide a new interpretation of state formation during a pivotal era in Western European history. Distinct from traditional top-down or bottom-up theories, this study will investigate the hypothesis of decentralization of legal authority, suggesting that the process of state formation may have been more complex than previously understood.\n\nThe project will focus on the period between 1300 and 1600 in Western Europe, a time of significant socio-political transformation. It will examine the centralization of fiscal and military resources, while challenging the assumption that centralization was a uniform process across regions. The research will explore the concept of 'states within states' and the role of elite support in shaping the trajectories of emerging states.\n\nCase studies will be conducted in diverse regions—Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire—to analyze variables such as state formation, urbanization, the socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent. This comparative approach will allow for a nuanced understanding of regional variations.\n\nEmploying path-dependency as an analytical framework, the project seeks to contribute to the social history of power by presenting an improved model that accounts for the complexities of historical change. Methodological innovation is a key component of the project, which will integrate perspectives from Central and Eastern Europe to provide a more holistic view of European state formation.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research will be a significant contribution to historical scholarship, challenging long-held assumptions and providing a richer, more detailed picture of the emergence of states in Western Europe."
