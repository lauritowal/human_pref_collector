        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions\n\nThe proposed project, \"InterCom,\" seeks to unveil the intricate dynamics of multigenerational communication within both familial and community contexts. Our research is driven by pressing questions about the impact of age-related variations in brain rhythms on conversational flow, the cognitive mechanisms employed by listeners when processing speech from different generations, and the potential attributions of intergenerational miscommunications to predictive conversational shortcomings in children and older adults. \n\nTo address these inquiries, our methodology integrates the collection of neurological, physiological, and linguistic data from children, adults, and older adults during storytelling events designed in collaboration with our community partners. We aim to create a seamless flow of information between real-world experiences and controlled laboratory settings, using each to inform and refine the other. This iterative process will enable us to develop stimuli that are deeply rooted in realistic social interactions while benefiting from the rigor of experimental control. \n\nThe objectives of InterCom are twofold: to combine data from diverse settings in a novel manner and to create a reciprocal relationship between real-world observations and laboratory analyses. Our goals are ambitious – to enhance the understanding of multigenerational communication patterns and to produce actionable insights and tools designed to improve cross-generational interactions. \n\nOur innovative 'community neuroscience' approach is poised to challenge conventional research paradigms by merging the benefits of naturalistic observation with the precision of laboratory studies. This groundbreaking strategy promises to yield significant contributions to the field of neuroscience, opening up new avenues for investigating and ameliorating communication across different age groups. With your support, we can unlock the secrets of intergenerational dialogue, fostering a more inclusive and understanding society for all generations."
