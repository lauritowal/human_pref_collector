        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Repetition, Parallelism and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\n\nThis grant proposal, designated as REPAC, seeks to delve into the intricate relationship between textual form and function within the literary and scholarly works of Ancient Mesopotamia. Centered on the first millennium BCE, this research will scrutinize the use of clay tablets inscribed with Akkadian Cuneiform, specifically examining genres such as literary, magical, and mantic texts. The project aims to dissect textual features like exact and variant repetition, parallelism, refrain, and ring composition—key elements in the construction of these ancient works.\n\nREPAC posits that such textual devices not only serve poetic, rhetorical, and argumentation purposes but also fulfill functions of aesthetic ornamentation, analogical reasoning, argument construction, and magical action. By studying the frequent employment of these features, the project endeavors to uncover the broader worldview of the Mesopotamian scribes, suggesting an interconnected belief system that attributes causal effectiveness to literary and magical practices.\n\nThe current knowledge gap lies in a comprehensive understanding of how worldview and analogy play roles in the Mesopotamian literary and scholarly methods. REPAC aims to bridge this gap by closely analyzing the inherent creativity and inventiveness reflected in the texts—creativity that is often manifested through the deliberate use of repetition and parallelism.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is an enriched understanding of Ancient Mesopotamian creative efforts and the complex ways in which these civilizations constructed meaning. Through detailed investigation and scholarly inquiry, REPAC will contribute significantly to the fields of literary studies, history, and cultural understanding, shedding light on the cognitive processes behind one of history's earliest civilizations.\n\nWord Count: 273 words"
