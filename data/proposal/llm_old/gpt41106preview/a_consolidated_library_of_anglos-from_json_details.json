        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" aims to create an unprecedented online interactive library to house the entire surviving corpus of Anglo-Saxon verse, spanning from c. 670–1100 CE. This digital repository will consist of approximately 60,000 lines of poetry, equally distributed between Old English and Anglo-Latin, and will incorporate sound and image files to enhance the user experience. The poetry, primarily transmitted through manuscript witnesses, includes works by around 50 named poets, with a significant proportion of anonymous verse.\n\nThis initiative will employ the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 XML guidelines to ensure that the digital texts meet the highest standards of scholarly encoding, thus facilitating complex searches and research inquiries. The project pays particular attention to documenting the influence of named poets and tracing potential influences within the corpus of anonymous verse. By making this comprehensive multilingual corpus available online, the project will break new ground in the study of how Latin and the vernacular coexisted within the Christian cultural context of early medieval Europe.\n\nIn addition to the online library, the project will engage the scholarly community and wider public through a series of conferences and workshops aimed at disseminating findings and encouraging collaboration. A series of publications will also emerge, focusing on the vast geographical scope of the research impact and contributing to the broader understanding of medieval European literary culture.\n\nThe proposed project promises to transform our comprehension of Anglo-Saxon poetry and its role in shaping European literary traditions. It will provide an essential resource for scholars, students, and enthusiasts, ensuring that this rich literary heritage remains accessible and relevant in the digital age."
