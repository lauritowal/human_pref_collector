        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\n\nThe human visual system is the best-understood domain of the brain, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of why individuals with normal sight perceive the world differently. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the interplay between physiological states, personality traits, and visual processing. The objective is to comprehend the impact of physiological conditions, such as induced ketosis, and personality on the visual processing capabilities of normally sighted individuals, including young children.\n\nEmploying innovative approaches, the research will integrate pupil responses, cutting-edge ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysical methods to measure visual processing. Through these methods, the project anticipates uncovering behavioral and cortical properties that co-vary with personality traits, thereby challenging existing paradigms.\n\nThe proposed interventions involve inducing ketosis through fasting and intense physical activity to investigate the resultant changes in visual perception and cortical processing. The expected outcomes include the identification of new reliable biomarkers for local, context-independent perception, and evidence supporting the notion that perceptual style can be altered within individuals due to metabolic changes.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are vast, including transforming our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aiding in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and encouraging the development of therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. By combining visual processing measures with physiological interventions, this project stands to provide groundbreaking insights into the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perceptionâ€”knowledge that could revolutionize the field of visual neuroscience and have far-reaching implications for both scientific understanding and clinical practice."
