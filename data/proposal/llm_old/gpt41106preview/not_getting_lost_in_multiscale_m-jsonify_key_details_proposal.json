Past research told us how to design paper topographic maps at a given scale to make them readable and understandable by human users. But these rules/guidelines do not apply anymore, and map designers lack guidelines to make maps that are smooth to explore through scales, and it is common for a multi-scale map user to feel lost for a few seconds after a zooming interaction. The LostInZoom project (Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management) seeks to establish a new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps, based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during the zoom. To achieve this novel zooming paradigm, we need new grounding knowledge on how people perceive and understand interactive multi-scale maps, in order to design maps and interaction that make multi-scale explorations smoother. The LostInZoom project will be based on three main pillars. In the first one, we will explore the cognition of multi-scale interactive maps with an experimentation approach, in order to identify the anchors or landmarks that help a map reader locate himself when zooming. In the second pillar, we will design new cartographic generalisation techniques to derive multi-scale maps that magnify the landmarks that are important for multi-scale exploration. Finally, the third pillar will be dedicated to the design of new zooming interactions that focus on these landmarks to smooth even more the zooming exploration."
