        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge,\" embarks on a groundbreaking investigation into the roots of social science through the lens of sociographic journalism in the 1800s. This pioneering study aims to elucidate the significant, yet overlooked, contribution of journalists' sociographic works—such as social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures—to the nascent field of social science.\n\nThe project spans an impressive geographical scope, encompassing Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, thus offering a wide-reaching analysis of sociographic journalism's impact. Employing anthropological and historiographical approaches, the research will delve into the representational techniques of sociographic journalism, its connections with contemporary epistemic developments, and its integration within the socio-spatial settings of the era. Furthermore, it will investigate these journalistic artefacts' ties to academic, artistic, and governmental endeavors, contextualizing them within the broader processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.\n\nAs outcomes, the project anticipates generating a series of essays, organizing an international conference, curating a public exhibition, and producing a scholarly volume alongside two monographs. These outputs are designed not only to share the findings with the academic community but also to engage the public in understanding the historical underpinnings of social science. This comprehensive examination will not only provide an original scholarly contribution to the fields of anthropology, history, and media studies but will also offer a new perspective on the evolution of ethnographic and sociological knowledge.\n\nThrough this research, we seek to establish nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as a key precursor to modern social science, shedding light on its foundational role in shaping the discipline and contributing to our understanding of the social fabric of the time."
