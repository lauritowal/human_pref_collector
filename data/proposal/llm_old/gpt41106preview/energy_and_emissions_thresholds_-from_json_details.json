        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Energy and emissions thresholds for providing decent living standards to all,\" aims to establish a quantifiable relationship between the provision of decent living standards and its implications for energy consumption and climate change. This research directly addresses pivotal questions: What specific goods and services constitute 'decent living standards', and how do the energy requirements for providing these necessities vary across different cultural and socio-economic contexts, particularly in five emerging economies?\n\nThe project's objectives are to develop a comprehensive understanding of the energy needs associated with decent living standards, evaluate the climate change impacts of such energy use, and explore sustainable, low-carbon pathways for socio-economic development. Additionally, it seeks to contribute to the formulation of equitable climate mitigation strategies through the assessment of burden-sharing mechanisms.\n\nThe methodology encompasses three cutting-edge analytical approaches: lifecycle analysis to assess the energy and emissions footprint of goods and services, input-output analysis to trace the broader economic impacts of energy consumption, and integrated assessment modelling to project the long-term climate change outcomes. These methods will be applied to emerging economies, considering each country's unique cultural, climatic, technological, and contextual factors.\n\nTask 1 involves operationalizing the concept of basic needs within human development and identifying the characteristics of essential goods within household consumption patterns. Task 2 quantifies the energy and emissions for these goods and services in the focus countries. Task 3 explores the evolution of these basic goods and their energy intensity, providing insights into the developmental trajectories of emerging economies.\n\nThis project is poised to deliver critical insights for policymakers, helping to align developmental goals with climate mitigation efforts, a step forward in achieving both global equity and environmental sustainability."
