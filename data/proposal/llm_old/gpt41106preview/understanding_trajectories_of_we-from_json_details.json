        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability,\" aims to provide a groundbreaking analysis of the patterns and determinants of wealth accumulation over the course of individuals' lives. Under the project code WEALTHTRAJECT, the research team seeks to achieve several key objectives, including documenting the variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives, identifying the intragenerational drivers that contribute to this variability, establishing the intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories, and collecting novel life history data on wealth accumulation.\n\nThis innovative study stands out for its methodological approach, which emphasizes the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses that individuals experience. It uniquely combines longitudinal data derived from surveys and official registers with original life history data on wealth, applying advanced quantitative methods to analyze this rich dataset. The focal points of the project are to understand the long-term trajectories of wealth accumulation, to explore the nuances of wealth inequality, and to investigate the factors contributing to trajectory variability.\n\nA key innovation of this project is its comprehensive assessment of wealth accumulation, which has not been systematically examined to this extent before. The research promises to provide insights into the different ways individuals and social groups navigate wealth accumulation and highlight potential policy implications for addressing wealth inequality.\n\nBy exploring the complex and variable nature of wealth trajectories, the project aims to contribute significantly to the literature on social stratification and economic inequality. Its outcomes have the potential to inform policies and interventions designed to promote more equitable wealth distribution and to enhance the financial stability and well-being of individuals across different life stages and social backgrounds."
