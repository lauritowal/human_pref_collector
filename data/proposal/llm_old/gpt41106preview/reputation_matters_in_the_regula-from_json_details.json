        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal \"Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability\" (RICA) addresses crucial challenges at the intersection of political science and public administration. RICA aims to reconceptualize fundamental assumptions of the regulatory state, rethinking normative and institutional design principles that underpin regulatory bodies. The project is particularly timely in the context of increasing non-majoritarianism and the devaluation of the political process, which raise concerns about the balance between accountability and autonomy in regulatory agencies.\n\nRICA is structured into two principal modules. Module 1 examines the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, hypothesizing that increased insulation negatively affects perceived credibility. Module 2 aims to advance a richer understanding of accountability by developing a new theory that considers how reputation shapes accountability behavior among regulators.\n\nCentral to this proposal is the examination of key concepts such as regulatory independence, credibility, accountability, and autonomy. The approach will draw insights from the political science literature on reputation, arguing that reputation is a critical yet underexplored facet influencing regulatory bodies' functionality and legitimacy.\n\nThrough its innovative approach and theoretical contributions, RICA promises to offer groundbreaking perspectives that question established wisdom and propose new frameworks for understanding the dynamics of regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability. The expected outcomes have the potential to transform the way regulatory agencies are structured and operate, ensuring that they can maintain their independence while being effectively accountable, thus enhancing their credibility and integrity in the eyes of the public they serve."
