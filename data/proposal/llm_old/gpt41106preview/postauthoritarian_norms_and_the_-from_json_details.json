        "Abstract:\n\nThe research project titled \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" aims to investigate the enduring influence of former authoritarian regimes on the political landscape of new democracies. This study focuses on Poland, Portugal, and other Eastern European countries that have transitioned from authoritarian rule since the reference years of 2015 and 2019. The project will deploy survey experiments as its primary research method to delve into the complex relationship between voters' ideological associations with past dictatorships and the evolving norms of political competition.\n\nCentral to the inquiry is the decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the belated rise of a radical right party in Portugal, and the increased propensity for right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. By examining factors such as voter avoidance of ideologies linked to former dictatorships, the impact on party competition, citizens' ideological preferences, and perceptions of party stances, this research will provide a comprehensive analysis of the ideological legacy left by authoritarian regimes. It will also explore the role of national identity, political discussions, the emergence of new parties, post-transition party names, programmatic stances, and party elite discourse.\n\nThe expected output is a pioneering theory that elucidates the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies, offering a novel perspective on why some ideologies are rejected in the post-authoritarian context. This theory will significantly contribute to our understanding of the formative role of historical legacies in shaping contemporary political systems."
