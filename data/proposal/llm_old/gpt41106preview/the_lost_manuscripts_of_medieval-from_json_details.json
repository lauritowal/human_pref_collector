        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts\" (LostMa), an innovative research project aimed at unraveling the complexities of cultural evolution through the lens of written artefacts. LostMa seeks to illuminate the intricate processes through which human cultures evolve by focusing on the transmission, transformation, and preservation of medieval manuscript texts. \n\nThe primary objectives of LostMa include understanding the dynamics of cultural transmission, determining the impact of randomness on the survival of written artefacts, and investigating the mechanisms by which manuscripts were copied, altered, or lost over time. The project endeavors to uncover how these processes contribute to the formation of cultural canons and the survival of texts.\n\nTo achieve its aims, LostMa employs a multifaceted methodology that integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence with complexity science and philological expertise. The project will utilize stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations to model the transmission of texts. Moreover, it incorporates deep learning techniques for extensive data collection, enabling the analysis of approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts out of a broader dataset of 4000 documents spanning Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages.\n\nA case study on chivalric literature within a European context will serve as the focal point for this investigation. LostMa examines the transmission of these texts as a dynamic process, drawing parallels with the evolution of organisms or language variants, featuring elements of innovation or mutation, fixation, or extinction.\n\nBy dissecting the factors that influence the preservation or loss of cultural artefacts, LostMa promises to provide valuable insights into the role of chance, human agency, and cultural practices in shaping our historical and cultural heritage. The outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cultural evolution and inform the preservation strategies for our collective written legacy."
