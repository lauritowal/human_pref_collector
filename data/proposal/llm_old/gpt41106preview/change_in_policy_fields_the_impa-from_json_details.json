        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010,\" aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the evolution of morality policies. The study is focused on assessing the systematic empirical knowledge on the development of such policies and developing explanations to identify patterns of changes within these policy fields over a thirty-year period. This research will delve into morality policy changes over time, allowing for a cross-country comparison as well as a comparison across various policy subfields within the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe objectives are twofold: to furnish empirical knowledge on the trajectory of morality policies, and to elucidate the factors behind these patterns of change. The study will concentrate on critical subfields of study, including policies related to life and death (such as abortion and euthanasia), sexuality (including the regulation of prostitution, pornography, and homosexuality), and addictive substances and behaviors.\n\nEmploying a hybrid methodology that combines macro-quantitative analysis with qualitative case studies, the project will analyze legislative output data from the 25 countries. The quantitative analysis will inform the selection of critical cases for in-depth qualitative examination. This approach is designed to uncover the interplay between international and domestic influences on the formation and transformation of morality policies.\n\nThis groundbreaking research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of policy development in the context of morality issues, providing valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and society at large."
