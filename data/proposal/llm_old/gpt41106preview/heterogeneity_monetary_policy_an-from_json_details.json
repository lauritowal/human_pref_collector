        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations\" seeks to advance the understanding of how individual differences within an economy influence aggregate outcomes and the efficacy of monetary policy. The research focuses on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, which incorporate a variety of agents with differing constraints and financial situations. This project aims to assess the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and study its implications for monetary policy.\n\nThe objectives of the project are twofold. First, it aims to develop an organizing framework that distinguishes between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents, a critical step in understanding the varied responses to economic policies and shocks. Second, the project will conduct a comparative analysis of HANK models with Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) models and Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models, focusing on the aggregate equilibrium dynamics that result from each modeling approach.\n\nThe analysis will delve into the 'heterogeneity wedge' in consumption and investment, exploring the components and channels that dictate how heterogeneity impacts overall economic activity in HANK models and actual economies. A significant aspect of this research is the comparative study of the three types of models to understand the nuances and implications of each for both theoretical and practical aspects of economic policy.\n\nProposed applications of the findings include examining the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of 'helicopter drops'—or broad-based financial distributions—on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on the formulation of optimal monetary policy. The project is poised to provide insights into the complexities of modern economies, helping policymakers to tailor their approaches to the diverse circumstances and behaviors of economic agents.\n\nThe grant will enable a comprehensive study of the heterogeneity wedge and its components, thereby enhancing the understanding of the channels through which heterogeneity operates and informs monetary policy decisions."
