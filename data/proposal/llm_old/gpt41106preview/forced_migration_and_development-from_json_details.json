        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Forced Migration and Development (FORCEDMIGDEV)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address the critical issue of forced migration, which currently affects 68.5 million individuals worldwide, with 85% being hosted by developing countries. The project, FORCEDMIGDEV, aims to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in these countries, with a specific emphasis on two distinct areas of focus.\n\nThe first area examines the impact of refugee inflows on host economies, utilizing the case study of Syrian refugees in Turkey. Project activities will include the development of a structural model to estimate the distributional effects of refugee shocks and assess the welfare effects across different regions within the host country. Additionally, the study will investigate the effects of granting legal status to refugees, which is a critical policy issue with far-reaching implications.\n\nThe second area of the project centers on the internal displacement caused by climate shocks, with a detailed case study in Brazil. The approach combines reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the immediate effects of such shocks and then progresses to develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement on Brazil's economy. This part of the project will bridge the intersection between climate and development economics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics at play.\n\nIn summary, the FORCEDMIGDEV project will yield significant insights into the economic dimensions of forced migration, offering valuable information for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions. The findings are expected to contribute to the broader discourse on development economics, highlighting the challenges and potential strategies for countries grappling with the influx of displaced populations due to conflict or climate change."
