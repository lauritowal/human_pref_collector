        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times,\" seeks to delve into the complex narratives surrounding the Portuguese colonial-liberation wars (1961-1974/5). Through a diachronic and comparative approach, the research will investigate the memories of the conflicts fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements, focusing on Portugal and its former colonies: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe.\n\nThe key hypothesis is that these wars have triggered processes of memorialisation and silencing, each with its distinct historicity. The project consists of two strands: \"Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States,\" which will explore the role of states in the past mobilisation, articulation, recognition, and selective representations of these wars; and \"Memory as a battlefield,\" which will scrutinize the uses of the past and the dynamics between social and individual memories.\n\nThe objectives are ambitious and multifaceted: to produce innovative knowledge about the memories and silences of war, to contrast changes in memory and silence from the end of the conflicts to the present, to examine historical judgements and memories in Portugal and African countries, to offer a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies, and to address the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism.\n\nThrough the CROME project (Colonial Remembrance & Oblivion: Memory Exploration), the research aims to provide an illuminating exploration of memories and silences related to these wars, comparing their evolution and impact in the postcolonial context. This project promises to contribute significantly to the understanding of how colonial-liberation wars have shaped, and continue to influence, national identities, cultural narratives, and political discourse in the postcolonial era."
