        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\" seeks to explore the underrecognized role of Asian ports and European East India companies in the emergence of modern industrial capitalism. Spanning three centuries, the study focuses on the economic activities and interdependencies between European and local merchants within the Asian maritime trading network. This ambitious research aims to challenge and enrich the current understanding of global economic change by highlighting the significance of over 150 factories—trading posts and settlements—as pivotal nodes in intercontinental trade.\n\nA central objective of this project is to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, thereby recasting the narrative of global economic development and the rise of capitalism. It will draw on an innovative methodology that integrates vast archival repositories and relies on international collaborations to construct a new spatial theory of capitalist development. This approach promises to contribute a decolonized perspective to the New History of Capitalism, recognizing the integral role of non-European actors and locations in the genesis of a global economic system.\n\nThrough addressing research questions concerning the economic activities in imperial trading centers and the interactive roles of European and local merchants, the project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the diverse factors contributing to the capitalist transformation. The project will run over a five-year period and promises to deliver a significant contribution to the fields of economic history, global studies, and the decolonization of historical narratives.\n\nIn summary, this research proposal offers a groundbreaking reexamination of the origins of global capitalism, centering on the vibrant economic dynamism of Asian ports and their interaction with European corporate entities, thus providing a comprehensive and inclusive historical account."
