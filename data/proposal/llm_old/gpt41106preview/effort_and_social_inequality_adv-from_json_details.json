        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects,\" seeks to investigate the nuanced role of effort in the intergenerational transmission of social inequality. Its central aims are to comprehend the impact of effort on social stratification, advance our knowledge of intergenerational mobility, and contribute to improving equality of opportunity. The research will address critical questions such as the variation in children's effort levels across different socioeconomic backgrounds, the influence of parental effort levels on their children, and the optimal methods for quantifying cognitive effort.\n\nEmploying innovative approaches, the project intends to develop and utilize state-of-the-art measures of effort through real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques, such as pupillometry. The study will focus on a sample of school-age children and their parents from Spain and Germany to ensure a diverse and representative dataset. Data analysis will encompass experimental data collection, examination of subjective effort dispositions through national and international surveys, and a rigorous triangulation of methodologies to ensure robust and cross-validated findings.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are significant. It aims to provide the first reliable evidence of socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate further inquiry into effort disparities across gender or ethnic lines, offer valuable insights for educational practitioners, and inform normative debates regarding social inequality and policy design. By exploring and clarifying the complex relationship between effort and social background, this project will shed light on a critical aspect of social mobility and inequality, with the potential to shape future educational interventions and policy initiatives aimed at fostering a more equitable society."
