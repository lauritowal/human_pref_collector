        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges\" (REPAIR) embarks on a pioneering investigation into the burgeoning demands for reparations within diverse global development contexts. This comparative social-scientific study is unprecedented in its examination of reparations related to infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, violations of minority rights, and the impacts of toxic environments. With an objective to dissect the modes of establishment, execution, and reception of reparatory payments, REPAIR aims to elucidate the economic, moral, and political dimensions of reparations in development.\n\nCentral to the project's innovation is its comprehensive approach, which broadens the scope of reparations study beyond traditional lenses. By employing novel theory and methods derived from economic anthropology, REPAIR is poised to redefine our understanding of reparations as a crucial form of wealth transfer, delving into the 'reparative aspects' of economic life. This approach will not only shed light on the practical implications of reparations but also contribute to theoretical discourses on justice, equity, and the role of wealth redistribution in societal development.\n\nREPAIR's outcomes are expected to offer valuable insights for policymakers, development practitioners, and scholars who engage with the complex interplay between historical injustices and contemporary developmental challenges. By identifying the reparative nature of economic transactions in these contexts, the project will foster a deeper comprehension of the potential for reparations to serve as transformative mechanisms within global development initiatives.\n\nIn sum, REPAIR seeks to break new ground in the interdisciplinary field of reparations research, providing a robust analytical framework for understanding the profound impacts of reparative justice on the global stage."
