        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Life in a cold climate: the adaptation of cereals to new environments and the establishment of agriculture in Europe,\" aims to explore the complex interplay between environmental adaptation and the spread of early agriculture across the European landscape. The central objective is to assess the influence of environmental adaptation on the development and adoption of agriculture as the primary subsistence strategy, leading to the establishment of farming communities throughout Europe.\n\nCereals such as barley and wheat are at the heart of this study, which seeks to address significant challenges, including the impact of ecological pressures on crops and a comprehensive understanding of both the human and environmental dimensions contributing to the domestication of crops in Europe. To this end, the project will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing cutting-edge methods such as population genomics, ecological modelling, ancient DNA sequencing, and advanced computational techniques to establish the temporal order of adaptations.\n\nExpected outputs of this research include the identification of loci in the genomes of barley and wheat that have been under natural selection, the association of these selected loci with ecogeographical variables, and the precise dating of these adaptation periods. By synthesizing this genetic evidence with dating evidence for the spread of agriculture and correlating it with demographic data, the project promises to offer valuable insights into Neolithic population dynamics and crop productivity. Additionally, analysis of an archaeobotanical database will enhance our understanding of the domestication process.\n\nThis project stands to correct the current imbalance between human and environmental dimensions in domestication studies and will provide a nuanced narrative of the Neolithic transition in Europe, contributing to our broader understanding of agricultural innovation and resilience. By investigating the genetic basis of cereal crops' adaptation to cold climates, the project will shed light on a pivotal chapter in human history, marking a significant advancement in the field of agricultural archaeogenomics."
