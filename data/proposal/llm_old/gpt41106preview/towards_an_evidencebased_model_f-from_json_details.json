        "Abstract:\n\nBig data policing represents a cutting-edge approach in law enforcement, leveraging historical crime data to forecast high-risk areas and improve the allocation of police resources. Despite its promise, European research on big data policing remains fragmented, with a significant lack of interdisciplinary studies and robust scientific evaluations. The proposed project, \"Towards an evidence-based model for big data policing: Evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological and legal and ethical conditions,\" aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps.\n\nThis project endeavors to create an evidence-based model for big data policing that encompasses statistical-methodological rigor, criminological insights, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations. It will incorporate variables such as previous crime events, socio-economic indicators like the poverty index, residential mobility, commercial activity, infrastructure proximity, and law enforcement strategies, including the deployment of intelligent cameras and patrol intensities.\n\nA unique feature of this proposal is its innovation in developing a model that prioritizes transparency in predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and adherence to legal and ethical standards, thereby distinguishing it from predominantly commercial and economically driven initiatives. The project involves a set of PhD tracks, each dedicated to one of the core dimensions—statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical—ensuring a truly interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThe project's objective will be realized through rigorous randomized controlled trials, ensuring the model's applicability and effectiveness within European contexts. By bridging the interdisciplinary divide, this project will not only contribute to the academic understanding of big data policing but will also offer practical tools and frameworks for its responsible implementation. The outcome will be a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for policymakers and law enforcement agencies, ensuring that the adoption of big data strategies in policing meets the highest standards of public trust and accountability."
