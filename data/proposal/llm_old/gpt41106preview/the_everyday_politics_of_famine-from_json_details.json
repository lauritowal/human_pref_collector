        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" seeks to uncover the underlying political dynamics at play in communities affected by famine, an increasingly frequent and deadly crisis. In 2022 alone, famine conditions were experienced by 250,000 individuals, with an additional 35 million on the brink. Despite these alarming figures, the persistence of famine and its normalization as a deadly event have yet to be fully understood from a political perspective.\n\nThe project proposes an ethnographically-informed comparative study focusing on two primary research sites: South Sudan and Somalia. These locations have been deliberately chosen due to their recent experiences with famine and the potential insights their communities can provide into the everyday politics of such crises. The research aims to shift the science of famine politics by exploring four key strands: (1) the histories and musical memories of past famines, (2) community narratives that enforce social networks, (3) burial and posthumous practices, and (4) the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. Each strand will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of why famines persist and the societal mechanisms that may contribute to blame displacement for famine suffering.\n\nThe team tasked with this research comprises Somali and South Sudanese members, ensuring an authentic and informed perspective. Their qualifications include previous experience in the field, established networks within affected communities, carefully built capacity to engage with sensitive issues, and a proven track record of conducting similar studies. The team's unique composition and expertise are crucial in achieving the goal of providing a nuanced understanding of the interplay between famine and politics.\n\nThrough this study, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge around famine and its political dimensions, potentially informing more effective interventions and policies to prevent future crises."
