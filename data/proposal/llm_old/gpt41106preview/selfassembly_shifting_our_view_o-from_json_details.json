        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\n\nThe AssemblingLife project proposes a paradigm shift in the understanding of life from a biology-centric view of energy input and genetic regulation to a new perspective centered on self-assembly. Self-assembly, the spontaneous organization of systems without external direction, challenges traditional beliefs about the causal role of genetic material and the formation of complex life patterns. Our interdisciplinary team, spanning the fields of nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science, seeks to develop a novel theoretical framework that reconceptualizes genetic influence as 'nudging' rather than dictating outcomes.\n\nThe primary objectives of the project are twofold: first, to redefine genetic causation, positioning genes as subtle influencers in the self-assembly process; and second, to construct a comprehensive theory of scientific explanation tailored to self-assembly mechanisms. This innovative approach will facilitate a deeper understanding of life's complexity and provide a robust, philosophical foundation for interpreting empirical data within the life sciences.\n\nThe potential impacts of AssemblingLife extend beyond academia, aiming to fundamentally alter the way life is perceived within science and philosophy. By offering fresh conceptual tools to both the philosophy of science and empirical research disciplines, the project promises to broaden the horizons of scientific inquiry and foster a more nuanced appreciation of life's intricacies.\n\nAssemblingLife represents a bold step forward in our comprehension of the natural world, with the potential to inspire new research methodologies and catalyze scientific advancements across multiple disciplines. We seek funding to pioneer this transformative exploration into the essence of life, inviting a reevaluation of long-held assumptions and sparking a revolutionary dialogue in the scientific community."
