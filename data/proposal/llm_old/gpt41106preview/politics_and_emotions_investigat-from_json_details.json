        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively\" (POLEMIC) aims to delve into the intricate relationship between emotional appeals in politics and their impact on citizens' political choices. As an interdisciplinary endeavor, POLEMIC will bridge the gap between party politics and political psychology, addressing pivotal research questions about the influence of emotional appeals on political behavior, the historical increase in such appeals by politicians, and the underlying reasons for this trend.\n\nSpanning from 1945 to the present, POLEMIC will conduct a comparative analysis across nine countries to explore whether emotional appeals have become a strategic tool to maximize votes or are merely a reflection of politicians' personalities or a fashionable trend. The project will employ cutting-edge methods, including automated text analysis to scrutinize political discourse and physiological measurements to assess citizens' responses, thereby integrating macro-level perspectives on what politicians say with micro-level insights on how citizens react.\n\nThe research will test predominant theories, such as the vote-maximizing strategy, the influence of politicians' personal traits, and the concept of fashionable trends in political communication. By doing so, POLEMIC will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play in the use of emotional appeals in politics. It is anticipated that the findings will reveal the significance of emotion in citizens' decision-making processes and the level of rationality behind politicians' use of emotional appeals.\n\nThis groundbreaking research is expected to extend existing theoretical paradigms and introduce innovative methodologies to elucidate the conditions under which emotional appeals are persuasive or ineffective due to established emotional attachments. The project's outcomes will offer valuable insights for political strategists, psychologists, and the general public, fostering a more nuanced appreciation of the role of emotions in the political sphere."
