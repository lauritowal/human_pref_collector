        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Inference in Microeconometric Models\n\nThis grant proposal presents a cutting-edge research project aimed at developing robust inference methods for microeconometric models, specifically by leveraging longitudinal data to account for unobserved heterogeneity among economic agents. The project, titled \"Inference in Microeconometric Models,\" focuses on addressing the challenges posed by unobserved differences that significantly influence economic outcomes, including schooling decisions, wages, and employment durations.\n\nThe project is structured into three integral blocks, each targeting a specific advancement in econometric analysis. Block 1 aims to improve the performance of statistical hypothesis tests by focusing on inference on nonlinear models. Block 2 seeks to establish formal results by innovating the estimation of models for network data, treating such data as panel data to extract deeper insights. Finally, Block 3 concentrates on non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models, incorporating factors such as unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables.\n\nThe proposed inference methods have a wide array of applications, with immediate relevance to key economic issues such as labor force participation and the import and export behaviors of firms and countries. These applications underscore the project's potential to significantly enhance our understanding of economic dynamics and inform policy decisions.\n\nAssessment of the proposed methods will be rigorous, encompassing both theoretical examinations and simulation studies. By combining these approaches, the research aims to validate the robustness and practicality of the new inference methods. The outcomes of this project are expected to set a new benchmark in the field of microeconometrics, facilitating more accurate and reliable econometric analyses that account for the complex realities of economic behavior.\n\nKeywords: Microeconometrics, Inference Methods, Longitudinal Data, Unobserved Heterogeneity, Nonlinear Models, Network Data, Dynamic Discrete-Choice Models"
