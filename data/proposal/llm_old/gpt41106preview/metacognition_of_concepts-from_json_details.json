        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Metacognition of Concepts\" or \"MetCogCon,\" seeks to illuminate the complex thoughts and feelings that arise during the use of essential cognitive tools—concepts. Concepts such as 'GENE,' 'MEME,' 'RACE,' and 'SPECIES' are indispensable for human cognitive capabilities, serving as the building blocks for thoughts, the framework for understanding our world, and the criteria for making decisions. Despite their critical role, the metacognition of these concepts—the introspective awareness and management of their use—is not well understood and lacks a comprehensive theoretical foundation.\n\nThe objective of MetCogCon is to investigate the metacognitive processes that influence the decision to rely on, reject, or embrace various concepts. This research will explore how metacognition affects the selection of concepts for reasoning, induction, and the competition for cognitive resources that determine action control. By examining these processes, the project aims to shed light on the dependability and suitability of concepts as tools for thought.\n\nTo achieve this, MetCogCon will integrate analytic methods from the philosophy of mind with cognitive science. It will employ psychological model-building and conduct experimental investigations to develop a deeper understanding of how individuals reflect on their thought processes concerning conceptual usage.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are manifold. It promises to improve our understanding of cognitive control and address long-standing philosophical problems regarding concept selection and use. Practical applications of this work include informing reasoning policies in both everyday life and specialized scientific or philosophical contexts. Moreover, it will contribute to the determination of the reliability of heuristics in concept selection, significantly impacting various domains where decision-making is critical.\n\nThe expected outcome of MetCogCon is an enhanced understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind, offering insights into our metacognitive faculties and their influence on our interaction with the world through the concepts we use."
