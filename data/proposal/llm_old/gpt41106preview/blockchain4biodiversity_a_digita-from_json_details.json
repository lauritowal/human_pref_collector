        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nThe proposed project, Blockchain4Biodiversity, aims to address critical issues in agrobiodiversity through the development and testing of a novel digital platform, ReSeed. This initiative will focus on leveraging blockchain technology to incentivize the conservation and cultivation of farmers' indigenous seeds (ISK) and their associated know-how. Despite their significant contributions to global food security and sustainable agriculture, ISK cultivation and conservation are currently facing declining economic incentives, and such knowledge is often ineligible for intellectual property protection. Furthermore, there is an absence of tracking systems for the end use of ISK, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability.\n\nReSeed aims to fill this gap by creating a decentralized, transparent, and immutable system that will facilitate equitable and traceable transfers of ISK. The platform is designed to incentivize honest reporting of downstream research, thus promoting the responsible use of these resources. Our mixed-methods research approach will engage key stakeholders, including suppliers and buyers of ISK, ensuring that the platform is integrated with international regulatory frameworks and requires minimal legal amendments.\n\nThe governance model for ReSeed will include ethics guidelines that respect the rights and contributions of small farmers' communities, who are often the custodians of agrobiodiversity. The project builds on 12 years of previous research and promises multiple benefits, such as promoting in situ conservation, fostering research and innovation with agrobiodiversity, adding value to farmers’ ISK, and delivering economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.\n\nBy aligning economic incentives with sustainable practices, Blockchain4Biodiversity's ReSeed platform is poised to revolutionize the way indigenous seeds and knowledge are shared and utilized, ensuring that agrobiodiversity can flourish for generations to come."
