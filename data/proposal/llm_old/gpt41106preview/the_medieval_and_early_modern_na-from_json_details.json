        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\nThe proposed project aims to illuminate the hitherto dimly understood sphere of the History of Cartography, specifically focusing on the medieval and early modern nautical charts which played a crucial role in maritime expansion but remain one of the least studied artifacts of navigation history. The current state of research indicates that a detailed technical study of these charts is still in its infancy, leaving a significant knowledge gap about their provenance, development, and practical applications at sea.\n\nThis research seeks to address the following pivotal questions: What is the origin of the pre-Mercator nautical chart? How did the technical features of these charts evolve over time? In what ways were the charts used by mariners to navigate the oceans? To explore these questions, we will employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling, and the examination of manuscripts with special lighting techniques. Our objectives are to unveil any hidden graphic content, characterize the main geometric features of the charts, establish connections with contemporary navigational methods, and simulate the charts' construction numerically.\n\nBuilding on our previous work, which resolved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this research proposes to tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. The anticipated impact of this project extends beyond the History of Cartography to influence the intellectual history at large, as these nautical charts were instrumental in shaping the way early seafarers viewed and interacted with the world. The findings from this study are expected to provide significant insights into the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts, thus filling a critical gap in scholarly knowledge and understanding of our maritime past.\n\nKeywords: History of Cartography, nautical charts, medieval navigation, early modern seafaring, interdisciplinary research, cartometric analysis."
