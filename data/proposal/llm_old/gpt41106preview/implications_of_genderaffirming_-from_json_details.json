        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships of Transgender People\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to explore and understand the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on the psychosocial functioning and social relationship experiences of transgender individuals. Despite high rates of social disruption and suicide risk within this population, there is a critical lack of knowledge regarding the biopsychosocial outcomes of transgender people undergoing GAHT. Our study is situated at the forefront of transgender health research, aiming to address this gap by isolating causal pathways that link GAHT to improved psychosocial wellbeing and by documenting the nuanced social experiences of the transgender population.\n\nEmploying a biopsychosocial model, we will utilize a variety of novel and cutting-edge research methods over the course of four work packages to achieve our aims. These include: 1) identifying the causal mechanisms by which GAHT affects psychosocial functioning; 2) creating platforms for transgender individuals to articulate their personal and relational experiences; and 3) informing evidence-based policy and clinical practice to enhance the provision of gender identity services.\n\nOur informed consent model ensures ethical engagement with participants, while our outcomes focus emphasizes the improvement of both psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes. By delving into the psychosocial intricacies of GAHT, the project promises to not only advance scientific understanding but also to empower transgender individuals and guide stakeholders in creating supportive environments conducive to positive health and social integration."
