        "Abstract:\n\nThe NEUROEPIGENETHICS project seeks to explore the intricate relationship between epigenetics and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The research aims to understand how social and physical environments influence epigenetic modifications and contribute to the etiology of these conditions. With a focus on the ethical implications of these findings, the project endeavors to redefine traditional concepts of innate versus acquired traits and genetic versus environmental influences, incorporating a more nuanced biological and psychosocial perspective.\n\nBy employing both theoretical and empirical investigation methods, NEUROEPIGENETHICS will address the concept of 'responsibility' in the context of NDDs, distinguishing between 'capacity responsibility' and 'normative responsibility.' This distinction is crucial for persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families, as it impacts the perception of agency and moral accountability in individuals affected by these conditions.\n\nThe project's multidisciplinary approach will bring together insights from epigenetics and ethics to inform the professional stakeholders, including healthcare providers, educators, and policymakers, about the responsibilities toward individuals with NDDs. By integrating the latest scientific knowledge with ethical considerations, NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to foster a more compassionate and informed discourse surrounding neurodevelopmental disorders, promoting a society where individuals are recognized for their abilities rather than defined by their limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, NEUROEPIGENETHICS represents a pivotal step towards understanding the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in NDDs and the corresponding ethical responsibilities, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the lives of those affected by these conditions."
