        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\"\n\nThe proposed research project, \"The Praxis of Coexistence,\" aims to delve into the complexities and practicalities of ethno-religious coexistence by employing an empirical, inductive, and comparative methodology. The study will explore the intricacies of how diverse communities, specifically in Europe, the United States, India, and Israel, navigate and manage the challenges posed by religious and ethnic diversity. The primary focus will be on understanding the spontaneous practices that facilitate coexistence and the ways in which these practices can inform and improve policy-making.\n\nObjectives of the research include a thorough investigation of the mechanisms by which communities inherently understand and manage coexistence, an analysis intended to enlighten stakeholders about community expectations, and a comprehensive examination of the resources utilized to sustain civil relations and circumvent conflict. The approach is distinctly comparative and inductive, drawing on real-life examples of \"ordinary coexistence,\" which will provide a rich, grounded perspective often absent from theoretical discussions.\n\nThe goals of the project are twofold: to open a theoretical and normative space that recognizes and values diverse approaches to managing coexistence and to ensure that cultural contexts and existing practices are considered when addressing diversity dilemmas. The research questions guiding the study include inquiries into how communities spontaneously accommodate differences and what resources they employ to maintain peaceful coexistence and prevent conflict.\n\nThis research is poised to contribute significantly to the discourse on diversity, offering insights that can lead to more culturally sensitive and effective policies that respect and harness the power of local practices and wisdom in the realm of coexistence."
