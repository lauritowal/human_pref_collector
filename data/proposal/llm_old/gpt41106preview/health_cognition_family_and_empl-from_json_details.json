        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men\n\nThe proposed project seeks to investigate the complex interplay between men's health and cognition and their evolving roles in family and employment sectors. This research is prompted by the recognition of the higher premature mortality rate among men and the significant preventable excess mortality that could be mitigated through focused health and social interventions. The project aims to contribute to the gender equality goal by improving men's health outcomes and cognitive functions, thereby enhancing their participation in the labor market and their roles within families, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.\n\nThe study will explore the trends that have seen men lagging behind women in tertiary education and experiencing a slight decline in labor market participation, juxtaposed with the increased labor participation among women. Notably, the risk of job loss for men due to technological changes, along with the dramatic rise in male childlessness in Western countries, underscores the need for a deeper understanding of these issues. The project will also examine the increased involvement of fathers in childcare and how the shift from the traditional male breadwinner role is affecting men's health and cognitive development.\n\nThe research will focus on men's health and cognition in young adulthood and midlife, examining cohort and period differences, the work-life interface, the changing male breadwinner model, and fathers' participation in childcare. A mixed-method approach will be employed to disentangle issues of selection and causality, using Norwegian population data, including register, survey, and genetic data, alongside health measures and employment data. With a sample size of over 12,000 men ranging from late teens to 36-69 years of age, the study promises comprehensive insights into the cognitive trajectories of men.\n\nCurrent funding status for this project is pending, and the successful grant acquisition will be pivotal in executing this timely and critical research with significant implications for policy and intervention programs aimed at improving men's health and societal contributions.\n\n(Word Count: 300)"
