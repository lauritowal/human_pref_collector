        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged,\" aims to address the significant yet under-detected and moderately-treated issue of depression among the elderly, which has a prevalence rate of 1-3% for major depression and 8-16% for clinically significant symptoms. Insomnia, a risk factor prevalent in up to 40% of the elderly, increases the risk of depression by 13%. The project's priority is to establish a preventive intervention that targets insomnia to mitigate its detrimental impact on mood.\n\nThe objectives are to facilitate early identification of at-risk individuals, quantify the mechanisms by which insomnia exacerbates mood disorders, and enroll participants in tailored intervention protocols. The approach is to employ multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging for subtype identification, thus leveraging an interdisciplinary strategy. This cutting-edge method will yield outcomes including precise subtype profiling, in-depth understanding of underlying mechanisms, and the optimization of intervention protocols.\n\nThe intervention format is notably innovative, utilizing internet-supported resources that are applicable in the home setting, which will enhance accessibility and adherence among the elderly population. The project's prevention focus is squarely on sleep improvement, which is anticipated to concurrently prevent the onset or exacerbation of depression symptoms.\n\nThis project has the potential to significantly improve the detection and treatment rates of depression in the elderly by addressing insomnia as a modifiable risk factor. The findings could revolutionize the standard of care for the aged, aligning with both the scientific advancement and the humanitarian aspect of improving mental health and quality of life for this vulnerable demographic."
