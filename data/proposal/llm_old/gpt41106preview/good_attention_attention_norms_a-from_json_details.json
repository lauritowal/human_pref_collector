        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Good attention: Attention norms and their role in practical reason, epistemology, and ethics\" (GOODATTENTION) aims to pioneer an interdisciplinary investigation into the norms governing attention. Attention norms are ubiquitous yet under-theorized aspects that influence decision-making, knowledge acquisition, and ethical conduct. This grant proposal seeks to explore attention norms' emergence within individual psychology, their manifestation in social contexts, and their integration into normative philosophy.\n\nDrawing from a breadth of fields including Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Decision Theory, Epistemology, Ethics, Evolutionary Biology, Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology, Economics, and Political Theory, GOODATTENTION posits the hypothesis that the fundamental norms of attention revolve around the concept of relevance. The research activities are designed to: 1) Investigate the biological function of relevance processing, 2) Examine the role social relevance plays in how attention is steered by social norms, 3) Consider the influence of attention norms on relevance in decision-making, 4) Investigate the epistemic role of attention, and 5) Analyze ethical rights and duties regarding attention.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to provide a philosophical investigation of attention norms and to develop a framework for thinking about them. By adopting an interdisciplinary and ground-breaking approach, GOODATTENTION will delve into how attention norms are established and operationalized across various domains of human activity.\n\nThe expected impact of this research is twofold. Firstly, it will impact philosophical fields by integrating norms of attention into existing discussions, thereby opening new avenues of academic inquiry. Secondly, it will provide an analytical framework that can inform policy-making, with potential applications in areas such as education, technology design, and governance.\n\nIn summary, GOODATTENTION endeavors to develop a unified foundation for the study of attention norms through a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind, thereby enriching our understanding of human cognition and social interaction."
