        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nThis project aims to revolutionize our understanding of how humans comprehend other minds, challenging the traditional view that representing others' beliefs is effortful and develops late. We propose that the ability to monitor and represent mental states is not only automatic and effortless but also foundational to on-line cooperative social interactions. This assertion is motivated by a paradigm shift emerging from recent evidence that suggests infants as young as one year can understand mental states. Our own findings further advance this perspective by demonstrating that such mechanisms are present from as early as seven months of age and operate automatically in both infants and adults.\n\nThe project's core aim is to explore the empirical implications of these findings through a novel theoretical approach. We will investigate the functional structure and representational preconditions of mechanisms that infer the mental states of others. Particular focus will be placed on the functional sub-components and triggering conditions that enable infants' belief computation abilities and the developmental trajectory of these abilities. The research will delve into whether the system's proper domain is inherently tied to collaborative and communicative interactions.\n\nIn conducting this research, we will probe cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying the automatic processes that are integral to social mind functions. Our goals are to map out the developmental unfolding of these abilities and to explore their implications for social learning and collaboration.\n\nThis groundbreaking study will draw upon key references in the field, including foundational work by Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and forthcoming insights from Kovacs et al. (in press, Science). The proposed research promises to provide a deeper understanding of the representational capabilities that facilitate human social interaction and learning, with broad implications for fields ranging from developmental psychology to social neuroscience and education."
