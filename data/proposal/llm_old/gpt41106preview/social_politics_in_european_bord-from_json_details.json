        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, titled \"Social politics in European borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s,\" seeks to fundamentally reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by examining the roles of local actors and the co-construction of welfare systems. Focusing on three distinct yet comparably dynamic border regions—Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German borderlands—the study will cover the period from the 1870s through the 1990s, a timeline marked by profound political, social, and economic transformations.\n\nThe key concepts driving this inquiry include an investigation into the contributions of local actors, the interaction between public and private actors in the welfare domain, and the development of local welfare structures, all of which played pivotal roles in shaping national and non-national identities as well as cross-border solidarities. To achieve a comprehensive understanding, the research will integrate comparative analysis and transnational frameworks, thereby situating the local experience within broader European and global contexts.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of the study include an in-depth examination of the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, an understanding of the competitive landscape of social provision, and a tracing of the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. These outcomes promise to contribute significantly to the historical understanding of welfare as a field shaped by local actors and transnational influences.\n\nThe relevance of this research extends beyond historical scholarship by informing contemporary debates on welfare reform and addressing pressing social rights issues within Europe. By situating historical narratives in relation to present-day concerns, the project aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, social activists, and scholars interested in the evolution and future of welfare systems."
