        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,\" seeks to undertake a comprehensive historical and anthropological analysis of the visual documentation associated with the third plague pandemic that raged from 1855 to 1959, claiming over 12 million lives. The project aims to explore the breadth and depth of photography's influence on public perception and historical record during this period.\n\nThe third plague pandemic, with its substantial death toll and widespread geographical impact, offers a unique opportunity to examine the intersections of disease, society, and visual culture. The research will focus on diverse regions affected by the pandemic, including China and Japan, India, Africa, and the Americas. This global perspective will enable the team to analyze the role of visual representations in shaping understandings of the built environment, civil disturbances, burial practices, and public order, as well as issues of race, class, and discrimination magnified by the crisis.\n\nTo achieve the project's objectives, a team structure is proposed that includes one principal investigator and three postdoctoral researchers, all engaged on a full-time basis. The principal investigator will guide the project's overarching research strategy and synthesis, while the postdoctoral researchers will delve into specialized aspects of the analysis according to their expertise.\n\nBy focusing on visual representations, the project aims to illuminate how photography served as a critical tool in narrating the pandemic. It will assess how images contributed to the construction of social narratives and the ways in which they influenced public responses, policy decisions, and historical memory. The project's findings are expected to offer significant contributions to the fields of historical and anthropological scholarship, providing new insights into the complex interplay between visual media and the lived experiences of a global health crisis."
