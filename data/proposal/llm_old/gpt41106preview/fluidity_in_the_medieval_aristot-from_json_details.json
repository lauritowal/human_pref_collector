        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle. Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\" offers a comprehensive investigation into the reception and interpretation of Aristotle in the late medieval to early modern period. Focusing on the textual variance found in hundreds of manuscripts, this research aims to document the diverse ways in which translations of Aristotle’s works, particularly during the 12th and 13th centuries, were read and understood.\n\nThe project will address significant impact areas including philosophy, science, and theology, highlighting the intersection of these disciplines in the study of medieval intellectual history. Key to this study is the analysis of critical editions of treatises such as \"De anima,\" \"De generatione et corruptione,\" and \"De caelo.\" By meticulously documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses of these texts, the research will unravel the textual fluidity characteristic of handwritten books preserving Latin translations of Greek philosophy and science. This fluidity provides crucial evidence of how readers engaged with and interpreted Aristotle’s ideas in light of the translations that significantly diverged from the original Greek texts.\n\nThe main goal is to foster a deeper understanding of how the medieval and early modern intellectual community assimilated newly accessible knowledge. The innovation of this project lies in its approach to developing a novel model of interpretation that accounts for the dynamic and evolving nature of medieval translations and their reception.\n\nThis project promises to revise our conception of the transmission of Aristotle’s works and their influence on medieval thought. By recognizing the role of textual variance and the agency of readers in shaping intellectual culture, this research will offer a fresh perspective on the history of philosophy and science, and will enhance our understanding of the complex processes of knowledge formation and dissemination in pre-modern Europe."
