        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\" aims to decipher the complex interplay between adolescent development and social influence, which is pivotal for understanding academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. With the omnipresence of social media and the emergence of viral risk-taking challenges, it is crucial to comprehend how adolescents are shaped by their environment. The project's central goals are to develop a groundbreaking theoretical framework and formalize innovative computational models that capture the essence of social learning during adolescence.\n\nThis research is novel in its approach as it considers adolescents as active seekers of information rather than passive recipients. To achieve this, the project will develop new experimental tasks tailored to probe the decision-making processes within peer networks. By integrating these tasks with computational models and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the project will offer a unique lens to view the neural underpinnings of social information processing.\n\nFurthermore, the study will be conducted within actual peer social networks, providing an authentic context for examining social learning. Social network analyses will be employed to map out the influence patterns and learning dynamics within these networks.\n\nThe key research questions driving this investigation include understanding the critical moments when adolescents seek social information and identifying the sources from whom they prefer to learn. To answer these questions, a combination of novel tasks, computational models, fMRI, and social network analyses will be utilized.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are multi-fold. Primarily, it will provide deep insights into the role of social information in shaping adolescent behavior and advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social learning. Additionally, these insights will be instrumental in informing the development of targeted interventions that can foster positive developmental trajectories in adolescents. This proposal represents a significant step forward in the field of developmental neuroscience and has the potential to impact educational strategies and public health initiatives aimed at adolescents."
