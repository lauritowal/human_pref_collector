        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\" aims to investigate the multifaceted impact of technology on corporate governance, investor behavior, and employee welfare. The project is structured around three central pillars.\n\nPillar 1 focuses on the dynamic between corporations and their shareholders in the context of virtual-only shareholder meetings. Preliminary findings suggest that the shift to virtual meetings has curtailed open communication and enabled firms to selectively address shareholder queries. The proposed study aims to understand whether this trend is diluting shareholders' influence and if it reflects a broader change in corporate accountability.\n\nThe second pillar addresses environmental and social (ES) issues, concentrating on the discrepancy between firms' proclaimed and actual ES actions. With the application of natural language processing techniques, we intend to analyze corporate communications and their correlation with market behaviors. Initial results indicate that the market tends to reward firms simply for publicizing ES goals rather than for their real-world implementation. This research seeks to elucidate whether technology facilitates transparency or allows for a divergence between rhetoric and reality.\n\nFinally, the proposal examines how employee benefit compensation (EBC) relates to employee characteristics, with a specific focus on gender in the technology industry. This analysis aims to discern whether technology has altered the economic landscape to the advantage or disadvantage of certain demographics. The goal is to uncover any inherent biases and to propose solutions that could enhance the welfare of individuals within these corporations.\n\nThis comprehensive study stands to provide valuable insights into the evolving roles of technology in corporate practices, investor relations, and employee prosperity, with the potential to inform more equitable and effective policies in the business world."
