        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the \"Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\" project, an ambitious research initiative aimed at understanding the complex interplay between citizenship acquisition and migrant integration. The project's core objective is to model the legal status transitions of migrants as critical life course events, with a particular focus on how these transitions intersect with various aspects of societal integration such as employment, income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational achievement.\n\nRecognizing the pivotal role that policy plays in shaping migrants' trajectories, the project seeks to develop innovative methodologies capable of capturing the nuanced effects of policy variations on the step-to-citizenship pathways. Through the analysis of both longitudinal register-based and survey-based micro-data, the research will test theoretical models across eight diverse European and North American countries, encompassing a range of policy environments and migrant experiences.\n\nThe target population for this study includes immigrants and their children, with a view to generating findings that can directly inform the design and implementation of citizenship policies. By identifying the factors that facilitate successful integration, the project aims to provide policymakers with evidence-based recommendations to support migrants in their settlement process. Ultimately, the \"Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\" project aspires to contribute to a deeper understanding of how legal status and integration outcomes are intertwined, enabling societies to better accommodate the needs of their immigrant populations and to harness the potential benefits of diversity."
