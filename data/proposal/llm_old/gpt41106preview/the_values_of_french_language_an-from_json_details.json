        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\" is an interdisciplinary scholarly investigation aimed at reevaluating the usage and influence of the French language in Europe during the period 1100-1450. This proposal seeks to understand the historical relationship between language and identity, particularly how French functioned as a supralocal and transnational language amidst multilingual contexts where Latin and French were prominent non-local languages.\n\nOur research will address fundamental questions concerning the historical interplay between language and identity in Europe and the demarcation of cognate languages from each other. By focusing on this timeline, the project aims to contribute to the understanding of linguistic identity in medieval Europe, an era where language was a crucial component of cultural, political, and social life.\n\nThe project's goals include fostering collaboration between scholars from different traditions in Europe and North America, conducting empirical research on the textual tradition of the medieval chronicle 'L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César', and providing speculative reflection on linguistic identity through various methodological approaches. By employing codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, the research team will deeply analyze texts and contexts to uncover the broader implications of French language use in the Middle Ages.\n\nWith a team of scholars from European countries and North America, the project endeavors to connect diverse academic perspectives and methodologies. The ultimate aim is to interrogate the role of the French language in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages. This proposal requests funding to support the project's ambitious goal of reshaping our understanding of language's power to transcend boundaries and forge common identities in a period of rich cultural and linguistic diversity."
