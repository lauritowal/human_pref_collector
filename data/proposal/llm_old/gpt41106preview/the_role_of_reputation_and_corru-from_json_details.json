        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the intricate dynamics between reputation, corruption, and their collective impact on procurement processes across multiple vital sectors, namely defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The research is designed to fulfill overarching goals of minimizing waste, promoting social welfare, curbing corruption, and ensuring contractor compliance within public procurement systems.\n\nThe proposed study consists of three empirical components. The first component examines the influence of reputation mechanisms on procurement outcomes, specifically assessing how the implementation of a vendor rating system can affect contractor performance, procurement expenses, corruption concerns, and facilitate the entry of new bidders into the market. The second component delves into the pervasiveness of corruption within public procurement, evaluating the effectiveness of awarding rules in stymieing corruption, the extent of criminal networks, and the development of robust corruption detection tests. The final component offers a focused analysis of healthcare procurement regulations, providing a descriptive analysis of European Union practices, the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, and an evaluation from a patient welfare perspective.\n\nTogether, these components aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how reputation and corruption interact within the procurement sphere, and how this interaction subsequently influences economic and social outcomes. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to the design of more efficient, transparent, and accountable procurement systems, ultimately leading to better governance and public service delivery. The proposed research is poised to make a substantial contribution to policy discussions and help inform future regulations and reforms across the sectors involved."
