        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Mapping the impact of gut microbiota on brain and behaviour through the lens of GABA\n\nDespite sharing 99% genetic identity, humans exhibit profound individual differences in behavior and brain function, in part due to the 1% genetic variance and the distinct gut microbiota composition, which ranges from 40% to 90% uniqueness among individuals. With a bacteria-to-human cell ratio of 1:1 and a more striking bacteria-to-human DNA ratio of 10:1, the gut microbiota is a significant factor in human biology. This project proposes a novel exploration of how gut-produced neurotransmitters, particularly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), influence the brain and behavior. The knowledge gap addressed is the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters on brain function and behavior, with a biochemically informed focus on GABA, utilizing both direct and proxy assay methods.\n\nThe research will be conducted in two main work packages. Work Package 1 will investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABAergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults, using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure brain GABA levels. Work Package 2 will test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behavior over a four-week period, employing a custom-made probiotic intervention. \n\nThe overarching research goal is to understand the impact of gut bacteria and probiotics on brain GABA levels and function. This interdisciplinary project lies at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, and aims to advance the research frontier concerning individual differences in human behavior and brain function. By elucidating the relationship between gut microbiota and the brain's GABAergic system, this study has the potential to inform the development of novel probiotic treatments for neurological and psychiatric conditions, ultimately improving mental health and wellbeing on a broader scale."
