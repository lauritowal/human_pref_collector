        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\" aims to tackle the increasingly complex problems of cooperation in economic and social contexts. Recognizing cooperation as an essential component of a thriving economy and society, this project seeks to employ an economic engineering approach, as advocated by Nobel laureate Alvin Roth, to address the challenges posed by modern markets and societies that undermine cooperative behavior.\n\nThe methodology of this project is rooted in experimental methods and behavioral game theory, providing a robust framework for developing and testing solutions to enhance cooperation. The research is organized into three distinct work packages, each addressing a specific problem area.\n\nWork Package 1 focuses on electronic reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in the digital world. It addresses the challenge of flawed trust mechanisms on the Internet, which are critical for facilitating cooperative interactions among users.\n\nWork Package 2 aims to develop mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading. These races result in collective wastefulness and pose threats to market liquidity and stability. By mitigating such competitive escalations, the project strives to enhance market efficiency and cooperation.\n\nWork Package 3 is dedicated to creating market designs that are aligned with ethical considerations, using examples such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights. This package tackles the public's distaste for certain kinds of transactions and seeks to integrate ethical principles into market operations.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in the sciences of cooperation, and innovations in the application of behavioral economic engineering. Ultimately, this project aspires to contribute valuable insights and practical solutions for fostering cooperative behaviors, thereby enhancing the overall welfare and stability of economies and societies."
