        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" aspires to revolutionize the existing framework of moral advancement by constructing an innovative theory that transcends the limitations of our evolutionary heritage. Traditional accounts of moral progress, such as the 'expanding circle', are restricted by inherent biases like parochial empathy and kin-based altruism. Recognizing the need to move beyond these constraints, this proposal seeks to investigate diverse forms of moral progress and the potential of various moral attitudes that are not inherently subject to these evolutionary limits. A pivotal part of this exploration involves the identification and overcoming of ethically arbitrary features such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership that have historically curtailed the extension of moral concern. The ultimate goal is to engender a moral evolution that promotes an extended moral concern, unencumbered by these discriminatory facets. The proposed theory will place an emphasis on the design of 'smart institutions' capable of bypassing our psychological limitations and fostering a more inclusive and progressive moral landscape. This theoretical framework promises to provide a robust foundation for understanding moral progress and creating strategies for cultivating a more equitable and compassionate society."
