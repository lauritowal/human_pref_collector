        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition\n\nThis grant proposal centers on constructing a groundbreaking framework for understanding the multifaceted influences of reward on human cognition. The project is designed to delve into the intricate relationship between motivational factors and cognitive processes, such as conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. By placing a particular emphasis on the dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) neural systems, this research seeks to illuminate the underpinnings of various cognitive operations in both typical and atypical populations, including individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe core objectives of this project are to extend the current conceptual understanding of reward effects on cognition, to integrate diverse factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, and the influence of irrelevant information, and to employ advanced neuroimaging methods to probe neural activity and networks involved in these processes. By achieving these goals, the project promises to offer comprehensive insights that will enhance both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research.\n\nThe significance of the proposed research lies in its potential to elucidate the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind and to explore the disturbances in DA and NA systems that characterize various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The findings are anticipated to contribute to the development of more effective treatments and interventions that leverage motivational aspects of cognition.\n\nThis proposal represents an ambitious and innovative effort to synthesize a broad array of cognitive and neurobiological perspectives on reward and motivation, setting the stage for breakthroughs in our understanding of their essential roles in human mental functions."
