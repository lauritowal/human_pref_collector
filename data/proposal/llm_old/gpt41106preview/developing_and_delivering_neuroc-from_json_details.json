        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Developing and delivering neurocomputational models to bridge between brain and mind,\" seeks to advance the field of Cognitive Neuroscience by addressing critical questions about the nature and origins of mental processes and their corresponding neural machinery. The project's overarching aims are to deepen our understanding of mental processes, elucidate how these processes arise from neural systems, establish the basis of neurological patients' impairments, and enhance the clinical management and treatment of these patients.\n\nAt the heart of this proposal is an innovative approach that integrates complex investigations of mental behaviors with the mapping of neural systems and functions to develop novel methods and tools. The main activities include fostering the convergence of multiple disciplines such as experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies, as well as the development of a new type of neurocomputational model. These models are designed to mimic both normal and impaired behavior, connecting the dots between neuroanatomy and cognition.\n\nThe project's goals are ambitious and transformative: to secure reliable methods and tools for a systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience, to plan and execute neuroscience and cognitive methods in tandem, to force a convergence of results that will propel the field forward, and to provide a novel formalism for the integration of brain and cognition.\n\nThe proposed neurocomputational models are expected to offer a groundbreaking platform that will reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function while retaining the ability to simulate detailed cognitive behavior. If successful, the outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain-mind connection and significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological impairments through better-informed clinical interventions.\n\n(Project Limit: 293 words)"
