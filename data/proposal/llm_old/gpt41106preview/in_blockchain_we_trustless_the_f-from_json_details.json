        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\n\nThe BlockchainGov project is poised to pioneer the intersection of blockchain technology with governance systems. This forward-looking research initiative aims to dissect and understand the evolving landscape where technology, political science, and legal frameworks converge to shape community and global governance. Our ambitious objectives include an in-depth investigation of existing blockchain governance mechanisms, a critical analysis of the power dynamics they engender, and a comprehensive assessment of the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance models.\n\nThe research spans multiple disciplines, drawing on expertise in computer science, political science, and law to offer a holistic view of the transformative potential of blockchain technology in decision-making processes. The project will delve into the inner workings of current blockchain systems to glean insights into their governance structures, scrutinize the balance of power within these systems, and evaluate the credibility and long-term viability of decentralization as a governance paradigm.\n\nMoreover, the project will not only analyze but also actively experiment with new models of distributed governance across various levels, from local communities to international bodies. Through this practical engagement, BlockchainGov seeks to challenge the status quo and catalyze the development of innovative governance models that are transparent, equitable, and efficient.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include establishing a nascent field of scholarship in distributed governance, contributing empirical and theoretical knowledge to the scientific community, and informing policy-making on a global scale. To realize these ambitious goals, the project requires a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team, and a blend of multidisciplinary skills.\n\nBlockchainGov represents a crucial step towards a future where trustless mechanisms redefine the fabric of society, empowering communities and global entities through distributed, decentralized governance."
