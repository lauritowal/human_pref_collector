        "Abstract:\n\nThe STONECULT project, titled \"Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture?\" addresses the compelling and fundamental question: \"When did forms of culture first arise in our lineage?\" This research endeavor aims to unravel the origins of human culture, a critical component of our speciesâ€™ ability to colonize the planet. The prevailing assumption in anthropological and archaeological science posits that early hominin technology emerged from social learning mechanisms akin to those observed in modern humans. However, the STONECULT project challenges this notion by proposing an alternative hypothesis grounded in the latent solutions model, which may offer a more accurate explanation for the development of early stone tools.\n\nWith a meticulous comparative analysis involving modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, the research will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing methodologies to assess the validity of two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis that early stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture, and the alternative hypothesis that they are best accounted for by the latent solutions model. By investigating these early artifacts, STONECULT seeks to determine whether these tools reflect a burgeoning cumulative culture or if they represent isolated instances of problem-solving devoid of cultural accumulation.\n\nThe implications of STONECULT's findings are vast and transformative. Confirmation of the latent solutions model would suggest that the emergence of cumulative culture occurred later than currently believed, prompting a paradigm shift in our understanding of human cultural evolution. Such insights would profoundly inform interdisciplinary fields including anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology.\n\nThis grant proposal represents the first concerted effort to test the new latent solutions account of early stone tools and promises to reshape our comprehension of the evolutionary trajectory that led to the rich cultural tapestry characterizing humanity today."
