        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The new flow of news: how social network sites transform news organization and citizens political behavior,\" aims to investigate the seismic shift in the news industry marked by a decline in traditional news sources and a rise in attention toward social network sites (SNS). The project will explore the process by which news has become a social product and the implications this has for news organizations, content creators ('news feeders'), and consumers ('news feedees'). \n\nThe research intends to construct a new model based on network logic to understand and predict long-term effects on political beliefs and behavior. To achieve this, cutting-edge methods will be employed, including big data analysis, small N in-depth designs, and innovative approaches. The study will involve interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, and content analysis to understand news organizations' adaptation to this new landscape. Additionally, users' behavior will be assessed through laboratory observation, measurement of surfing behavior, and physiological attention indices.\n\nThe project is particularly concerned with the long-term political effects of this transition, and thus it will collect survey panel data and web-based behavioral data spanning two years. The research's impact is expected to be substantial, providing novel conceptualizations of news distribution, consumption, and influence. It will set a new methodological standard in audience research and contribute to the understanding of the role of SNS in shaping public opinion and political behavior.\n\nThe descriptions underscore that the project will provide a comprehensive look at how the integration of SNS into news platforms is not only affecting news production but also reshaping audiences’ political behavior. This research will fill critical knowledge gaps and offer significant insights for news organizations, policymakers, and civil society actors concerned with the health of democratic engagement and public discourse."
