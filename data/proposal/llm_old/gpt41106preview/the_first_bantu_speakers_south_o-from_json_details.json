        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change, and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a pioneering research project that aims to unravel the complexities surrounding the early Bantu-speaking communitiesâ€™ establishment and expansion in Central Africa during the Late Holocene. The project, entitled \"The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest,\" will employ a cross-disciplinary approach, integrating archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics to explore the confluence of human migration, language evolution, climate change, and the advent of agriculture.\n\nA significant focus will be on the timing, location, and nature of the earliest village communities, and their interactions with indigenous hunter-gatherer populations. The project will conduct fieldwork in strategic locations including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola to gather archaeological and archaeobotanical data, which will be complemented with palaeoenvironmental, archaeozoological, and genetic information to construct a comprehensive picture of subsistence strategies, diet, and habitat preferences of these early communities.\n\nThe research team will use lexical reconstruction methods in historical linguistics to elucidate the relationship between language and ancient subsistence and land-use practices. Phylogenetic modelling will contribute to understanding the dispersal patterns of Bantu-speaking populations, potentially driven by agricultural innovations. The project will address open questions that have political and cultural implications due to the controversy over the age of the Bantu language family and the political repercussions of historical migration patterns.\n\nWith an interuniversity collaboration framework, the proposed work aims to provide a holistic view of the factors that influenced the spread of the first Bantu speakers south of the rainforest, offering critical insights into one of the most significant migration events in prehistory, which shaped the linguistic and cultural landscape of Central Africa and beyond. The results are expected to have profound implications for our understanding of human societies' adaptability and resilience in the face of environmental change."
