        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability, and Rights\" (PRILA) aims to critically examine the European prison system with a focus on how mechanisms for securing prisoner rights and ensuring accountability are experienced, with the ultimate goal of achieving adherence to the rule of law. The project underscores the importance of fair treatment of prisoners, upholding their rights, and promoting just imprisonment conditions and good order within the correctional system.\n\nPRILA will address significant research gaps by exploring often-overlooked elements of accountability and the experiential dimensions of rights within prisons. It will document the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies, study the structures for fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making, and assess appeal and review processes in light of compliance with human rights principles. Through its activities, PRILA seeks to transform and extend our understanding of legitimacy in prisons, advance the judicial review of administrative actions, and enhance the comprehension of penal power experiences.\n\nThe project will be interdisciplinary, incorporating perspectives from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment. A combination of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods will be deployed to create a comprehensive account of accountability practices and examine accountability structures as manifestations of penal ideologies.\n\nPRILA's key objectives include creating an account of the accountability work experience within European prisons and examining how these structures serve as expressions of public and prison law values. The contributions of PRILA are anticipated to advance conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, support better penal policies and practices, and protect the rule of law and rights in prisons. Its distinctiveness lies in providing the first account of the European experience of penal concepts and their practical application within the prison context."
