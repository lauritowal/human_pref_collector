        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Florilegia Syriaca. The Intercultural Dissemination of Greek Christian Thought in Syriac and Arabic in the First Millennium CE\n\nThe proposed project, \"Florilegia Syriaca,\" seeks to explore the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought as it permeated Syriac and Arabic cultures during the first millennium CE. The focus is on the role of Syriac Christianity as a cultural mediator, addressing a significant gap in current scholarly knowledge. By illuminating lesser-known Syriac and Christian Arabic sources, the project's objectives include defining the religious identity of Syriac Christians, creating open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia, and studying the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors.\n\nThe primary strategy involves the production of florilegia, or anthologies, which served as cultural creativity laboratories during the patristic canon period of the 2nd-6th centuries. These anthologies were shared by both European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures, reflecting a rich intercultural exchange. The project's groundbreaking endeavors will focus on digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th-10th centuries and the study of neglected writings by Syriac and Christian Arabic authors of the 8th-11th centuries.\n\nExpected research outcomes include an improved understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity and the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge connecting the intellectual histories of Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, the study aims to impact the comprehension of Europe's current religious discourses and contribute to the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians.\n\nThrough this project, significant strides will be made in the academic and public understanding of a pivotal era of cultural and religious history, shedding light on the intercultural dissemination and transformation of Greek Christian thought across linguistic and cultural boundaries."
