        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity\" project, known as BabMed, embarks on the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. This groundbreaking research will focus on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as depicted in the Aramaic language of the Babylonian Talmud. BabMed challenges the conventional understanding of knowledge transfer in Late Antiquity, hypothesizing that cuneiform medical knowledge survived far longer than previously believed and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has its roots predominantly in Akkadian medicine.\n\nEmploying native taxonomies, the methodology of BabMed includes a comparison with neighbouring medical systems, while also addressing the prevalent Eurocentricity in current historical narratives, which typically favor standard comparisons with Greek medicine. BabMed proposes a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer, overcoming barriers such as script and language changes. It suggests that Babylonian medicine outlived the demise of the cuneiform script and was preserved, in part, in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmudâ€”a unique text providing unparalleled insight into the scientific thought of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia.\n\nThe BabMed project stands out as it represents the largest ancient collection of medical data before Hippocrates, offering a fresh and significant perspective on the scientific context of the era. This exploration of ancient medicine will not only contribute to our understanding of Babylonian cultural heritage but also challenge the Eurocentric biases within the historiography of medicine and science."
