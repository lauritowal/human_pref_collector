        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: South American Population History Revisited: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the Upper Amazon\n\nThis project aims to explore the intricate tapestry of South American population history by focusing on the linguistic diversity of the Upper Amazon region in western South America. Recognized for its complex sociohistorical layers, the Upper Amazon provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of linguistic diversity that reflects continental population dynamics. The project will utilize a multi-disciplinary approach to reconstruct and compare distinct layers of history—geographical, socio-historical, and communicative—to unearth historical events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade. These layers are critical in understanding the interaction between the region's ecology, human behavior, and cognitive processes.\n\nThe significance of linguistic diversity lies in its ability to illuminate past migrations and historical contacts between societies, thereby offering profound insights into human-environment interactions. The Upper Amazon exhibits diverse patterns of linguistic diversity, with the northern and southern regions displaying evidence of local language contact and old diversity patterns, while the central region is characterized by the dominance of three language families, each representing different stages of expansion into the area.\n\nEmploying a multi-disciplinary research approach, the findings from this project are expected to provide evidence of historical migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade. These findings will have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the social dynamics that have shaped linguistic diversity. Additionally, the project seeks to demonstrate the utility of linguistic diversity as a window into our collective past, offering a unique perspective on human history in the Upper Amazon.\n\nBy unraveling the complex relationship between language and human history in this region, the project will contribute to the broader field of anthropological linguistics and support the preservation of linguistic heritage for future generations."
