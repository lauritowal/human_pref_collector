        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal presents \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town,\" a pioneering project focused on Zarzis, Tunisia, with the aim of understanding the endpoint of various life cycles in the Mediterranean milieu. The town of Zarzis serves as a living laboratory where the intricate connections between life and the vital elements that sustain it can be observed and studied.\n\nThe project employs an innovative forensic approach to ethnography, treating it as an art that demands a meticulous attention to detail. Through this lens, the research will delve into case studies involving phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and the abandonment of industrial waste, to map and make sense of the conditions that make life untenable.\n\nA significant innovative aspect of this research is the decolonial shift in focus, redirecting the gaze from European-centric interpretations to the African context, thus challenging traditional narratives and power dynamics in academic research. The project also pioneers the development of forensic methods for ethnographic studies, and advances the concept of \"vital elements,\" which are fundamental to the existence and quality of life in the region.\n\nCollaborations are central to the methodology of this project. It includes team site visits that will provide real-world context, method lab work that will refine forensic techniques for ethnography, and partnerships with local artists through the Vital Elements Atelier, which will integrate creative perspectives into the research.\n\nIn summary, this project is not only an analysis of life conditions in Zarzis but also an exploration of the interrelations of resources essential to life, approached through a decolonial and attentive lens. It aims to contribute to the broader understanding of postcolonial realities and offers a novel methodology with potential applications in diverse anthropological and ethnographic studies."
