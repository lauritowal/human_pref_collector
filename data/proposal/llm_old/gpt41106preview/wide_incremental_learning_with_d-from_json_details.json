        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks\" (WIDE), aims to revolutionize our comprehension of language acquisition and processing by challenging the dominant Western linguistic paradigm that prioritizes alphabetic and phonetic systems. The project will delve into the rich linguistic landscape shaped over 50,000 years of human language evolution and 3,000 years since the invention of the alphabet, with a particular focus on the distinct characteristics of the Chinese writing system, such as character juxtaposition, contextual dependency, and syllabic construction.\n\nWIDE seeks to investigate how language understanding can transcend the traditional phoneme and word-based approaches. The research will employ wide learning networks, specifically two-layer networks with thousands of units, utilizing the simplest possible error-driven learning rules. The goal is to create network models whose performance aligns with human linguistic capabilities, embodying both strengths and weaknesses in auditory comprehension and speech production.\n\nBy incorporating the latest trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence, WIDE intends to advance research programs in auditory comprehension development, the modeling of diverse languages, speech production extension, and the development of discrimination-based language theories. The proposed methodology promises to offer new insights into literacy training, starting from early childhood, and how it is influenced by different writing systems.\n\nThe project calls for funding to support the exploration of these novel ideas and to contribute significantly to the field of linguistics and cognitive science. Through WIDE, we aim to establish a new understanding of language processing that reflects the complexities of human communication, transcending the constraints of traditional linguistic models and embracing the diversity of global language structures."
