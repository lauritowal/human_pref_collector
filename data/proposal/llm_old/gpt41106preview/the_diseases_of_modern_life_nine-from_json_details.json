        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"The Diseases of Modern Life: Nineteenth-Century Perspectives,\" aims to delve into the historical roots of contemporary health issues by examining the concerns surrounding stress, overload, and disorders associated with modernity in the nineteenth century. Drawing upon Benjamin Ward Richardson's seminal work, Diseases of Modern Life (1876), the project seeks to uncover the intricate ways in which literature, science, and medicine of the Victorian era grappled with the impact of a rapidly changing society on human health.\n\nThe project will focus on a range of areas including diseases from worry and mental strain, lifestyle diseases stemming from alcohol and narcotics abuse, effects of environmental pollution, financial speculation, professional life, middle-class addiction patterns, health-related travel, educational pressures, and the development of phobias and nervous disorders. Additionally, it will investigate the imaginative responses to these health issues through the construction of utopias and dystopias.\n\nThe objectives of the research are threefold: first, to track the circulation of ideas concerning health and disease across different domains; second, to explore the connections between physiological, psychological, and social well-being; and third, to contextualize the problems of modernity, offering new perspectives on how they have evolved over time.\n\nEmploying methodologies that reflect a holistic and integrative Victorian vision, the project will contribute to cross-disciplinary scholarship, bridging the gaps between historical, medical, and literary studies. By doing so, it is expected to break new ground in scholarship and offer breakthroughs in the compartmentalization of psychiatric, environmental, and literary history.\n\nThe grant funding is sought to support this innovative research, which promises to deepen our understanding of the historical context of modern health issues and provide valuable insights into the persistent challenges of balancing progress with well-being."
