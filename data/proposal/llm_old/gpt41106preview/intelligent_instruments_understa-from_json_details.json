        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\n\nThe proposed project aims to delve into the evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realm of musical creativity by developing intelligent musical instruments and exploring the dynamic between human musicians and AI systems. With a focus on how creative AI reshapes our perceptions of art, culture, and society, this project holds the promise to redefine human relationships with technology and each other.\n\nObjectives of this research include a thorough understanding of the changes brought by creative AI and examining its impact on human interactions. The project consists of work packages that involve the development of AI-infused musical instruments, investigation of human-AI collaboration in music production, and the novel use of these instruments as tools for scientific inquiry.\n\nOne of the primary goals is to spark a public conversation about creative AI and to construct a theoretical framework that addresses the transformed notions of self, others, and knowledge within this context. The interdisciplinary approach, combining music, philosophy, and computer science, facilitates a comprehensive research collaboration protocol that draws from a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines.\n\nOutcomes expected from this project include a deeper understanding of the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and its potential reflection in future societies. The project will also develop a theoretical framework for creative AI and initiate an essential discourse on human-centered approaches to AI.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) brings a unique blend of expertise in music, philosophy, and AI, providing the necessary academic leadership to steer the project. The nature of this project spans across technology development and humanities, aiming to yield benefits such as the establishment of ethical AI design principles in services and products.\n\nIn summary, this project uses music as a platform to foster public understanding of AI, setting the stage for a future where human creativity and artificial intelligence coalesce to redefine the cultural and social fabric of our society."
