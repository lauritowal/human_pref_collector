        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul,\" aims to illuminate the enigmatic history of the earliest modern human colonization outside Africa by c.50,000 years ago, with a particular focus on the pioneering 'open water' crossings required to reach Australasia. The research question central to this endeavor is to understand how the peopling of Australasia occurred, involving unprecedented seafaring activities.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to uncover the earliest evidence of seafaring and its implications on our understanding of human migration, social organization, and cognitive development. The project will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on expertise from fields such as Archaeology, Marine Geophysics, Hydrodynamics, and Archaeogenetics. Objectives include examining the logistics of early seafaring (When, Where, Who, How), researching the now-submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf, identifying potential submerged prehistoric sites, enhancing understanding of paleoshorelines and tidal regimes, and resolving demographic and dating questions using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome data.\n\nThe geographical focus will span from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia), with a methodology that combines offshore and onshore environmental research, as well as targeted archaeogenetic research. The expected outcomes are multifaceted: the proposal anticipates refining knowledge of both onshore and offshore environments, gaining a deeper understanding of human origins, acquiring insights into population dynamics and migration paths, elucidating knowledge of early seafaring technology, and providing information on the social organization and cognition of the colonizers.\n\nIn summary, this project aspires to tackle pivotal questions regarding human origins and migration, specifically the technological and cognitive aspects of seafaring, which played a crucial role in the successful colonization of Sahul. The research outcomes promise to make a significant contribution to the fields of archaeology and human history."
