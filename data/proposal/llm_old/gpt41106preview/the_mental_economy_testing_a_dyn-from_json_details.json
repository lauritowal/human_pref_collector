        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, HOMEOSTASIS, aims to revolutionize the understanding of working memory by developing a novel theoretical model that challenges the current focus on the system's maximum capacity. Traditional theories of working memory consider it a limited-capacity system, with a predominant limitation related to the absence of information. However, these theories neglect how working memory interacts with the visible, external world. The HOMEOSTASIS project introduces the concept of an \"internal mental economy,\" where the goal is not merely to maximize internal storage but to maintain perceptual homeostasis through a dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling.\n\nMotivated by the need to study working memory in concert with the world we perceive, the project hypothesizes that observers tend to minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature, instead relying on external visual cues available in the environment. To test this hypothesis, the project will utilize novel experimental paradigms that allow interaction with a physically present environment, enhanced by cutting-edge techniques including electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology. \n\nBeyond experimental innovation, the project will undertake a patient study focusing on individuals with restricted deficits to specific components of the proposed model. Furthermore, machine learning will be applied to discover biometric signatures in eye movements that correlate with perceptual homeostasis strategies. \n\nThe impact of the HOMEOSTASIS model is far-reaching. It has the potential to diagnose working memory disorders more accurately and to enhance our understanding of how individuals interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments. The project's findings will not only contribute to the basic science of cognitive function but also have practical implications for the design of tools and interfaces that are sensitive to the natural capacities and limitations of human cognition."
