        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\n\nThe proposed project, \"Rediscovering the Hidden Structure,\" aims to forge a new understanding of Roman legal culture during the critical period of Late Antiquity. Through meticulous analysis and scholarly collaboration, this project seeks to write a transformative history that will illuminate the complexities of legal text transmission, the motivations behind imperial legislation, and the enduring influence of classical jurists.\n\nThe project will delve into several focus areas, including the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation, to reveal the persistent high-level legal culture of the time. A key element of this research is the study of how legal texts were copied and disseminated, understanding the role classical jurists played, and analyzing emperors' legislation to comprehend their motivations and the relationship with works of earlier Roman jurists.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, the project will assemble three research teams, with a cross-disciplinary composition that will foster a rich and comprehensive approach to the subject matter. The activities planned include editing a collection of papyri and parchments, organizing workshops with leading European scholars, and culminating with a final international conference dedicated to discussing the findings and implications of the study on Late Antique legal culture.\n\nThe anticipated outputs of this project are substantial. They include a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book focusing on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference. These publications aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission, thus offering a fresh perspective on a foundational period that shaped the legal systems of the Western world.\n\nWith its innovative approach and commitment to scholarly excellence, \"Rediscovering the Hidden Structure\" promises to make a significant contribution to the field of ancient history, legal studies, and manuscript research, offering a new narrative of legal development and intellectual life in Late Antiquity."
