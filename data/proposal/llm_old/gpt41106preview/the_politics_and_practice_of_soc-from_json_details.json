        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict,\" seeks funding for a comprehensive five-year research project aimed at understanding the complex role of social media in regions experiencing protracted violent conflict. The project endeavors to extend Internet reach to some of the world's most remote and impoverished areas, with a specific focus on non-urban, conflict-affected communities in Africa, especially in Eastern Africa.\n\nThe central aim of this research is to elucidate the impact of social media access on the dynamics of conflict and peacebuilding. It seeks to answer pivotal questions regarding how social media can alter the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, how public authorities might use these platforms to either incite violence or foster peace, and how individuals' experiences with violent conflict are being reshaped in the digital age.\n\nThe research will examine various contexts, including the proliferation of dangerous speech online, the movement of individuals into and out of areas of conflict, the strategies used by different actors to shape Internet narratives, and the use of social media by governance actors. By investigating these areas, the project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between social media and conflict in Africa, with an emphasis on the intersection of religious and political violence in Eastern Africa.\n\nThis proposal targets key initiatives that strive to enable affordable Internet access in regions with weak state presence, thus contributing to the larger goal of bridging the digital divide and fostering an environment conducive to peace and stability. The research findings will be critical for policymakers, peacebuilding practitioners, and international development agencies aiming to design effective interventions in the digital age."
