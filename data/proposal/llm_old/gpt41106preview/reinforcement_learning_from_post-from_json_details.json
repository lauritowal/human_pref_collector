        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Reinforcement learning from post-ingestive calories: from body to brain in health and disease,\" aims to deepen our understanding of how post-ingestive reinforcement influences food-seeking behavior. The central hypothesis posits that this reinforcement has a dopaminergic substrate and is closely associated with neural activity within the brain's reward circuits. We propose to utilize a multidisciplinary approach, employing computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Our research will involve both rodent and human subjects, providing a comprehensive analysis across species. \n\nThe focus of the project is on the selection of food based on post-ingestive information, particularly the energy content and the role of the vagus nerve in transmitting this information to the brain. We will conduct experiments including human probabilistic decision-making tasks to assess the impact of post-ingestive reinforcement in different contexts of health and disease, with a specific interest in conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe project's findings will illuminate the underlying mechanisms of how the human body and brain respond to the caloric intake post-consumption, and how this response drives subsequent food-seeking behavior. This research has the potential to reveal novel insights into the modulation of eating behaviors by post-ingestive signals, which could have significant implications for understanding and treating obesity and other eating-related disorders. Through this innovative research, we aspire to bridge the gap between physiological responses to food intake and the associated behavioral outcomes, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies."
