        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work\" (CRAFTWORK), seeks to explore the intricate connections between personal identity and the nature of work through the lens of neo-craft workers across Europe. The project employs a multi-methodological approach, integrating both digital and qualitative research methods, to delve into the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of individuals engaged in various craft-based sectors.\n\nWith a focus on the EU, CRAFTWORK will study a range of research areas, including subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media. The goal is to create a new interpretative framework that can better elucidate the relationship between identity and work, particularly in the context of the rapidly evolving landscape of employment.\n\nCRAFTWORK is poised to be the first comprehensive inquiry into neo-craft work within the European Union, bringing empirical, methodological, and theoretical innovations to critical studies of new forms of work. Empirically, it will provide a broad panorama of the neo-craft sector, capturing the diversity of experiences and practices. Methodologically, it will pioneer the combination of digital methods with traditional qualitative research to yield rich, nuanced insights. Theoretically, it will challenge and expand existing interpretative categories, offering fresh perspectives on how individuals perceive and construct their identities in relation to their work.\n\nBy addressing the societal challenges associated with the future of work, CRAFTWORK will not only contribute to academic discourse but also inform policy-making and support the development of strategies to foster meaningful and sustainable work environments in the face of ongoing changes in the labor market."
