        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\n\nThe transformative journey of pregnancy extends beyond physical changes, eliciting profound modifications in brain structure and function. Our project aims to unravel the intricacies of this remarkable period of neuroplasticity. We propose to comprehensively map the evolution of brain anatomy and function from pre-conception through the postpartum period. Our objectives include identifying the key drivers of these pregnancy-related changes and distinguishing the neural underpinnings that may lead to adaptive benefits, such as enhanced maternal caregiving, or maladaptive consequences, including mental health disorders and memory issues.\n\nTo achieve our aims, we will conduct a prospective cohort study, meticulously tracking women across the stages of pregnancy. We will employ state-of-the-art neuroimaging technologies to observe alterations in brain structure and activity. Concurrently, psychopedagogic and biomedical measures will be utilized to assess behavioral and physiological correlates of neuroplasticity.\n\nOur research has the potential to lay the groundwork for an emerging field within human neuroscience, dedicated to understanding the neurobiological transition into motherhood. By elucidating the mechanisms of pregnancy-induced brain changes, we anticipate providing valuable insights that can inform interventions to support maternal mental health and optimize caregiving practices. This work will not only enhance scientific knowledge but also has the potential to benefit the wellbeing of mothers and their children worldwide, making it an endeavor of both academic significance and societal importance."
