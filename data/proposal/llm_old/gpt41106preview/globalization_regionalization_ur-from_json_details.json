        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century,\" aims to map and analyze the changing spatial pattern of the world economy through the lens of maritime history. Utilizing data from Lloyd's List register starting from 1734, the project endeavors to provide comprehensive insights into the progression of the global economic landscape over nearly three centuries, with an end year not specified to allow for ongoing research.\n\nThe main goal of this ambitious study is to map the spatial distribution of maritime flows, creating dynamic and interactive visualizations on a geomatics visualization platform, which will not only serve academic research but also enhance public understanding of maritime history. Alongside this, the project will utilize graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks to analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links. Comparative analysis with general models of networks will be performed, and macroscopic measures such as network expansion, shrinkage, concentration, and polarization will be investigated to understand the evolution of the global maritime network.\n\nFurthermore, the project seeks to study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development, focusing on the evolution of port cities and their hinterlands and the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. This will include data integration from global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions.\n\nBy analyzing vessel movement data, the project will shed light on how maritime flows have impacted the global economy and urban development, offering a unique perspective on globalization, regionalization, and urbanization processes. The findings of this research will significantly contribute to academic discourse in economic geography, maritime history, and global studies, while also providing valuable information for policymakers and economic developers."
