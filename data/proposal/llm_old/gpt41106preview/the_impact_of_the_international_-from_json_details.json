        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore how the international right to housing has influenced national legal discourse within the context of eviction litigation. The project will focus on a data-driven analysis of over 700,000 individuals affected by evictions across Europe during the financial crisis period of 2007-2011. By utilizing advanced data science methodologies, such as citation network analysis and machine learning, the research will delve into a vast corpus of 'legal big data' sourced from national supreme courts and lower-level courts.\n\nThe core objective of the project is to identify predictors within eviction case law that elucidate the interplay between national and international law, particularly in how the right to housing is conceptualized and operationalized. The proposal posits that a right to housing should be understood as a network of international rights that permeate national legal systems. Through the empirical analysis of case law data, the project will shed light on the legal mechanisms through which international norms are integrated into domestic legal practices, with specific attention to the dynamics of eviction litigation.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research are manifold. Not only will it pinpoint predictors of court decisions in eviction cases, enhancing the understanding of the impact of international human rights on national court rulings, but it will also provide a foundation for future projects exploring the influence of international norms in other areas of the law. By revealing patterns and relationships within legal texts and judgments, the project is poised to offer valuable insights to legal scholars, policymakers, and housing rights activists who seek to strengthen the enforcement of the right to housing.\n\nIn summary, this grant proposal represents an innovative approach to the intersection of international human rights and domestic legal systems, with the potential to make a significant contribution to the fields of law, housing rights, and data science."
