        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Towards a computational account of natural sequential behavior,\" seeks to forge a groundbreaking understanding of how humans perform everyday tasks involving complex sequences of actions, marked by perceptual uncertainty and action variability. Our endeavor is to develop sophisticated computational models that will allow us to identify and characterize the intricate interplay of perception, cognition, and action as they unfold in real time.\n\nThe project's objectives are twofold: firstly, to construct a detailed understanding and model of how individuals process sequential actions in the face of uncertain sensory information and inherent action variability, and secondly, to elucidate the internal and external costs and benefits that influence optimal sequential decision-making under such uncertainty. To achieve these goals, we propose a multi-disciplinary methodological approach that harmonizes behavioral experiments with an array of theoretical frameworks, including psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning.\n\nPractical tasks selected for study include classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and an everyday activity such as sandwich making, providing a rich spectrum of behaviors for analysis. The expected outcomes of this research include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, elucidation of beliefs about tasks, quantification of subjective costs and benefits including perceived effort, and insights into action variability.\n\nBuilding on our previous experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical modeling on an individual and trial-by-trial basis, this project promises to deliver a comprehensive computational account of natural sequential behavior. The findings will have significant implications for a wide range of fields, from robotics and artificial intelligence to cognitive science and psychology, ultimately enhancing our capacity to design systems and interventions that better align with human behaviors and decision-making processes."
