        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Meeting Darwin's last challenge: toward a global tree of human languages and genes\" aims to bridge the gap between the historical classification of species and populations through the rise of molecular biology, addressing a prediction made by Darwin himself. The project confronts the current challenge posed by the weaknesses of available language classification methods, notably the narrow scope of classical methods and the unreliability of mass comparison. By adopting a new method based on grammatical evidence, informed by advances in formal and typological linguistics, we aim to set unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, and to measure linguistic distances between remote populations.\n\nThe proposal underscores the significance of correspondence between language families and classical genetic markers, a concept supported by key advocates such as Sokal and Cavalli Sforza. Our innovative collaborative approach involves linguists and biologists working together to select significant populations for concurrent language and gene sampling. This synergy leverages the latest genetic tools from the past decade, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome markers, and mitochondrial DNA markers, paired with sophisticated biostatistical methods, to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.\n\nThis project is poised to make a groundbreaking contribution by describing the isomorphy between the trees of human languages and populations, fulfilling a quest that began with Darwin and establishing a new paradigm in the understanding of human diversity."
