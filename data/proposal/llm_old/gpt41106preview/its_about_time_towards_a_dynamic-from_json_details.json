        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\"\n\nThe traditional study of vision has largely been constrained to static and impoverished stimuli, neglecting the complexity of real-world visual experiences. The proposed project, \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of vision by studying it as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process that unfolds in natural settings.\n\nObjectives of this project include the study of vision in a more naturalistic context, with a focus on how visual processes are geared towards semantic understanding and involve active information sampling over multiple time frames. To achieve these objectives, the project will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing non-invasive human brain imaging techniques, novel multivariate analysis methods, and large-scale computational modeling. \n\nMethodologically, the project will involve the visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich, human-annotated natural scenes. This will be complemented by the development of new multivariate analysis techniques, as well as a bio-inspired deep learning framework that captures the dynamic nature of active vision.\n\nThe goals are to establish the temporal and spatial dynamics of how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain and to integrate this information into a continuously updating decision process. The anticipated impact of the project is a paradigm shift in the study, modeling, and understanding of vision. It promises to provide new insights into complex neural processes under ecologically valid conditions and foster a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision systems.\n\nIn summary, TIME proposes a pioneering approach to vision research that promises to unveil the intricate dance between the brain, the environment, and our perceptual experiences, marking a significant leap forward in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence."
