        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\nThe proposed project, The Formal Turn, seeks to elucidate the rise of formalism within the philosophy of science and logic during the first half of the twentieth century through an interdisciplinary and comparative approach. Formalism profoundly influenced mathematical, logical, and scientific methodologies, and this study aims to examine its early contributions in depth.\n\nThe project is structured into three distinct but interrelated subprojects: historical reconstruction, comparative study, and analysis of philosophical implications. The historical reconstruction subproject will investigate the period from 1860 to 1910, focusing on nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology. It will explore the foundational work of Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp, whose efforts laid the groundwork for later formalist developments.\n\nMoving forward to the period between 1920 and 1940, the comparative study will analyze the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism. Pivotal figures such as David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick will be examined to understand their roles in developing the formalist movement. This subproject will map the cross-pollination of ideas and the concurrent evolution of formalism across different domains of thought.\n\nLastly, the project will delve into the analysis of philosophical implications, assessing the impact of formalism on semantics in logic and philosophy, the philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. This subproject aims to articulate the broader philosophical significance of formalism and its enduring influence on contemporary thought.\n\nWith a methodological framework that synthesizes historical, comparative, and analytical approaches, The Formal Turn promises to provide an unprecedented understanding of the ascendancy of formalism in modern intellectual history, with outcomes that will be of great interest to scholars in the philosophy of science, logic, and beyond."
