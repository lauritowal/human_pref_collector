        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"The evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa\" (NGIPALAJEM) is a groundbreaking initiative designed to explore the significant and yet elusive period of modern Homo sapiens’ origins in Africa, dating back to 750,000 years ago. This research aims to illuminate a critical phase during which the Earth experienced the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), characterized by increased climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, beginning 1.4 million years ago and lasting for approximately one million years. This period also coincides with notable changes in the large mammal community at the end of the EMPT, providing a unique opportunity to study the interplay between human evolution and environmental pressures.\n\nFocusing on the Turkana region, renowned for its rich paleontological record, the NGIPALAJEM project endeavors to augment the hominin fossil record and enhance our understanding of the large vertebrate fossil record—key components in reconstructing the ancient landscapes that shaped human evolution. Our research goals include establishing empirical benchmarks to address fundamental questions about the phenotypic diversity of early Homo sapiens during the Middle Pleistocene and investigating the role of human predation in the evolution of modern African faunas.\n\nThe project will employ cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as novel morphometric methods and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses, to scrutinize the eco-morphological relationships across different sites and the new fossil discoveries, including the small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. These methodological advancements will enable us to refine the fossil record of the last million years, thereby contributing to a new understanding of human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape.\n\nWith the expected outcomes, the NGIPALAJEM project promises to redefine existing paradigms and generate a profound comprehension of early human history, addressing some of the most compelling questions in the study of our origins."
