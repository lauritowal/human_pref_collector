        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Students’ understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship Education\" (STUDACT) project is designed to critically examine the ways in which students engage with Global Citizenship Education (GCE) within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, targeting the year 2030. This project seeks to transform education systems, empower learners, and build peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies by fostering mutual understanding between indigenous and migrant populations. \n\nDespite expectations that students will incorporate GCE into their daily lives, research shows that challenges in developing GCE, building teacher capacity, and inconsistencies in theoretical approaches persist. A significant gap identified is the lack of systematic baseline data on how students understand and embody GCE principles. STUDACT posits the hypothesis that student engagement with GCE varies based on personal traits and contextual factors.\n\nThe project will gather data from six countries—Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK—employing innovative methodologies such as group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. This diverse approach will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of GCE policies and curricula across different levels of governance. The research questions aim to uncover the varying understandings and appropriations of GCE among students from different backgrounds, within and between different countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems. Additionally, the project will explore how student attitudes align with those inferred by international organisations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, and teachers.\n\nBy treating students as core partners and agentic participants, STUDACT is poised to offer groundbreaking insights into the role of GCE in shaping future global citizens. The findings are expected to contribute to refining educational strategies and fostering an environment where GCE can be effectively taught and practiced, leading to societal benefits that align with global education and development goals."
