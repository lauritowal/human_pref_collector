        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours,\" seeks funding to conduct a groundbreaking study in the field of Iron Age European Archaeology, focusing on the period from 800 BC to AD 100. The research is designed to shed light on the genetic makeup, population movements, social dynamics, and cultural connections of Iron Age communities in Britain within the context of their interactions with continental Europe.\n\nThe project will employ a suite of state-of-the-art methodologies including ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological, and cultural archaeological approaches. The primary objectives are to map genetic clusters, address questions of population movement, explore inter-regional connectivity, examine social dynamics, and investigate household compositions. The study will also identify familial relationships and gender-specific mobility patterns, as well as contribute to our understanding of the development of social inequalities during the Iron Age.\n\nThe research will analyze genome-wide data from 1,000 individuals in the UK and an additional 250 individuals from across Europe, making this the first study of its kind to perform genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. The expected outcomes include a new vision of Iron Age communities that will provide a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and potentially influence the broader field.\n\nThe team assembled for this project possesses expertise in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology. This interdisciplinary group ensures a comprehensive and scientifically robust approach to the research questions. The broader impact of the project lies in setting a new standard for archaeological investigations, providing invaluable insights into our shared past, and enhancing our understanding of the Iron Age societies that have shaped modern European cultural heritage."
