        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" aims to explore the critical role of organized labor in shaping care leave policies within the context of promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe. Recognizing the importance of social policies that support sustainable work through provisions for family and self-care time, this research will delve into the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections and how they intersect with gender dynamics, given women's predominance in caregiving roles and union membership.\n\nEmploying a mixed-method research design that includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis, the study will examine the scope of care leave policies in rich democracies since 1965 through quantitative analysis, while also conducting in-depth qualitative analysis in three specific countries: Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. This will provide a comprehensive view of the various care leave policies, including child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits.\n\nBy investigating the mechanisms of union influence within different institutional settings, the project seeks to contribute to comparative policy analysis and social movement research. The ambition is to advance comparative labour studies and develop robust theories on the relationships between unions and policy-making processes.\n\nThe research will also focus on building a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions, which will be essential for assessing the outcome of organized labor's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. Overall, the project will provide valuable insights into how trade unions can effectively advocate for policies that ensure a balance between work and caretaking responsibilities, thereby promoting gender equality and the well-being of workers across Europe."
