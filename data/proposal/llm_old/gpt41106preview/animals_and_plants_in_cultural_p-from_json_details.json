        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" aims to explore the dynamic relationship between non-human beings and human cultural life as depicted in various mediums such as literature, cinema, and art focusing on the Amazon. Grounded in the nascent concept of zoophytography, the study hypothesizes that cultural productions about the Amazon lend a unique voice to its animals and plants, thus influencing human understanding and interaction with the region's rich biodiversity.\n\nThe project is structured around three research streams. Stream I, \"Amazonian Zoophytography,\" will work to formulate a definition of the concept, examining its roots in both Indigenous riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy. Stream II, \"Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out,\" will delve into the specific ways animals are articulated within cultural productions. Stream III, \"Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations,\" will focus on the representation of plant life in creative works.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research will contribute to fields including environmental humanities, ecocriticism with an Amazonian perspective, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of Amazonian fauna and flora with human culture, recognition of the mutual dependencies between humans and non-humans, heightened awareness of environmental degradation in the Amazon, and the development of more equitable views concerning Amazonian ecosystems.\n\nBy employing the concept of zoophytography, the project, ECO, aims to decentralize humanity's role in meaning-making and to illuminate the often-overlooked narratives of non-human beings in the Amazon River Basin. This research promises to offer new insights into the interrelation between culture and nature, advocating for a more inclusive and holistic approach to understanding the Amazon and its global significance."
