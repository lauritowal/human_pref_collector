        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry (Project STARTDIALOG)\n\nAristotelian diagrams, as visual representations of logical relations, play a critical yet underexplored role in various scientific and philosophical disciplines. The STARTDIALOG project aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams to enhance our understanding of their logical properties and heuristic potential. This initiative addresses existing gaps in the literature, which currently lacks a systematic typology of these diagrams and fails to appreciate their methodological significance.\n\nBy creating a comprehensive database of Aristotelian diagrams, STARTDIALOG will facilitate a robust analysis of these visual tools. The research will be grounded in a multidisciplinary approach that leverages insights from philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. These fields stand to benefit from the project's outcomes, which include a clarified theoretical understanding of logical geometry and new appreciation for the diagrams' independent importance.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the STARTDIALOG project are multifaceted. They involve solving current issues in logical geometry, establishing an accurate understanding of the methodological importance of Aristotelian diagrams, and promoting the study of these diagrams as objects of independent scholarly interest. As a result, the project promises to deliver a breakthrough in logical geometry with significant relevance for philosophical logicians and applications across various disciplines.\n\nUltimately, the STARTDIALOG project will enable scholars to harness the full potential of Aristotelian diagrams, enriching the intellectual landscape of logical geometry and providing valuable tools for interdisciplinary research. With its innovative and integrative strategy, the project will forge new pathways in the understanding of visual representations in logical discourse, enhancing both theoretical and practical applications."
