        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\nThe STRADA project proposes the creation of an innovative dynamic computer-based simulation system designed to enhance our understanding of ancient transport and economic cohesion within the Roman Empire. With a focus on the crucial connection between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube, our objectives are to develop a simulation that integrates historical research with experimental data, analyze the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, and assess the impact of environmental factors on transport systems of the past.\n\nOur research will reconstruct ancient land and water routes, experimentally determine the performance of historical means of transport under varying environmental conditions, and develop a time-sensitive simulation system. The simulation system will feature local fine granular topography, historical weather patterns, a variety of transport means with differing load capacities, actor fatigue, and necessary rest and loading times. This modularly designed system will allow for sustainable use and future expansion, making it a long-term asset for historical research.\n\nThe STRADA project will cover diverse geographical regions, including the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and the Central European river landscape, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the varied terrains that ancient transport would have encountered. With a design approach that allows for adaptability and growth, our project will introduce dynamic simulations into the historical research field, offering a new dimension to our understanding of ancient logistics and mobility.\n\nBy achieving these goals, STRADA will not only provide insights into the economic integration of the Roman Empire but will also set a precedent for the use of dynamic simulations in the study of historical transport and economic systems."
