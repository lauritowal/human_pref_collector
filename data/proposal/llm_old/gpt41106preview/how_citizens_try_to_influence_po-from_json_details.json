        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed grant project, \"How citizens try to influence politics and why: International comparisons of movement and party politics,\" aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of political participation across different societal contexts. With a focus on both contentious and non-contentious political activities, the project seeks to understand the nuances of how individuals engage in or abstain from the political process within democratic societies. The study will encompass a range of focus areas including contentious politics, party politics, and the overall landscape of political participation.\n\nEmploying a diverse set of methodologies such as meta-analysis, global survey data comparisons, focus group discussions, and experimental focused surveys, the project is structured to offer a multifaceted approach to data collection and analysis. The objectives are to elucidate the reasons behind individuals' political engagement or lack thereof, to investigate the causes of various forms of political participation, and to explore the complex interactions between individual attitudes, organizational influences, and broader societal dynamics.\n\nThe research will be conducted in a comparative context involving countries with varied political climates, including The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina. This international perspective will enable researchers to identify patterns and differences that transcend national boundaries.\n\nThe project is divided into four subprojects: (1) a meta-analysis that synthesizes existing literature on movement and party politics, (2) a comparative analysis of historical survey data on political participation, (3) focus group discussions aimed at understanding the roots of political engagement and disengagement, and (4) experimental surveys targeting 1000 respondents in each of the eight countries to measure current patterns of political participation.\n\nBy combining theoretical and empirical insights, the project promises to contribute significantly to the understanding of political engagement in contemporary democracies. The findings are expected to provide valuable information for policymakers, political organizations, and civil society groups aiming to foster more inclusive and responsive political environments."
