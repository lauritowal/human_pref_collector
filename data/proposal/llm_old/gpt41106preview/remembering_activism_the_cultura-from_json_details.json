        "Abstract:\n\n**Title: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe**\n\nThe proposed project, aptly named ReAct, aims to pioneer a comprehensive analysis of how activism has been remembered and forgotten across Europe since the late 19th century. This exploratory study seeks to uncover the persistent patterns and transformations in the portrayal of protest movements within various media landscapes over three critical historical junctures: from 1871 to 1914, the 1960s, and the period of 2011-2012. ReAct aspires to reveal the intricate ways in which texts, images, and commemorative practices have played pivotal roles in shaping the collective memory of activism and analyze how these memories resonate and influence subsequent generations of protest movements.\n\nEmploying an innovative methodology, ReAct will utilize network visualization techniques to trace the propagation of protest narratives and references, thus offering novel insights into the mediation, legacies, and memoryscapes of social activism. The research will be divided into three distinct lines of inquiry, namely mediation (the role of media in shaping protest memory), afterlives (the persistence of protest memory over time), and memoryscapes (the spatial dimensions of protest memory).\n\nThe project's implications are profound. It promises a significant shift in the study of cultural memory, equipping scholars with analytical tools designed to decode the cultural transmission of collective aspirations such as hope. Furthermore, ReAct is set to inaugurate a new frontier in social movement research by providing a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between collective memory and identity. Through these endeavors, the project will also offer critical literacies that empower both academics and the public to re-contextualize and critically engage with the collective memories that shape contemporary social and political landscapes.\n\nReAct not only represents an ambitious academic endeavor but also a crucial step towards rethinking the cultural dimensions of protest and activism in Europe, with potentially transformative implications for society at large."
