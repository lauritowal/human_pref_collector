        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal entitled \"The multisensory mind: From neural mechanisms to cognition\" seeks funding to advance the understanding of multisensory integration (MI) â€“ the neurological process by which humans combine sensory information from different modalities. The project is poised to dissect the neural and neurochemical underpinnings of MI by employing state-of-the-art research methods, including human electroencephalogram (EEG) data collection, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\nThe primary objectives are two-fold: firstly, to examine the neural and neurochemical markers of MI, and secondly, to test a novel hypothesis concerning the synchronization of neural populations in the process of multisensory perception. This research will engage two participant groups, healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, to achieve a comparative understanding of MI in diverse populations. Schizophrenia patients are specifically included due to their often-documented deficits in MI, providing a critical perspective on the disruptions to normal sensory integration.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant as it aims to deepen the fundamental understanding of how the mind weaves together disparate sensory inputs to form a coherent view of the world. Beyond theoretical insights, the findings hold potential applications in the development of innovative treatments for conditions characterized by impaired MI, including schizophrenia. The proposal outlines a clear and methodical approach to exploring the complex dynamics of the multisensory mind, with the promise of making substantial contributions to the fields of cognitive neuroscience and mental health."
