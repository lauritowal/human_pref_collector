        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\" embarks on a groundbreaking journey to uncover the origins and mechanisms of animal domestication during the Neolithic period. With a concentrated research focus on the early evidence of sheep and goat management, this study will employ cutting-edge biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth to draw new insights into the transformative practices employed by ancient human societies.\n\nThe core of this research lies in examining the control of animals’ reproductive cycles, the alterations to their feeding habits, and the interruption of their natural migratory-seasonal movements. By analyzing faunal assemblages, comparisons with wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers, the study aims to bridge the knowledge gap concerning the inception of animal domestication processes.\n\nThe project will concentrate on key regions that have been pivotal in early agricultural and domestication practices: the Southern Levant, the Northern Levant, and the Eastern Fertile Crescent. This geographical diversification ensures a comprehensive understanding of regional variations and practices.\n\nThe overarching goal of this endeavor is to unravel existing paradigms regarding the origin of animal domesticates. It seeks to identify precisely how human societies have influenced and changed animals through domestication and to discover the early management practices related to caprine species. By establishing when and where the domestication processes began, the project promises to offer significant contributions to the fields of archaeology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology.\n\nWith its methodological rigor and interdisciplinary approach, the project stands to redefine our perception of human-animal relationships in the Neolithic era and provide a clearer picture of the dawn of animal husbandry, a pivotal moment in human history."
