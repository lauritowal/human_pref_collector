        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE (MEGAMAPS)\n\nThe MEGAMAPS project is a pioneering research initiative dedicated to charting the landscape of 'Artivism'—the intersection of art and activism—focused on gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, particularly in the post-uprising period after 2011. This transnational in-depth study encompasses Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia and aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region by writing a 'history from below'. The project investigates the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change, with the goal of framing, exploring, and mapping the emergence of Artivism for gender equality.\n\nEmploying a multidisciplinary approach, MEGAMAPS integrates methodologies from History, Social Movements Theory, Gender studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities. The research strategies include fieldwork and digital ethnography, engaging with living sources such as visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, maps, and graphic tools.\n\nOne of the core objectives is to produce an open-access participative digital platform that documents and systematizes a corpus of living sources, making it FAIRly (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) accessible to various audiences, including academics, stakeholders, and the general public. The platform will serve as the first research tool for exploring Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region, innovating traditional approaches to History and Social Movements Theory.\n\nMEGAMAPS will also conduct dissemination activities to improve activists' participation in transnational networks, promote mutual exchanges of best practices, and contribute to reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities. By proposing an agency paradigm, MEGAMAPS seeks to overcome orientalism and islamophobia, fostering a more nuanced understanding of gender Artivism's role in shaping the future of the Mediterranean Arab public space."
