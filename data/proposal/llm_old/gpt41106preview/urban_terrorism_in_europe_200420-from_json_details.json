        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive study of the societal and cultural aftermath of over ten major terrorist attacks that occurred in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany between 2004 and 2019. These egregious acts resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries, leaving deep scars on the urban landscapes and collective consciousness of these nations.\n\nThe project will utilize interdisciplinary approaches, including memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, to explore how communities engage with the processes of forgetting, remembering, and imagining in the wake of urban terrorism. The objectives are to analyze collective forms of memory, develop a new materialist approach to understanding terrorism, assess the effectiveness of current policies and security infrastructures, and employ performance art to create alternative forms of commemoration and future-oriented narratives.\n\nThe expected outputs from this research include the establishment of a dedicated website featuring interviews and resources, the publication of two academic monographs, multiple peer-reviewed journal articles, and a co-edited volume that encapsulates the findings of this study. Furthermore, the project will contribute to the academic community through the production of two PhD theses and engage the public through performances orchestrated by the ‘Center for Political Beauty.’\n\nUltimately, \"UrbTerr\" will present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of memory discourses in response to urban terrorism in the selected European countries. By documenting and interpreting the complex web of remembering and forgetting, this project will offer valuable insights into the cultural dimensions of terrorism and the resilience of urban communities, potentially influencing future policy and contributing to the formation of a more secure and cohesive European society."
