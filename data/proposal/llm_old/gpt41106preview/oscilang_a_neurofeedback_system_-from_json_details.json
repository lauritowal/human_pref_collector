        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'OsciLang' project proposes the development of an innovative neurofeedback system designed to detect and treat language disorders such as dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). This project aims to create an affordable, wearable brain-computer interface that leverages the latest advances in our understanding of the brain's oscillatory activity and its role in language processing. The system's core function is to diagnose and measure deficiencies in language processing by synchronizing the brain’s activity with changes in the speech signal. This mechanism is predicated on research that has identified reduced auditory tracking in the delta band among dyslexic readers.\n\nThe neurofeedback approach is based on the phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech, an innovative concept that represents a significant departure from traditional language intervention tools. By providing real-time feedback on brain activity via an EEG interface, the system allows users to facilitate top-down control over specific activation patterns. This interaction is expected to improve literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia by enhancing their brain-speech tracking capabilities, particularly in challenging, noisy environments.\n\nMonitoring parameters will focus on phase coherence at the theta and delta bands, key indicators of auditory processing and language comprehension. As a user-friendly tool, 'OsciLang' will quantify these basic parameters of brain activity, empowering users to engage with their own cognitive processes actively.\n\nThe expected outcome of the project is not only the provision of a novel tool for the diagnosis and intervention in language disorders but also the potential extension of this technology to a broader population. By establishing a framework for enhancing reading abilities, 'OsciLang' could have a transformative effect on the lives of individuals with language and reading impairments, contributing to their educational success and overall quality of life."
