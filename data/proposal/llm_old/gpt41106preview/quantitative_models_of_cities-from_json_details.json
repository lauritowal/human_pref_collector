        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Quantitative Models of Cities,\" aims to advance our understanding of economic divergence in urban environments, with a focus on the variances observed across and within countries, and between cities and rural areas. Recognizing the significance of the 20th century as a historical niche of interest, this research will leverage recent advancements, including the availability of high-resolution data and theoretical breakthroughs, to investigate urban economic phenomena.\n\nDrawing from influential works by scholars such as Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015), and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), the project's innovative approach lies in the integration of quantitative models with extensive register data. This combination will facilitate the development of a dynamic model that is both reflective of contemporary urban economic realities and grounded in historical data. A key feature of this dynamic model is its incorporation of worker and firm heterogeneity, which will enhance the precision and applicability of its findings.\n\nThe utilization of detailed Danish data sets the stage for a case study that is both specific and generalizable, with the potential to reveal patterns and insights applicable to other contexts. The project is designed to address policy-relevant questions that impact urban living and governance. Specifically, it will analyze the effects of urban transport infrastructure, the implications of height restrictions, and the outcomes of planning interventions on city development and dynamics.\n\nBy exploring these critical areas, the project not only aims to contribute to the academic discourse but also seeks to offer empirical evidence that can inform policymakers. The ultimate goal is to improve urban planning and policy, enhancing the economic prospects and quality of life for city dwellers and potentially mitigating the economic divergence that characterizes modern urbanization."
