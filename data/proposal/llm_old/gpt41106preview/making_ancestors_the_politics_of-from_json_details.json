        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking study entitled \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe,\" which aims to rethink the established narratives surrounding politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe. Challenging traditional views that consider inequality as a rigid and overt structure, this research proposes a new perspective that perceives inequality as situational, dynamically manifesting through the treatment of the dead.\n\nThe project will employ innovative methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy to empirically test this theoretical framework. By analyzing 200 individuals from three key periods in Peninsular Italy—Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC)—the study seeks to evaluate how inequality affected the lives of prehistoric communities. Specifically, the research will focus on understanding the role of ancestors in these societies and the weight of ancestral politics.\n\nThe research goals include a comprehensive evaluation of how deathways reflect social stratification and the construction of power dynamics within prehistoric communities. The project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the intersection between death and social inequality, reshaping our comprehension of prehistoric European societies.\n\nBy scrutinizing alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways, this research promises to offer a significant contribution to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, shedding light on the complex social landscapes of our ancestors and the political significance of their burial practices. The insights gained from this study have the potential to redefine scholarly discourse on prehistoric social organization and the evolution of socio-political structures."
