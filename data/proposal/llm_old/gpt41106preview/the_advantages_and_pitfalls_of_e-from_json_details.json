        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement,\" seeks to explore the dynamics of user engagement generated through calls to action (CTAs) on websites, and its implications for both businesses and society. The research aims to deepen our understanding of how CTAs influence user behavior, the direct economic benefits they bring to businesses, and their broader societal effects.\n\nAdopting an empirical approach that integrates both laboratory and field experiments, the project will scrutinize the efficacy of CTAs across various product domains and unravel the psychological mechanisms that drive user responses to such prompts. Preliminary results already indicate that CTAs can significantly increase user conversion rates and information disclosure, hinting at their powerful role in online environments.\n\nThe study will be conducted in collaboration with a leading website-development service provider operating on a freemium business model, ensuring practical relevance and applicability of the findings. By characterizing the effects of CTAs and the underlying behavioral drivers, the project objectives include not only understanding the phenomenon of user engagement elicitation but also measuring its value to business strategies and assessing its cumulative impact on societal norms and expectations.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this research is twofold: economically, it will contribute to the understanding of social computing in business contexts; societally, it will offer insights into how digital communication strategies shape user behavior and expectations. This comprehensive analysis of elicitated online user engagement will be invaluable for businesses aiming to optimize their online presence and for policymakers seeking to regulate the digital economy effectively."
