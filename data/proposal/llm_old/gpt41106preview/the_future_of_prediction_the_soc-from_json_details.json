        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine, and Policing\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to explore the burgeoning intersection of Big Data, Machine Learning, and digital forecasting within the realms of social sciences, particularly focusing on its impact on insurance, medicine, and policing. As algorithmic prediction becomes more prevalent, the project will critically assess the shift from traditional probabilistic methods to advanced algorithmic techniques in managing uncertainty and forecasting future events.\n\nThis interdisciplinary study will be situated within three primary research areas: personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing. Personalized insurance models, which rely on individual data to tailor policies, challenge the mutualization principle that underpins the insurance industry. In precision medicine, algorithmic predictions promise to enhance treatment efficacy but raise concerns about the potential for bias and the implications of data privacy. Predictive policing utilizes data analysis to anticipate crimes, which may blur the line between prevention and repression and exacerbate issues of bias and discrimination.\n\nThe project aims to tackle the individualization of prediction and its social consequences, examining how these advanced predictive methods could undermine collective strategies for risk management. A critical analysis of the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods will be conducted to understand how these two approaches can be effectively integrated while addressing the inherent problem of bias in algorithmic systems.\n\nUltimately, this research will provide a comprehensive investigation of the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and its wide-ranging consequences for social institutions. The findings will contribute to the understanding of how digital forecasting transforms social practices and will inform policymakers and industry leaders about the implications of embracing these technologies. The project's overarching goal is to foster a nuanced debate about the role of algorithmic prediction in shaping the future of societal decision-making processes."
