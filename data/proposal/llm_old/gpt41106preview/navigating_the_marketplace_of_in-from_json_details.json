        "Abstract:\n\nThe complexity of navigating the ever-expanding sea of country performance indicators (CPIs) poses a significant challenge for policymakers and stakeholders across various policy fields. Our project, \"Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators,\" seeks to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive analysis of how users and producers of CPIs adapt to the profusion of these indicators within the policy domains of education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness.\n\nCPIs serve as critical tools for simplifying country performances into quantifiable metrics that inform decision-making. However, the paradox of CPIs is that while they aim to simplify and clarify, the sheer number and diversity of these indicators often result in greater complexity. This complexity hinders the effective use of CPIs by practitioners who seek to benchmark and improve country performance across the aforementioned policy fields.\n\nIdentifying a gap in current research, our project proposes to undertake a systemic and longitudinal study to understand the navigational strategies employed by both the users and producers of CPIs. Drawing inspiration from the \"marketplace of ideas\" framework, we aim to explore how criticism and feedback on CPIs contribute to learning and adaptation among users, and how producers respond to competition within crowded policy fields.\n\nThe focus of this study is twofold: firstly, to examine how users of CPIs adapt their decision-making processes when faced with diverse and sometimes conflicting indicators, and secondly, to analyze the competitive dynamics among CPI producers as they vie for influence and relevance in saturated markets.\n\nOur research aims to advance the systematic understanding of CPI usage and production, ultimately contributing to a shift in how these indicators are navigated within the complex environment of policy-making. The insights garnered from this study will be invaluable for improving the efficacy of CPIs in guiding both national and international policy decisions.\n\nKeywords: Country Performance Indicators (CPIs), Policy Fields, Marketplace of Ideas, Systemic Analysis, Longitudinal Study, Policy-Making."
