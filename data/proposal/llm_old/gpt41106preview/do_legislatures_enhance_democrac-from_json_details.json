        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nThis grant proposal presents an innovative research project aimed at scrutinizing the function of legislatures within African electoral authoritarian regimes to determine their potential role in advancing democracy. The central research question addresses whether legislatures in authoritarian countries can indeed contribute to the democratization process. The project is rooted in contrasting theoretical views that elections and multi-party systems either serve to prolong autocratic rule or incrementally foster democratization over successive electoral cycles.\n\nThe objective is to thoroughly investigate the role of legislatures as law-making bodies, their interaction patterns and political dialogue, and the extent of their representation and responsiveness to constituencies. The study will confront the inherent challenges posed by the opacity of authoritarian regimes and the scarcity of research specifically focused on African contexts.\n\nEmploying a Mixed Methods-Design, the project will incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data types, utilizing a range of analysis techniques. These include content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. Parliamentary debates will be rigorously examined through content analysis, while national assemblies will be surveyed to gather biographical, opinion, and social interactions data among legislators.\n\nThe research will encompass seven African countries, selected for their varied experiences with electoral authoritarianism, providing a comparative perspective. Data collection efforts will be supported by a robust team of partner institutions across these nations, ensuring access to local insights and enhancing the validity of findings.\n\nThe proposal promises to make a significant scholarly contribution by amassing extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies. The outcomes are expected to illuminate the complexities of legislative functions in authoritarian contexts and provide a deeper understanding of their potential impact on democratic transitions in Africa.\n\nKeywords: Legislatures, Democracy, Africa, Authoritarian Regimes, Electoral Systems, Mixed Methods."
