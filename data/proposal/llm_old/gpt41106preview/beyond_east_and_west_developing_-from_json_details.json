        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\" aims to fuse Turkey's rich musical heritage with contemporary concert music, fostering a dynamic synthesis that transcends cultural barriers. Located in Turkey, this innovative initiative has multiple objectives: to integrate traditional Turkish music into the modern concert repertoire, to train Turkish instrumentalists and singers in this new fusion, to instruct Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques, to conceptualize the effects of music on performers and listeners, to establish a novel ensemble interface with specially designed instruments, to conduct in-depth studies on timbre, and to create a comprehensive framework for harmonizing Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nThe project's activities will span across Istanbul, Holland, and the UK and will include research workshops, performance training for both traditional and Western musicians, the development of an ensemble interface, timbre studies, and the meticulous mapping of Eastern and Western tuning systems. These activities will culminate in a range of valuable outputs: the publication of an E-book titled \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music\" by Cambridge University Press (CUP), the creation of an orchestration manual specifically for Turkish sounds, and the provision of online audio and visual examples to facilitate broader dissemination and education.\n\nThis proposal outlines a model for transcultural musical practice that not only bridges the gap between East and West but also has the potential to set a precedent for international musical collaboration and innovation. The project promises to make a significant contribution to the field of ethnomusicology and to the broader cultural landscape by documenting and developing approaches for a genuinely global musical dialogue."
