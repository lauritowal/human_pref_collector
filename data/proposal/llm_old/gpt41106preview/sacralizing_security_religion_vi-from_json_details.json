        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal \"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" aims to explore the complex dynamics between religion, violence, and authority within the sprawling urban landscapes of the Global South. In these mega-cities, state agencies often struggle to provide adequate infrastructure and security, leading to the emergence of religious vigilantes. These non-state security actors, who are affiliated with various religious organizations, systematically use violence to maintain order, operating alongside state actors.\n\nThe project seeks to answer critical research questions, including why residents of mega-cities grant authority to religious vigilantes and what role religion plays in legitimizing the practices of these vigilantes. An ethnographic comparison methodology will be implemented across three case studies: Rio de Janeiro (Christian and Afro-Brazilian religions), Lagos (Christian, Islamic, and Indigenous religions), and Jakarta (Islamic and Indigenous religions).\n\nThe aims of SACRASEC are threefold: to analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes, to draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, and to enable an in-depth analysis of how particular religious traditions engage with vigilantism in each context.\n\nThis research will extend the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, providing critical knowledge on the power structures within mega-cities of the Global South. Additionally, the findings will contribute to the development of policies aimed at improving human security by addressing the gaps in governance and the complex interplay between formal institutions and religious actors."
