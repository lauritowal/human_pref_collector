        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History\" (NUCLEARWATERS), aims to innovate the historiography of nuclear energy by asserting that it is, fundamentally, a history of water. This new approach seeks to unravel the intricate connections between water management and nuclear technology, presenting nuclear energy as an extension of centuries-old hydraulic civilizations and engineering practices. By framing nuclear energy as a hydraulic technology, NUCLEARWATERS proposes a novel argument that not only reframes our understanding of nuclear history but also has the potential to resolve key riddles that have long perplexed scholars in this field.\n\nThe project will explore historical water-manipulating technologies and the contrasting conceptions of wet and dry risks associated with nuclear energy. It will consist of six work packages, each delving into different themes such as the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the role of nuclear waters in the Soviet Union, the transformation of the Rhine Valley into a nuclearized river basin, the atomic coastscapes of Japan, and the nuclear narratives within the Baltic Sea region. Through these diverse case studies, NUCLEARWATERS will traverse geographical boundaries and historical epochs to offer a comprehensive water-centred history of nuclear energy.\n\nThe hypothesis that a water-centred perspective can resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history will be rigorously tested throughout the research. The ambition of NUCLEARWATERS is not only to revise the history of nuclear energy but also to influence the broader fields of the history of technology and environmental history. Beyond the academic sphere, the project seeks to impact public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond, encouraging a re-evaluation of the role of water in our energy choices and the environmental implications therein. In doing so, NUCLEARWATERS aspires to foster a more nuanced understanding of our hydraulic past and nuclear future."
