        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation\" (PRINCIPLES) addresses critical challenges of our time: global warming and pandemics such as Covid-19. Recognizing the necessity for populations to act in their collective interest, this innovative project aims to overcome the limitations of current models that often focus narrowly on single aspects of cooperation. PRINCIPLES seeks to forge a unified science of human cooperation, anchored in the key concept of rule-following.\n\nBy integrating knowledge from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology, the research will develop a comprehensive model of the behavioural principles underpinning large-scale cooperation. The project will experimentally test these principles, investigate the behavioural links between them, analyse models of social dilemmas, and ultimately explain behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems. This will be achieved through a novel framework that combines insights and methods from diverse social sciences, alongside incentivised experiments with representative samples.\n\nThe objectives are ambitious: to establish a sophisticated understanding of how individuals and groups navigate the complex landscape of shared problems like climate care. The insights gleaned from PRINCIPLES will be instrumental for researchers and policy makers across disciplines, equipping them with the necessary behavioural principles, tools, and data to address cooperation-related challenges effectively.\n\nThe target audience for this project includes both the academic community and policy makers who are at the forefront of strategizing responses to global issues. By focusing on climate care as a primary problem, PRINCIPLES demonstrates a commitment to addressing urgent environmental concerns through improved cooperation models. The outcomes of this research promise to make significant contributions to the study and practice of cooperation, with the potential to influence policies and interventions that facilitate better collective outcomes in the face of global threats."
