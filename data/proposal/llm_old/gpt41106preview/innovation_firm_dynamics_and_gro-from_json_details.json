        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: what do we learn from French firm-level data?\" aims to elucidate the interplay between innovation, economic growth, and firm dynamics within the French economy, guided by the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth. The project will explore several critical factors contributing to growth, including the roles of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and the influence of economic policies and institutions, particularly in the context of creative destructionâ€”a key concept in the Schumpeterian framework. \n\nFour core research questions will be addressed: (a) measuring productivity growth with a focus on total factor productivity (TFP) growth factors that account for new innovation; (b) investigating the causal relationships between innovation and international trade, specifically how exporting and importing activities may stimulate innovation; (c) examining the effects of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, with an emphasis on how French legislation changes have influenced self-employment incentives; and (d) exploring the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing, particularly the impact of creative destruction on social mobility and health.\n\nThe project will also consider broader economic phenomena, such as the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, and top income inequality, and how these are influenced by firm dynamics. The ultimate goal of the research is to inform growth policy design that fosters innovation and social mobility. By confronting economic theory with firm-level data, the project promises to deepen our understanding of the complex mechanisms governing innovation and growth and their implications for policy-making. This research is poised to make significant contributions to the literature and provide actionable insights for economic policymakers."
