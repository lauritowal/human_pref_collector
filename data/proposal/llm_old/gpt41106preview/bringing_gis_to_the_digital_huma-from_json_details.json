        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\n\nThe intersection of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and the Digital Humanities presents a transformative opportunity for scholarship. Our project, spearheaded by experienced professionals in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), aims to pioneer methodologies for the integration of GIS with unstructured textual analysis, addressing the research question: How can textual sources within a GIS broaden our understanding of the humanities?\n\nWe propose the development of innovative methods combining GIS with Corpus Linguistics to analyze literary and historical texts, thus defining the emerging field of Spatial Humanities. This endeavor will not only enhance our understanding of texts through spatial analysis but also contribute to the disciplines of HGIS, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History. Our focus will be on two in-depth studies: (1) an exploration of the English Lake District across three pivotal time periodsâ€”before, during, and after the Romantic era, and (2) an examination of mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales, considering socio-economic changes and political interventions.\n\nThe project's applications are vast, ranging from the interpretation of ancient manuscripts and modern newspapers to electronic resources, ensuring a major impact within the humanities and beyond. To maximize this impact, we will disseminate our findings through various outreach activities, including short courses, expert meetings, and conferences.\n\nOur work promises to set a precedent for future research at the nexus of textual sources and spatial analysis, leading to a more nuanced understanding of historical and cultural phenomena. Ultimately, through the fusion of GIS and textual analysis, the Spatial Humanities will foster a deeper comprehension of the complexities of human societies, past and present."
