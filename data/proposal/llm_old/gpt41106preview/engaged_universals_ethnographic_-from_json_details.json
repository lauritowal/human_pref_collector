        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the public good in Africa,\" aims to carry out a comprehensive anthropological study of how Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as defined within the Sustainable Development Goals, is understood and acted upon in distinct African contexts. The research will delve into the historical and current challenges—stemming from structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, privatization, and the disproportionate financial burden on the poor—that have fostered a general mistrust among citizens towards national healthcare systems. By examining UHC as a state responsibility and a public good, the project seeks to illuminate the complexities and conflicts inherent in its partial pursuit by African states.\n\nThe focus of the research is to analyze the intricate dynamics among actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, as well as the relationship between states and citizens. It will also investigate both formal systems and informal networks of social protection supporting health, considering the influence of national histories and social practices. Through a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, the project will provide nuanced insights into how UHC is variously interpreted and implemented across three African countries, and how these interpretations and enactments impact state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include charting new research directions and expanding knowledge with implications extending beyond African borders. The findings are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of the contested field of UHC and offer significant insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and international organizations striving to realize health as a public good. This research has the potential to inform strategies that align with the lived realities of African populations, fostering policies that are both effective and equitable."
