        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire,\" seeks funding to support a groundbreaking historical study that will redefine our understanding of European political economy during the eighteenth century. The proposed project will reassess the period by examining the practical concerns of the time, with a focus on the strategies and policies implemented for societal betterment and improvement. This approach diverts from the conventional method of retroactively applying modern economic theories to historical narratives.\n\nAt the heart of the investigation is the primary case study of the Swedish Empire, whose political economy will be scrutinized to uncover the intricacies of its growth, wealth distribution, and welfare policies. This case will not only provide valuable insights into the Swedish context but also serve as a benchmark for comparison with other cases across Europe to ensure broad applicability and a comprehensive understanding of the period's economic thought.\n\nThe project will delve into key concepts such as \"improvement,\" \"wealth,\" \"growth,\" and \"welfare,\" exploring how these ideas were understood and pursued during the eighteenth century. To achieve this, the research will analyze discursive production sites including the University, the Diet (the legislative body), local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The hypothesis driving this study is that activities within each site were primarily directed toward the dual objectives of refining the organization of the state and society and enhancing the living conditions of the populace.\n\nThrough this historical inquiry, the project aims to contribute to the academic discourse by offering a nuanced perspective that challenges the dominant narratives of early political economy. By shedding light on the practical applications of political and economic thought during this formative period, the project aspires to inform contemporary discussions on economic policies and societal welfare.\n\n(Keywords: Political Economy, Eighteenth Century, Swedish Empire, Improvement, Welfare, Historical Study)"
