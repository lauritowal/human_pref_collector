        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\" aims to embark on an ambitious scholarly endeavor that will comprehensively document, study, and conceptualize the phenomenon of multimedia, interactive recreations of Jerusalem through monumental sites across Europe. With an anticipated engagement with hundreds of such sites, the project will lay the groundwork for an extensive initial documentation and survey, setting the stage for long-term research outcomes that include new insights, comparative studies, and the conceptualization of these recreations as a cultural and religious network.\n\nOur study will be rooted in a multidisciplinary approach, examining these monuments as icons, maps, and networks through the lens of interactive multimedia, and the conceptions of space and place. This will allow us to delve into various contribution areas such as pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices, thereby enriching the understanding of the intersection between physical geography and spiritual landscapes.\n\nResearch activities will be comprehensive and include field documentation of sites, textual documentation from historical and contemporary sources, cross-referencing of data, grouping of monuments based on thematic and spatial criteria, and the crystallization of clusters within this monumental network. Collaborative methods will be integral to the project, with planned discussions, working papers, and the organization of symposia and conferences to foster scholarly exchange and dissemination of findings.\n\nThe project will ensure a steady stream of various outputs throughout its stages, enhancing the visibility and impact of the research. At the culmination of the project, a comprehensive book will be published, offering academic and public audiences alike a deep and structured insight into the complex web of Jerusalem's monumental projections in Europe, providing a new framework for understanding these sites as part of a larger cultural narrative."
