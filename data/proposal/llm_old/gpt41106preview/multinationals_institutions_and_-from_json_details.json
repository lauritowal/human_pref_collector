        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe,\" seeks to explore the nuanced relationship between multinational enterprises (MNEs), institutional frameworks, and innovation within the European context. With MNEs contributing an estimated US$16 trillion to global value-added—a staggering sum that represents more than a quarter of the world's GDP—their influence on economic landscapes is undeniable. This project will conduct a thorough investigation into how these powerful entities decide on locations and how such decisions impact the territories they inhabit.\n\nDespite the significant role MNEs play in the global economy, there remain substantial gaps in the literature, particularly concerning their location strategies and the subsequent territorial impacts. This research aims to bridge these gaps by meticulously analyzing the patterns and effects of MNEs' presence across Europe. The project is timely and critical, considering the dramatic increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows from developing economies, which surged from 16% of global outflows in 2007 to 31% in 2012, amounting to $426 billion.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach will provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between MNEs and the European innovation landscape. The outcomes of this research are expected to offer not only a deeper understanding of these dynamics but also practical tools for policymakers to navigate and harness the potentials of MNEs for local and regional development. By addressing these key issues, the project will contribute significantly to the academic discourse and provide a robust foundation for informed policy-making that can stimulate sustainable economic growth and innovation in Europe."
