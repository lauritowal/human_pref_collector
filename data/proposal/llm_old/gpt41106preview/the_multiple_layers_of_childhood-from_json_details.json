        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"The multiple LAYERS of childhood adversity,\" a groundbreaking research initiative designed to revolutionize our understanding of how childhood adversities affect health inequalities across generations. With a commitment to examining the lifelong and transgenerational effects of adversity, this project aims to construct a comprehensive data infrastructure encompassing life course analyses of over two million individuals across three generations.\n\nChildhood adversity is understood to establish patterns of health inequality that persist and evolve over time. This project's novelty lies in its focus on the multiple and intersecting layers of adversity, including biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental factors. Prior literature has predominantly concentrated on social adversity, but this proposal advocates for a holistic approach that recognizes the complexity of adversities faced during childhood.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, the project will employ a suite of interdisciplinary methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science, all grounded within a complex systems framework. This will enable a deeper understanding of the patterns and mechanisms by which adversity impacts life trajectories, as well as the dynamic nature of these effects as they unfold across time and generations.\n\nFurthermore, the initiative will incorporate a real-world policy data lab, which integrates nationwide policies and uses simulations to assess the impact of policy interventions. This will ensure that the research not only advances academic understanding but also has practical implications for redirecting policy focus toward multiple layers of adversity and identifying targeted support strategies for children and families.\n\nOverall, the proposed research holds the potential to significantly shift the current research paradigm, offering invaluable insights into the intricate fabric of childhood adversity and its far-reaching implications for individuals, families, and society."
