        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World,\" offers an innovative and transnational examination of the movements and experiences of Eastern Christians from the sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth century. This pivotal era witnessed the diaspora of Christians originating from the Ottoman Empire to diverse regions such as Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. The research aims to construct a global and connected history of Eastern Christianity during this period, thereby bridging the gap between micro-scale experiences of everyday life and macro-narratives in global history.\n\nUnder the supervision of the Principal Investigator, a team of multi-disciplinary researchers will utilize a methodological core of philology and source criticism to analyze a wealth of source materials in ten languages from three continents, sourced from dozens of archives. This vast collection of data will enable the team to reconstruct the interconnected narratives of Eastern Christians across the early modern world, highlighting the significance of their contributions to the cultural and religious tapestry of the era.\n\nThe project will employ a robust dissemination strategy, ensuring that the findings not only contribute to the academic fields of Middle Eastern history, European history, and global history but also reach a broader audience. Anticipated outcomes include a series of print publications, a searchable database to facilitate further research, and workshops designed to promote scholarly discourse and collaboration. These activities aim to foster a greater understanding of the conceptual challenge faced by historians in linking individual stories to broader historical phenomena.\n\nSpanning the time period from 1500 to 1750, \"Stories of Survival\" promises to shed new light on the subjects of Eastern Christians and their global diaspora, offering a fresh perspective on a vital but underexplored aspect of world history. The project stands to significantly impact the way early modern transnational movements are perceived and studied, making a valuable addition to historical knowledge and interpretation."
