The underlying framework is the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, where: (i) growth is generated by innovative entrepreneurs; (ii) entrepreneurial investments respond to incentives that are themselves shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations involves creative destruction. This project will explore new extensions of the Schumpeterian growth paradigm together with new firm-level and individual datasets to analyze the following questions : (a) the measurement of productivity growth and the extent to which measured TFP growth factors is correctly accounting for new innovation; (b) the relashionship between innovation and trade and more specifically the causal links from export and import to innovation, and the main channels through wich export and import affect innovation; (c) the effect of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship: in particular, how recent changes in the French legislation on self-employement have affected individual incentives to become self-employed, and differently so for different social or regional groups of individuals; (d) the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing: in particular, how does creative destruction (mesured by job or firm turnover) impact on social mobility (e.g measured by the probability of making it to top income brackets conditional upon a low initial income or a low parental income) and health. This approach can shed new light on important aspects of the growth process such as: the middle income trap, secular stagnation, the recent rise in top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Moreover, the paradigm can be used to think (or rethink) about growth policy design."
