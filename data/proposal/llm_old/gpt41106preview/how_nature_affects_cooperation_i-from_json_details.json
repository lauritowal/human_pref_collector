        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"How nature affects cooperation in common pool resource systems,\" aims to explore the multifaceted relationship between the natural environment and human economic behaviors, particularly in the context of managing common-pool resources (CPRs). The project is poised to establish a comprehensive understanding of how natural factors shape the preferences and incentives of economic agents and the consequential impact on CPR management. The project is notable for its ambitious continental coverage, including empirical studies across three different continents, and utilizes both theoretical and statistical approaches, ensuring a diverse and robust body of evidence.\n\nAt the heart of this research are three proposed mechanisms. Mechanism A investigates how the existence of tipping points and ecological thresholds within natural systems can act as catalysts for cooperation among resource users. Mechanism B examines the role of resource abundance volatility in shaping the risk preferences of individuals, influencing their decision-making and strategies for community-based management. Lastly, Mechanism C delves into how leadership and social structures interact with natural environments to enable collective action and resolve common-pool resource dilemmas.\n\nBy integrating insights from the fields of economics and sustainability science, this project aims to identify specific natural preconditions and social settings that favor the sustainable use of renewable resources. The goal is to elucidate circumstances that naturally engender cooperative behavior, thereby informing policy and providing a framework to encourage and facilitate the sustainable management of CPRs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly contribute to the global dialogue on sustainability and offer practical solutions for the preservation of shared environmental assets."
