        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Real Estate/Financial Complex\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Real Estate/Financial Complex,\" aims to investigate the intricate and often overlooked relationships between the real estate sector, financial markets, and state involvement. Despite the significant impact of these connections on the global economy, as evidenced by the 2007 financial crisis, there exists a substantial research gap in fully understanding these dynamics. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by introducing the metaphor of the \"real estate/financial complex\" to encapsulate the interactions across different scales and domains.\n\nCommencing in 2007, the project will employ a multi-faceted research approach. A postdoctoral researcher will conduct internationally comparative research to identify quantitative and qualitative shifts within the complex. The research team will include three PhD students, each tasked with creating national mappings of the complex in two countries and conducting in-depth local/urban case studies. This will ensure a comprehensive view that captures variances across different national and local contexts.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) will guide the exploration of the qualitative shift towards the nexus of real estate, finance, and the state's role, emphasizing the global dimensions of the complex. Additionally, the PI will oversee the conceptualization of the metaphor, which is poised to become a central framework for understanding these interactions.\n\nThis project promises to shed light on the critical yet underexplored connections between real estate and finance, emphasizing the varying scales of interaction and the pivotal role of state involvement. Our research is poised to offer groundbreaking insights, informing policymakers, scholars, and industry professionals of the complexities within the real estate/financial landscape that have significant implications for economic stability and development.\n\nKeywords: real estate, finance, state involvement, research gap, internationally comparative research, case studies."
