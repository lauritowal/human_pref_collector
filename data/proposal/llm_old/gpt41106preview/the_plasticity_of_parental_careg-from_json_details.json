        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal requests funding for a pioneering study titled \"The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting.\" The project aims to unravel the complex neural underpinnings of parenting, a central aspect of human behavior, by examining the cerebral transformations accompanying the transition to parenthood and the effect of potential disruptions on this process.\n\nThe first subproject focuses on the normal development of parental caregiving. Through a longitudinal study design, this subproject will investigate structural and functional brain changes in new parents, both women and men, beginning before pregnancy and extending into the postpartum period. By employing neuroimaging techniques alongside behavioural measures on caregiving tasks, this research seeks to delineate the typical trajectory of brain adaptations associated with the evolution of caregiving behaviors.\n\nIn contrast, the second subproject will adopt a cross-sectional approach to explore disrupted development of parental caregiving due to specific adversities, such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality, namely cleft lip and palate. This subproject will examine the brain and behavioural effects of these disruptions on caregiving, providing insight into how such challenges may alter the developmental course of parenting-related brain circuitry.\n\nLastly, subproject three aims to synthesize findings from the first two subprojects using advanced computational models. This integrative effort seeks to identify fundamental brain mechanisms and networks that are instrumental in the development of parenting. By establishing such a mechanistic framework, the project will contribute to the broader understanding of the neurobiological substrates that facilitate adaptive parental behaviors and the vulnerabilities that might lead to caregiving deficits.\n\nUltimately, the proposed research strives to generate a comprehensive map of the brain-based architecture of parenting, offering a foundation for interventions to support parents facing challenges and to promote healthy child development."
