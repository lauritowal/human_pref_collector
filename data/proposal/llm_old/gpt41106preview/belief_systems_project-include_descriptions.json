        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the study of belief systems, a pivotal element in the comprehension of democratic politics, extremism, and political decision-making. The current conceptualization of belief systems as latent variables influencing attitudes and values is limited, as it fails to capture the intricate network of interconnections that constitute the belief system. The proposed Belief Systems Project aims to redefine belief systems as networks of interrelated attitudes and values, employing network analyses to investigate the interactive nodes within this network.\n\nThe project is poised to propel belief systems research beyond its current scope by achieving four key objectives: (1) It will map the structural configuration of attitude and value systems, which is unattainable with existing methodologies. (2) It will address long-standing inquiries regarding the core concepts and the cohesion within belief systems. (3) By modeling individual belief systems and their fluctuations, the project will improve predictions regarding partisan motivated reasoning. (4) Additionally, it will scrutinize the influence of both external factors, such as perceived threats, and internal dynamics on the evolution of belief systems.\n\nThe research will employ a multifaceted approach, incorporating international survey data, longitudinal panel studies, intensive longitudinal designs, controlled experiments, and textual analysis to triangulate the architecture of political belief systems across time, cultures, and individuals. The outcomes of this project stand to significantly enrich our understanding of how belief systems are structured and evolve, offering profound implications for the study of political behavior and societal dynamics."

What is the basic structure of belief systems? Clear answers to this fundamental question are not forthcoming. This is due to flaws in the conceptualization of belief systems. The state-of-the-art treats a belief system as a theoretical latent variable that causes people’s responses on attitudes and values relevant to the belief system. This approach cannot assess a belief system because it cannot assess the network of connections between the beliefs–attitudes and values–that make up the system; it collapses across them and the interrelationships are lost. The Belief Systems Project conceptualizations belief systems as systems of interconnecting attitudes and values. I conceptualize attitudes and values as interactive nodes in a network that are analysed with network analyses. With these conceptual and empirical tools, I can understand the structure and dynamics of the belief system and will be able to avoid theoretical pitfalls common in belief system assessments. This project will move belief systems research beyond the state-of-the-art in four ways by: 1. Mapping the structure of systems of attitudes and values, something that is not possible using current methods. 2. Answering classic questions about central concepts and clustering of belief systems. 3. Modeling within-person belief systems and their variations, so that I can make accurate predictions about partisan motivated reasoning. 4. Testing how external and internal pressures (e.g., feelings of threat) change the underlying structure and dynamics of belief systems. Using survey data from around the world, longitudinal panel studies, intensive longitudinal designs, experiments, and text analyses, I will triangulate on the structure of political belief systems over time, between countries, and within individuals.",
