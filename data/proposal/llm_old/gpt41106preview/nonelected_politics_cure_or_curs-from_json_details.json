        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Non-elected politics: Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\" seeks to explore the increasingly pertinent issue of citizens' growing disengagement from politics, as evidenced by historically low electoral turnout and the rise of anti-establishment and populist parties. This disengagement has led to a marked decline in trust in representative institutions and has prompted calls for institutional reforms to revitalize democracy within Europe. The central paradox that this research aims to address is the contradiction inherent in the idea of delegating decision-making powers, which are traditionally held by elected officials, to non-elected entities such as selected citizens and experts. This approach challenges the very tenet of elected control that is at the heart of representative democracy.\n\nThe project's central hypothesis posits that non-elected politics does not have a universal effect on support for representative democracy. To test this hypothesis, the research will employ a variety of methods, including online survey experiments and panel surveys, to gather detailed data on European preferences for democratic function and reforms. Furthermore, the study will compile a comprehensive inventory of cases where citizens and experts have been empowered since the year 2000 and analyze the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy.\n\nThe societal implications of this research are far-reaching. By examining the effects of non-elected politics on the crisis of representative democracy, the project will not only contribute to a better understanding of current democratic challenges but also inform the debate on potential democratic innovations. Ultimately, the findings could offer valuable insights for policymakers and other stakeholders seeking to strengthen democratic engagement and trust in political systems in Europe."
