        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine,\" seeks funding to explore and validate a set of ten provocative claims concerning the formation and maintenance of long-term memories in both human and artificial systems. The research is designed to be highly interdisciplinary, bridging psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development.\n\nThe primary aims of the project are to investigate whether humans can recognize stimuli not encountered for decades, understand the role of attention-related brain activity in memory storage, and examine the concept of 'Grandmother Cells' and 'Neocortical Dark Matter' in long-term memory retention. The inquiry extends to the possibility of replicating such phenomena in artificial systems, specifically through the use of spiking neural network models and the development of memristor-like devices.\n\nOur approach will deploy an array of experimental paradigms to study the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories. This includes state-of-the-art imaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and intracerebral recordings from epileptic patients, as well as computer simulations featuring networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) to model memory selectivity. Furthermore, we aim to develop bio-inspired hardware that mimics the memory systems of the brain, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of neural processes and advancing the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe project promises to provide insights into the fundamental principles of memory in biological systems, with potential applications in improving memory-related disorders and advancing the development of sophisticated artificial intelligence systems with human-like memory capabilities. Through its innovative and collaborative framework, \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\" aims to shed light on the enigmatic nature of memory, bridging the gap between cognitive functions and artificial computation."
