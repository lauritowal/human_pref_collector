        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the elderly to places where care is more affordable\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative multi-sited anthropological study aimed at examining the transnationalization of elderly care within Europe. The research focuses on the phenomenon of ageing bodies being relocated to care locations that offer services at a fraction of the cost in their home countries, a trend encapsulated by terms such as \"grandmother deportation\" and \"geriatric colonialism.\" The study will explore the marketization of care and its welfare implications, particularly the entanglement of welfare states and entitlements across borders.\n\nThe proposed research will conduct in-depth ethnographic studies in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungaryâ€”countries that have become desirable destinations for target patients from Austria and Germany due to the significantly lower care costs. The research will delve into various aspects, including labour migration, real estate investment, and the involvement of state insurances and regional migration policies. It will also investigate the historical context of German and Habsburg-Hungarian history that underpins these contemporary movements.\n\nThe management of care homes in these locations, often by former migrant care workers and international companies, presents a unique dynamic where German-speaking patients interact with local wealthier elderly, raising questions about language and cultural integration in care settings. The study will investigate the implications of such arrangements for the individuals and societies involved.\n\nBy examining the responses to the privatization of care landscapes, the research seeks to understand what it means to grow old and require care in an intertwined Europe. It will provide insights into how care relocation is becoming part of future making, with significant implications for policy-making and the conceptualization of welfare in an increasingly mobile and market-driven context."
