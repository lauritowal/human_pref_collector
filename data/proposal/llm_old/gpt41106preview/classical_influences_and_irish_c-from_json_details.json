        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture,\" aims to investigate the unique and underexplored history of Ireland's cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome, despite Ireland not being part of the Roman Empire. The hypothesis posits that Ireland's tradition of classical learning, evident in its earliest recorded literature, has played a vital role in shaping its identity. This project seeks to understand why Ireland's classical reception is distinctive by examining nine thematic areas: language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence.\n\nEmploying a multi-thematic and heuristic framework, the research will foster a dialogue between various fields, including classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English and Irish language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a comprehensive view of the classical influence on Ireland's literary, social, and political discourses.\n\nThe research is timely, as it coincides with the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state (1912-1922), offering a unique opportunity to reflect on the contemporary preoccupations with the politics and history of Ireland, including the violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. The expected impact of this project is to open new avenues of investigation into the classical culture's influence on Ireland that extends beyond the past 100 years. By doing so, the project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the historical and ongoing dialogue between Ireland and the classical world."
