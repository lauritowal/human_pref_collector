        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\n\nThe \"Post Scriptum\" project aims to create a digital archive of personal letters from a diverse array of authors, including servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters from 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain. These documents provide a unique window into the lives of ordinary individuals and their interpersonal relationships within traditional communities. The letters, which were often scrutinized by institutions like the Inquisition and civil courts, reveal a rich tapestry of oral rhetoric, emotional expression, commonsense reasoning, and narration of everyday incidents, as well as confessions of non-orthodox beliefs.\n\nOur project will involve a systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic study of these documents, supplemented by sociological interviews to enhance our understanding of the context in which these writings were produced. The focus of the study is a well-contextualized examination of inter-personal modes of relation during this pivotal historical period.\n\nThe anticipated project output includes the assembly of a large collection of personal letters, the creation of an online digital edition with philological treatment, and a comprehensive cultural and linguistic study. The project will adhere to the highest standards of Textual Criticism in its editing process. This digital archive will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers, historians, linguists, and the general public, preserving the voices of individuals who have long been absent from historical narratives."
