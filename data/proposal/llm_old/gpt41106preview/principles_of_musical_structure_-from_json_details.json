        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\" aims to significantly enhance our understanding of human cognition with a particular emphasis on how the brain processes complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures inherent in music perception. At the heart of this research is the ambition to transcend current theoretical frameworks by crafting a novel unified theory of musical syntax that pushes beyond the limitations of context-free grammars, which currently dominate the field.\n\nThe theoretical strand of the project will focus on the intricate details of harmonic structure and voice leading constraints, addressing the shortcomings of existing approaches that are largely confined to harmonic syntax. By aspiring to exceed the expressive power of tree-based grammars, the project endeavors to establish a more comprehensive theory that can accurately encapsulate the complexities of musical syntax.\n\nIn the computational realm, this project will undertake the ambitious task of compiling and publishing an extensive corpus of digitized syntactic analyses. At its core, this effort will involve the application of the unified syntax theory utilizing advanced techniques such as generalized parsing and graph grammars. The resultant analytical corpus will serve as both a training and an evaluation resource for computational models, offering a robust platform for empirical validation.\n\nThe experimental component of the project seeks to empirically test specific predictions regarding mental representations of musical structure. Investigating aspects such as nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision processes, and tension will provide vital insights into cognitive processes involved in music perception.\n\nBy bridging the gaps between music cognition and cognitive sciences, this project holds the promise of significant contributions to both fields. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will not only shed light on the complex dynamics of musical structure building but also offer a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon."
