        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development,\" addresses the critical issue of access to public servicesâ€”a problem that, as reported by the Lancet Health Commission in 2018, results in an estimated 5.7 million annual deaths and affects over 100 million people living in poverty due to inadequate service access. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in adopting digital technologies to enhance service delivery, low-income countries face significant challenges, including a high rate of abandoned digitalization projects, as highlighted by the World Development Report in 2016.\n\nThis project aims to analyze the determinants of success or failure in digitalizing public service delivery, with the goal of improving efficiency and inclusion. There are inherent risks in digitization efforts, such as the potential exclusion of individuals with limited connectivity. To mitigate these risks, the research will focus on understanding both the demand side (public services accessed digitally) and the supply side (in-person services coupled with remote monitoring).\n\nCollaborating with local governments and NGOs, the project will conduct four experiments across India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to gather data and insights. The study will provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of digitalization strategies in varied contexts and identify the critical factors that lead to successful implementation and scaling.\n\nThe outcome of the project is to ensure that a broader segment of the population, particularly in low-income countries, gains access to more and higher quality public services. The findings will have significant policy implications, informing public policy and strategies aimed at achieving inclusive development through digitalization. This research seeks to bridge the digital divide and ensure that the benefits of digital public services are universally accessible, thus contributing to the global goal of poverty reduction and improved health outcomes."
