        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal titled \"Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45\" seeks to conduct an in-depth historical analysis of Japanese military justice and its consequential role in the regulation and escalation of violence during the Asia-Pacific War. Spanning from 1937 to 1945 across East Asia and Southeast Asia, this project aims to dissect the complex interactions between Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy combatants within the framework of military legal practices.\n\nThe project's primary purposes are to explore how violence was regulated to achieve war goals, the methods used to deter and coerce civilian populations, and the implications for the legitimacy and legality of Japan's war efforts. To this end, the outcome of these legal practices, notably execution and harsh imprisonment, will be scrutinized to understand their impact on military and civilian life during the war.\n\nThe research will place particular focus on two central aspects: the functioning of military justice and the broader narrative of violence during the Asia-Pacific War. The approach will involve a meticulous analysis of legal practice, examining the routinization and escalation of violence as mechanisms employed within the military courts. This will be achieved through original archival work, tapping into primary sources that have yet to be fully explored in scholarship.\n\nThis project intersects with the fields of Modern Japanese history and International law, promising to contribute significant insights and deepen academic understanding in these areas. Furthermore, the findings are expected to resonate beyond the historical context, offering relevant implications for contemporary humanitarian issues and the ongoing discourse on the laws of war and military justice.\n\nBy shedding light on the historical dimensions of military legal systems in wartime Japan, this research seeks to provide a nuanced perspective that informs both historical scholarship and contemporary legal and ethical debates."
