        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the research project entitled \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises.\" The central objective of this project is to unravel the complex mechanisms underpinning strong credit growth and its role in precipitating banking crises. Despite a broad consensus on the need to tighten financial regulation, especially with a macroprudential dimension, there is still a significant gap in understanding the specific factors that contribute to these economic phenomena and the negative externalities they impose on the macro real sector.\n\nThe project aims to identify and estimate the impact of various factors, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending and real estate price booms, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios, on loan growth. The research will address the challenge posed by the global banking system's complexity and the scarcity of detailed micro-level data by employing an empirical approach to determine the individual and combined effects of these ingredients on credit expansion.\n\nWith an appropriate methodology leveraging exceptional micro-level datasets, the project will fill the current void of decisive empirical evidence on the subject. The theoretical framework will be supplemented as necessary, and the interaction of different factors will be assessed to understand potential combinations that may amplify risks. The focus on credit growth is essential to provide insights into the mechanisms that lead to financial instability.\n\nThe project's external validity will be ensured through the careful selection of individual dataset settings and methodologies, allowing for a broad generalization of findings across different contexts. In conclusion, this research will provide policymakers and financial regulators with critical insights into the drivers of loan growth and financial crises, thereby offering a solid empirical basis for the development of more effective macroprudential policies and regulations."
