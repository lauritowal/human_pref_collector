        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"What are the origins of empathy? A comparative developmental investigation,\" represents the first comparative study examining the development of empathy in humans and bonobos. Empathy is a fundamental aspect of social behavior, but its origins and evolutionary trajectory remain unclear. This project aims to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in this capacity, and challenge existing perspectives on human emotional evolution.\n\nEmploying a cross-species approach, the research will focus on longitudinal observations and innovative experiments using advanced techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking. The project will observe human infants in distributed-caregiving societies in Vanuatu and Samoa, comparing these findings with those from both wild and semi-captive bonobo contexts. This comparative framework will explore the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, with divergences in human motivation to alleviate others' emotional states and a unique human capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include uncovering shared and unique aspects of empathy in humans and bonobos, potentially revealing human-specific tendencies for sharing and cooperation. The interdisciplinary integration of biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology will provide a comprehensive understanding of empathy's origins, with significant implications for our knowledge of social behaviors across species.\n\nThis investigation promises to advance our understanding of empathy, with potential applications in enhancing cooperative and empathetic behaviors in human societies. The proposed study aligns with the goals of understanding complex social behaviors from an evolutionary perspective, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on human nature and social cognition."
