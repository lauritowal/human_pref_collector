        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Role of Consciousness in Adaptive Behavior: A Combined Empirical, Computational, and Robot-Based Approach\n\nThe Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project proposes a transformative exploration of the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior. Our central hypothesis is that in an increasingly intentional agent-dominated world, control architectures must evolve to ensure coherent and effective actions. This innovative research aims to resolve the paradox between consciousness and action, elucidate neuronal principles underpinning conscious processes, and construct a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture.\n\nEmploying a multidisciplinary approach that integrates empirical research, computational modeling, and robot-based validation, CDAC will investigate parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation, with a secondary level of control dedicated to establishing a coherent conscious scene. Within this conscious scene, functions such as credit assignment and planning beyond immediate perception will be scrutinized.\n\nThe outcomes of the project are poised to deliver a framework that advances beyond the current state of the art, offering system-level models of conscious architecture. Computational studies will probe the underpinnings of the neuronal substrate, while empirical validation will be achieved through implementations in humanoid robots and therapeutic interventions with stroke patients. These validations will not only reinforce the theoretical foundations of the research but also lead to the development of pioneering tools for neurorehabilitation.\n\nCDAC's relevance extends across multiple domains, promising to address profound questions regarding the function and genesis of consciousness, augment our understanding of the mind and brain, and contribute to a new generation of robots equipped with advanced social competencies. This ambitious project stands at the intersection of neuroscience, robotics, and cognitive science, and is poised to redefine our understanding of consciousness in adaptive behavior within a multidisciplinary context."
