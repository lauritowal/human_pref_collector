        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\nThis grant proposal sets out to explore the intricate domain of functional cerebral asymmetry, marking the 150th anniversary since Paul Broca's pioneering work on brain lateralization and language. The project aims to unravel the complex relationships between genetic factors, neuropsychological processes, and their impact on language development and lateralization. Central to our investigation is the \"Network efficiency hypothesis,\" which postulates that the segregation of language functions across the cerebral hemispheres may lead to increased risks for language and literacy impairments.\n\nThe research framework is comprised of five distinct yet interconnected projects, each employing a multifaceted approach to dissect the etiology and correlates of cerebral asymmetry. Project A will employ behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralisation. Project B predicts an increased risk for language and literacy impairment if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres. \n\nProject C will utilize simulations from genetic models alongside twin-cotwin similarity data to assess language lateralisation. Project D introduces a \"Double hit genetic model,\" predicting that neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise with more than one hit on a functional brain circuit, focusing on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome. Lastly, Project E will explore rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements in individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality, examining the associated factors that contribute to a departure from the consistent left hemisphere language dominance.\n\nThis multi-layered research endeavor seeks to provide groundbreaking insights into the biological underpinnings of cerebral asymmetry and its implications for language development and disorders. The outcomes of this research promise to have significant implications for educational strategies, clinical interventions, and our understanding of the genetic and neuropsychological foundations of language lateralization."
