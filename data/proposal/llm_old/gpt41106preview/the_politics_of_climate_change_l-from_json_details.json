        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\"**\n\nClimate change poses an existential threat to global communities, demanding an urgent international response to mitigate its detrimental consequences. The project entitled \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\" (CCLAD) seeks to advance our understanding of the complexities surrounding the emergence and contestation of justice norms within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This project falls under the research area of International Relations, with a specific focus on the interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic examination of how norms evolve and are challenged within the context of climate change policy-making.\n\nWith the UNFCCC as its backdrop, CCLAD addresses the critical issue of loss and damage associated with climate change impacts. The project's aim is to explore the urgent need to address the consequences of climate change, particularly in policy areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration. A significant obstacle identified is the lack of consensus on loss and damage policy, which this research will tackle head-on.\n\nCCLAD's objectives include understanding the conditions necessary for norm hegemony, examining the dynamics of influence, contestation, or reversal of norms, and providing new insights into the fluidity of norm content. To achieve these objectives, the project will utilize a combination of research methods, including the micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative research on domestic policy practices.\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of CCLAD is the notion that norms are partly constituted through the processes of policy-making and implementation. By contributing methodologically to the field of political ethnography and developing practice-tracing methods, CCLAD aspires to offer a nuanced study of norm emergence and contestation specifically tailored to the challenges posed by climate change loss and damage.\n\nOverall, this project promises to make a valuable contribution to the scholarly discourse on international norms and provide practical insights that could influence policy-making at both international and national scales of governance."
