        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThe proposed research project aims to unravel the complex interactions between personal experiences, the information environment, and economic shocks to understand their cumulative effects on political decisions, particularly the rise of populism and support for extremist agendas. This multifaceted empirical study is segmented into three core parts, each examining distinct but interrelated factors influencing political behavior and attitudes.\n\nPart 1 of the research will delve into the impact of personal employment histories combined with the local information environment on voting patterns, specifically the 2016 support for Donald Trump. Utilizing an extensive database of over 40 million resumes from 2010 to 2016, alongside zipcode-level economic and voting variables, the project will conduct a granular analysis of how micro-level labor market experiences and macro-level information shape electoral outcomes.\n\nPart 2 will explore the long-term influence of negative social experiences on individual labor market success and the propensity to support populist political agendas. By examining archival records of corporal punishment regulations in UK schools during the 1970s and 80s, and juxtaposing this with contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting patterns, we aim to establish causative links between early life experiences and later political preferences.\n\nThe final segment, Part 3, will investigate the factors that incite active resistance to extremist regimes. Leveraging a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on exposure to bombing and foreign propaganda in WWII Germany, the study seeks to understand the determinants of resistance movements and their effectiveness in countering extremism.\n\nOverall, this project not only seeks to provide a comprehensive empirical test of the determinants of political decisions but also aspires to offer insights into the mechanisms through which economic shocks and personal experiences shape the populist and extremist rhetoric, potentially informing policy interventions to mitigate such phenomena."
