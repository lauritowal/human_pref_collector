        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\" aims to revolutionize the application of social science in policy-making through a robust and innovative philosophical framework. Funded by the Horizon 2020 program, K4U confronts the critical challenge faced by contemporary social policies: the prevailing emphasis on knowledge production with insufficient focus on the practical use of this knowledge. The project's ambition is to construct a new approach that enhances the utility of social science in developing, implementing, and assessing social policies.\n\nAt the heart of K4U lies a philosophical study of social science technology, combined with a fresh reconceptualization of objectivity and deliberation in the policy-making context. It questions the traditional role of values at the science/society interface, advocating for a Popperian approach that emphasizes the practical application of philosophy. This approach is grounded in the belief that philosophical insights must not only be theoretically sound but also practically relevant to policy design and deliberation.\n\nThe objectives of K4U are multifaceted. The project seeks to develop a practical understanding that assists policy designers in weighing the effectiveness, evidence, likelihood of success, costs, benefits, stakeholders involved, and the acceptability of proposed policies. By achieving these goals, K4U aims to bridge the gap between the richness of social science knowledge and its real-world applications.\n\nK4U promises to make significant contributions to both policy-making and the academic community. It introduces 'philosophy for practice' as a guiding principle and pioneers the launch of the philosophy of social technology field. Ultimately, the project will equip policy-makers, scholars, and social science practitioners with intelligible and practical insights, enabling them to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies effectively, thus fostering more informed, equitable, and successful social policies."
