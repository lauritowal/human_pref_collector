        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance: organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI\" aims to explore the critical intersection of human decision-making and artificial intelligence (AI) within the domain of national health governance. This multi-sited ethnography will focus on the socio-cultural and organizational dimensions that influence whether and why data analysts and medical experts adhere to or diverge from AI-generated advice.\n\nCentral to our investigation are the concepts of algorithmic ethics and ethical AI, which are becoming increasingly relevant as big data and AI systems are integrated into health governance frameworks. Despite significant advancements in AI technologies, there remains a substantial gap in understanding the socio-cultural context of AI application in real-world settings, particularly regarding the empirical evidence of human intervention in AI processes. Our research aims to analyze moments of human intervention with AI, utilizing a comparative approach across six national settings.\n\nThe project's goals include developing a comprehensive theory on the organizational factors that contribute to the ethical deployment of AI, as well as applying future-scenarioing anthropological methods to project the implications of current practices. By connecting anthropological insights directly with AI development, the project will foster a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between technology and human agency.\n\nIn collaboration with health decision-makers and policy institutions, the expected impact of this research is twofold: it will influence national health policies by providing informed insights into the integration of AI, and it will have a tangible effect on individual human lives by ensuring that AI aids in making more ethical and contextually appropriate health decisions. The project will offer a pioneering empirical analysis of the circumstances under which professionals in the health sector engage with AI, ultimately contributing to the responsible evolution of AI in public health governance."
