        "Abstract:\n\nThe proliferation of disinformation online poses a significant threat to democratic processes and informed decision-making. The project \"FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results\" aims to tackle this challenge by understanding the extent to which an individual's browsing history affects the search engine results they receive, particularly in relation to disinformation. This research and development initiative will lead to the creation of a groundbreaking auditing system designed to empower democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens by providing them with the capability to identify emerging disinformation swiftly.\n\nThe core objective of FARE_AUDIT is to dissect and breach the information bubbles that are perpetuated by personalized search results. Through simulating various online user profiles, the project will offer insights into how different browsing behaviors influence the likelihood of being directed toward disinformation. The tool will be equipped with innovative features, including an auditing mechanism for search engines and privacy-preserving web crawlers, which operate without the need for real user data. This is particularly pertinent given the current technology shifts from traditional cookie-tracking to more invasive fingerprinting techniques.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of FARE_AUDIT include a notable increase in public awareness regarding the role search engines play in the dissemination of disinformation, as well as providing essential organizations with an efficient and robust tool for disinformation detection and ongoing monitoring. By addressing the critical gap in efforts to understand and mitigate the spread of disinformation via search engines, FARE_AUDIT stands to offer a significant contribution to the integrity of information dissemination in the digital age."
