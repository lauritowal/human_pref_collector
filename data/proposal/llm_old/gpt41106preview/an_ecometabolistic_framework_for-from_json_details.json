        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\" addresses the pressing global crisis of material depletion by advancing sustainable building practices through a bio-based material paradigm. It aims to confront the challenges inherent in the architectural transition to bio-based materials, including their representation, conceptualization, and operationalization within the field. This innovative research proposes an eco-metabolistic framework to reimagine the fundamental value proposition of architecture and the conception of material lifespan.\n\nInterdisciplinary by nature, the project will employ research-by-design methods to explore carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions. It will investigate the potential of bio-based materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria, utilizing computational modelling networks for predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. This will enable the creation of structures that embody a design agency concept of continual construction that extends beyond building completion.\n\nThe project's objectives are to facilitate architecture that can adapt and respond to environmental conditions and material life cycles through participatory practices. It aims to foster sustainable practice and socially conscious models of production that are democratic and inclusive. By challenging traditional design agency, the project proposes new practices that leverage the short lifespans of bio-based materials to achieve sustainability in architecture.\n\nThe expected outcomes include the development of a framework that not only promotes environmentally responsible design but also encourages community engagement in the production process, thereby contributing to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable built environment."
