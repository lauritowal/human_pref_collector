        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, titled \"Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization,\" aims to unlock the historical antecedents of modern state capacity and democratic processes by delving into the colonial conquest of Latin America. The primary focus is to explore the establishment of early institutions during the dawn of Spanish colonization, and how these institutions have influenced the trajectory of political development, state building, and the emergence of political dynasties in the region.\n\nEmploying an innovative methodological approach, the study will integrate case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables to dissect the complex interplay between these early institutions and the development of state capacity and democracy. A significant advantage of this research is the temporal scope, which is confined to the initial years of colonizationâ€”a period when conquerors were largely unfamiliar with the native lands and resources. This allows for a more precise analysis of the institutional groundwork laid by the colonizers without the confounding effects of later knowledge and exploitation.\n\nThe project will rely on primary historical documents, such as the Capitulaciones and records from the Archivo de Indias, to gather detailed information on the rules governing early institutions and the precise locations of initial settlements at a subnational level. This will provide a unique lens through which to examine the lasting impacts of these early decisions and their role in shaping contemporary political dynamics.\n\nBy shedding light on the colonial origins of state capacity and democratization, the research will not only contribute to our historical understanding but also provide valuable insights into the enduring consequences of colonial rule on present-day governance structures and political behavior. This project promises to be a significant step forward in the fields of political economy, historical institutionalism, and Latin American studies."
