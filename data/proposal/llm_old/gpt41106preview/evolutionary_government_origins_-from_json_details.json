        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal for \"Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government\" aims to explore the dynamic transformations within government institutions and their impact on policy-making processes. The research is driven by critical inquiries into why government structures evolve and how these changes influence the policies they enact. The proposed project, named STATE-DNA, will utilize the theoretical framework of evolutionary government to examine historical patterns and forecast future shifts in governmental organization.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that the evolution of government structures results from the interplay between the intrinsic characteristics of government units and the external organizational or environmental pressures they face. Furthermore, structural changes are posited to affect government policy as an inherent outcome of the evolutionary process, controlled by distinct organizational units. The STATE-DNA project will compile a comprehensive data set spanning from 1815 to 2025, encompassing over 150,000 governmental units from six countries, providing an unprecedented longitudinal perspective on structural change within governments.\n\nKey concepts investigated include the mechanisms of structural change, the fluctuating roles of units within ministries and agencies, and the implications of the decline in party government. Methodologically, the project will incorporate innovative genetic measures to assess structural changes and data assimilation techniques derived from biological sciences, applying them within a political framework.\n\nExpected outcomes include the creation of an extensive historical database of government structures, a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy, and the development of predictive models for forecasting future governmental evolution. By unraveling the complexities of structural transformation in governments, the STATE-DNA study will offer valuable insights into the organizational underpinnings of policy variation and adaptation in governance across different historical and cultural contexts."
