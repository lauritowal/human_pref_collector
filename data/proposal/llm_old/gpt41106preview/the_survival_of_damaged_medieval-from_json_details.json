        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"POLYCHROME: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\" aims to explore the resilience and transformation of Nordic polychromed wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces that have endured since the Reformation. This study will specifically focus on painted and gilded Christian images within the geographical scope of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, examining their shift from objects of devotion to cultural heritage. The research aims to address the significant gap in understanding the status, volatility, and historical repairs of these objects, countering the current assumptions that damage is primarily due to accidents or unspecific vandalism.\n\nThe hypothesis posits that the damage may be intricately linked to iconoclastic acts, particularly during the historical events of the break with the church in Rome, led by Gustav I in Sweden in 1527 and by Christian III in Denmark-Norway in 1537. Challenges such as the lack of archival evidence and the presence of secondary paints masking crucial information will be addressed through the application of cutting-edge technologies from the natural sciences.\n\nThe methodology will include the analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, extensive material data collection, mapping of restorations and repairs, and the establishment of foundations for future multidisciplinary studies. This will foster a nuanced debate about heritage values and inform future care and conservation approaches.\n\nExpected outcomes of the POLYCHROME project include a deeper understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism on these objects, the influencing of training priorities for conservationists, and insights into the broader societal and cultural implications of the treatment of heritage objects. This research will provide a comprehensive description of how these valuable artifacts have survived through turbulent historical periods and offer recommendations for their continued preservation."
