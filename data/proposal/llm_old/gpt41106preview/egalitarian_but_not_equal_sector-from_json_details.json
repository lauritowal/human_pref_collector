        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\" (WAGE), aims to deepen our understanding of the persistent gender pay gap (GPG) within the context of collective bargaining processes. Despite a global average GPG of 20% and a slightly lower European average of 13%, little is known about the gendered nature of wage-setting mechanisms at the sectoral level. This research seeks to theorize the intricate ways in which collective bargaining contributes to the wage disparities between male-dominated and female-dominated sectors.\n\nCentering on Germany, Norway, and Sweden, countries with robust collective bargaining systems, the WAGE project will focus on two contrasting sectors: the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. By conducting ethnographic research, the project will achieve three main objectives: (1) to compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in these countries; (2) to uncover and analyze the daily practices during bargaining rounds that result in differential wage outcomes; and (3) to document and explain the attitudes and actions of actors within these sectors in relation to established wage norms and sector-specific gendered wage differentials.\n\nWith data sourced from the United Nations (2022) and Eurostat (2022), the WAGE project will offer a novel, in-depth analysis of the socio-economic structures that perpetuate gender-based wage inequity. By identifying the covert mechanisms of wage formation, this research will not only advance academic understanding but also inform policy recommendations aimed at promoting wage equality. The findings are expected to be of significant value to stakeholders, including labor unions, policymakers, and gender equality advocates, in their efforts to dismantle systemic barriers to equal pay for equal work."
