        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Information services: competition and externalities\" aims to enhance our understanding of the economics of information services, focusing on the strategic interactions and externalities inherent in their production and exchange. This multidisciplinary proposal addresses the complexities of one-sided and two-sided network externalities, the nature of information as a public good, and the interplay between information services and physical infrastructures.\n\nStructured in four parts, the project begins with a theoretical examination of the background theory, including two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities. The second part delves into the virtual layer of information services, exploring recommendation systems, issues of privacy, and the transaction costs associated with e-commerce platforms. This will involve an empirical investigation using proprietary transactional data from e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe third part investigates the physical layer, considering pricing and investment strategies and their implications for net-neutrality and data pricing. The fourth and final part of the project looks at the implications for competition policy, especially in the context of two-sided markets.\n\nThe project's approach combines the development of relevant economic theory with empirical investigation and the creation of original dynamic investment models. These tools and insights are intended to inform and guide competition policy makers in navigating the complex landscape of information services.\n\nBy exploring the role of externalities in information services, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis that will facilitate the creation of more efficient and equitable information markets. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly impact both theoretical understanding and practical policy-making in the rapidly evolving digital economy."
