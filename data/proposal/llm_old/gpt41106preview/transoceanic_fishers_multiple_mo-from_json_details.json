        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple Mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the research project \"Transoceanic Fishers,\" which aims to explore the dynamic and multifaceted nature of fisher movements within and beyond the South China Sea, involving nations such as China, Vietnam, various African countries, and Oceania. The project challenges the prevailing assumption that views fishers solely as instruments of state agendas by investigating their roles as fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers within transoceanic networks.\n\nThe project will employ a novel theoretical framework, complemented by a methodological approach that combines thalassographic analysis with fine-grained ethnography, to study the relational and shifting mobilities of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers. By examining radical marine harvesting techniques and fisher categories in the context of growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood, the study seeks to illuminate the complex socio-economic and cultural dimensions of transoceanic expansion in fishing practices.\n\nThe research will focus on key nodal points, particularly shore-based ones, to understand the intersection between local and global scales. The project's significance is twofold: it offers substantial scientific value by contributing to the academic discourse on maritime anthropology and sociology, and it has policy value by providing insights that can inform sustainable fishing practices and regulations.\n\nTransOcean's groundbreaking work will redefine the perception of fishers as active agents in a global maritime landscape, thus shedding light on the intricacies of their livelihoods and the broader implications for international maritime policies and ecosystems.\n\nKeywords: Transoceanic networks, fishing practices, South China Sea, maritime anthropology, policy development."
