        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,\" aims to investigate the connection between economic hardship and the increasing support for socially conservative political agendas within the European context. Amidst growing prejudice towards marginalized groups, and the rise of far-right parties, this study seeks to bridge the knowledge gap concerning the reasons behind the concurrence of financial crises and heightened backing for these parties. The hypothesis underpinning this research is that economic hardship fosters narratives of loss, which in turn catalyze support for socially conservative political agendas.\n\nThe project will employ a multi-method empirical approach, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative research to explore the interplay between economic adversity and political inclinations. By examining the policy contexts at local and national levels, the study will elucidate the extent to which these settings influence such a relationship. The scope of the study encompasses five European countries—France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—selected for their varying levels of compensation for economic hardship, enabling a comparative analysis to uncover the role of context.\n\nRooted in a theoretical framework spanning political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioural economics, this research offers a comprehensive examination of the social dynamics at play. The findings are anticipated to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms through which economic strain shapes political landscapes, with significant implications for policy-making and the promotion of social cohesion."
