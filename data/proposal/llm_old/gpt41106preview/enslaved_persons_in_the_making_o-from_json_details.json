        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"SLaVEgents â€“ Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE\"\n\nThe proposed research project, SLaVEgents, seeks to shed light on the pivotal role that enslaved individuals played in the formation and development of societies and cultures in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By focusing on slave agency, the project challenges traditional narratives that often marginalize these individuals, recognizing them instead as crucial agents of historical change.\n\nThe project will explore a breadth of languages, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, to unearth the multifaceted identities, communities, and networks of enslaved persons and their significant contributions to the historical tapestry of the period. The geographical scope encompasses the interconnected regions of Western Eurasia and North Africa, offering a comprehensive analysis of the slave systems and their cultural interactions.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator and supported by a robust team of eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers, and three PhD candidates, SLaVEgents promises to produce substantial academic output. The deliverables include the creation of a digital prosopography to provide accessible, structured data on enslaved persons, a monograph, two collective volumes, fifteen peer-reviewed articles, and three PhD dissertations. Additionally, the project will host three specialized workshops and an international conference to foster scholarly discourse and collaboration.\n\nA dedicated website will serve both as a repository for the research findings and as a platform for engaging the wider public. The SLaVEgents project stands to revolutionize our understanding of slavery's impact on the ancient world, highlighting the enduring legacy of enslaved persons in shaping our cultural and societal foundations. This grant proposal advocates for the critical funding necessary to undertake this ambitious and groundbreaking historical inquiry."
