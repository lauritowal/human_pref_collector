        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative research project aimed at unraveling the profound effects of historical factors on contemporary conflict and economic development. The project is divided into two main parts, each addressing a significant aspect of history's influence on present-day society.\n\nPart 1 of the project focuses on the impact of history on conflict and economic development, specifically within the context of Latin America during its early colonization period (1492-1599). The research will utilize administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America, exploring their towns of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and the cities they arrived at in the Americas. This information will be used to conduct a within-country analysis that scrutinizes the interplay between institutions and human capital, and how they collectively shaped the trajectory of economic development and the emergence of conflict. The study will particularly investigate the institutional variations during the initial times of colonization and how they interact with human capital to influence outcomes.\n\nPart 2 expands the scope of the research by examining the influence of ancient conflicts on current ones. By constructing a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence, the research will analyze the long-run dynamics of conflict across various regions. This innovative approach will provide insights into the persistence of conflict over time and how deep-rooted historical disputes continue to affect contemporary societies.\n\nOverall, the proposed research will shed light on the historical roots of conflict and development, offering a comprehensive analysis from prehistoric times to the colonization experience. The findings are expected to have significant implications for understanding the complex relationship between historical legacies and current societal issues, thereby informing policies aimed at conflict resolution and sustainable economic development."
