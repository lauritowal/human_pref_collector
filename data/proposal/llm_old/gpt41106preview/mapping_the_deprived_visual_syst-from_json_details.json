        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction\" (MADVIS), aims to enhance our comprehension of the impact of visual deprivation on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex at varying stages of development. By investigating the interplay between crossmodal plasticity and the potential for sight recovery, MADVIS will delve into the adaptation mechanisms of specific brain regions in the absence of visual input. This exploration will utilize an interdisciplinary approach, integrating cognitive neuroscience and ophthalmology, to unravel the complexities of experience-dependent neural shaping.\n\nThe primary objectives of MADVIS include understanding the reorganization of the occipital cortex due to visual deprivation and utilizing this knowledge to foresee the outcomes of sight restoration interventions. Through this research, the project endeavors to bridge the current knowledge gap that exists between crossmodal reorganization and practical applications in sensory restoration.\n\nThe expected impact of MADVIS is threefold: firstly, it will significantly advance our understanding of how brain regions adapt to changes in sensory input; secondly, it will establish a connection between neural reorganization and clinical outcomes in sight restoration; and thirdly, it will lead to the development of novel predictive tools that can be employed in sensory restoration procedures. This project has the potential to transform the way we approach and optimize treatments for individuals with visual impairments, ultimately improving their quality of life."
