        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa,\" aims to explore the complexities of the global drug market through the lens of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The project sets out to investigate the pharmaceutical systems in Benin and Ghana—two African countries with distinct models—and compare them with the system in Cambodia, which is grappling with the issue of ACT resistance spread.\n\nThe core objectives include studying the supply and demand realities of the global drug market, analyzing the globalizing processes affecting drug availability and usage in Benin and Ghana, evaluating the public health consequences, and addressing the spread of ACT resistance from Asia to Africa. The project falls at the interdisciplinary crossroads of Anthropology, Epidemiology, and Sociology, providing a comprehensive approach to the subject matter.\n\nWork packages (WPs) are designed to cover various facets of the pharmaceutical market. WP1 focuses on the formal and informal pharmaceutical supply chains, while WP2 analyzes drug usage patterns. WP3 will study the extent of ACT consumption, and WP4 will scrutinize local production and regulatory frameworks. WP5 represents an opening into Asia, enriching the comparative study. WP6 is dedicated to project management, results dissemination, and the organization of two symposiums, aiming to ensure institutional impacts.\n\nThe project's goals are to foster reflection for the development of more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of ACT resistance from Asia to Africa. The training components are significant, with opportunities for 8 Master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 Post-doctoral researcher, ensuring the project contributes to capacity building in the research field.\n\nProject support is grounded in the principal investigator's (PI's) expertise in methodology and theory, reinforced by solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, ensuring a robust foundation for successful execution and significant contributions to understanding the global pharmaceutical market dynamics."
