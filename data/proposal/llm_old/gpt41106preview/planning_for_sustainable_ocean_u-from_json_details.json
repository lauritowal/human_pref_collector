        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change\" (PLAnT), addresses the pressing need for marine spatial planning (MSP) in the Antarctic region. Currently, Antarctica lacks any form of established MSP, which is essential for managing its unique and rapidly changing marine ecosystems. The urgency of developing an integrated and sustainable MSP framework for Antarctica is underscored by the high-velocity climatic alterations impacting the continent.\n\nPLAnT aims to tackle this challenge by focusing on climate change, a critical factor necessary for the effectiveness of MSP. The project's objectives are comprehensive and action-oriented: assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities, building future scenarios, supporting area-based climate action, providing dynamic solutions, conducting governance analyses, and fostering a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity. Each objective is designed to contribute to the overarching goal of establishing a robust foundation for MSP in Antarctica.\n\nGiven the contextual idiosyncrasies of political, social, and economic factors unique to Antarctica, PLAnT acknowledges the complexity of the task at hand. The project also considers the specificity of solutions as a risk, understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective in such a distinctive environment.\n\nPLAnT's potential global impact is significant. By inspiring nations to prioritize ocean sustainability, the project aligns with international agendas on environmental conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. As it addresses the critical need for MSP in the face of global environmental change, PLAnT promises to set a precedent for international cooperation and proactive management of marine spaces, serving as a model for sustainable ocean use worldwide."
