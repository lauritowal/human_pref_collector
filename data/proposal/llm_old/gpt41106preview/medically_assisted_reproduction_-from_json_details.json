        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: Medically Assisted Reproduction â€“ Impacts and Implications\n\nTitle: Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults, and Families\n\nThe proposed project seeks to illuminate the comprehensive impact of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) on individuals and families. Over the last four decades, more than five million children have been born through MAR, marking an increasing trend in its use. Despite this rise, existing research on the long-term effects of MAR on family well-being presents mixed findings with limitations in statistical power and conceptual frameworks. This project aims to address these gaps by conducting a thorough analysis of how MAR influences various life domains, including physical and mental health, education, and union stability.\n\nOur research approach is multi-faceted, involving innovative designs to establish causality. Using data from population registers and surveys, we will perform a first-of-its-kind exploration into the long-term outcomes of individuals conceived through MAR. This will include sibling comparisons between MAR-conceived and spontaneously conceived individuals, as well as adult comparisons between successful and unsuccessful MAR treatments.\n\nAnticipated results are expected to be ground-breaking, not only advancing academic understanding but also guiding future research. The potential policy implications are significant, with the findings poised to inform health advising, resource allocations, and the consideration of MAR treatment subsidies. Beneficiaries of this research will extend beyond academia to health professionals, public health authorities, and policy-makers, all of whom play pivotal roles in shaping the landscape of reproductive health services.\n\nThis project promises to provide crucial insights into the ripple effects of MAR on society, establishing a foundation for informed decision-making that prioritizes the health and well-being of children, adults, and families who embark on the journey of medically assisted reproduction.\n\nWord Count: 250"
