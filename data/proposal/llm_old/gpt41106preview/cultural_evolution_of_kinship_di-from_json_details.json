        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family,\" seeks to elucidate the complexities of kinship systems and their evolution across cultures and time. This innovative research initiative aims to unravel the universality and variance of kinship terminologies, family norms, and social practices through a multi-pronged approach that combines comparative phylogenetic modeling, corpus linguistics, surveys, interviews, participant observation, and elicitation tasks. \n\nThe project consists of three intertwined research components: VARIKIN-Evolution, VARIKIN-Usage, and VARIKIN-Development. VARIKIN-Evolution will analyze eight language families to understand how kinship terminologies and family norms change and diversify by employing comparative phylogenetic modeling. VARIKIN-Usage will explore the usage of kinship language in actual spoken and written contexts through corpus analyses, surveys, and interviews. VARIKIN-Development will delve into the acquisition and understanding of kinship concepts in children within small-scale, non-Western communities using participant observation and elicitation tasks.\n\nObjectives of the project include analyzing patterns of kinship change to determine their universality, examining the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, linking individual usage patterns of kinship terms to broader historical processes, and characterizing cross-cultural kinship acquisition among children. The approach integrates macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, providing a comprehensive view of kinship evolution.\n\nThe applicant brings a highly multidisciplinary background to the project, essential for addressing the complex interplay of language, cognition, and social norms in the development and evolution of kinship systems. By advancing our understanding of kinship diversity, this project promises to make significant contributions to the fields of anthropology, linguistics, psychology, and sociology."
