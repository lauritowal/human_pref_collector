        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time,\" seeks to explore the increasing trend of states ceding authority to international organizations (IOs), the variability of that authority, and the factors that influence the empowerment of these institutions over a defined historical period. The project will examine the steady extension of power to entities such as the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the constant authority held by organizations like the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO.\n\nEmploying a multidisciplinary approach that integrates political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, the research aims to build theory and test hypotheses about the dynamics of institutional empowerment. The design is comparative and longitudinal, focusing on the period from 1986 to 2010, and will analyze the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO to provide a comprehensive view of the phenomenon.\n\nThe study will utilize qualitative research methods, including archive research and elite interviews with national and international officials, to illuminate the temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design factors that influence the delegation of power. The project's objective is to offer new insights into the consequences of power delegation and to advance theoretical and empirical research in International Relations, specifically by developing a model of power delegation to IOs that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach.\n\nWith this research, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and outcomes of international cooperation and governance, offering valuable perspectives for policymakers and scholars interested in the evolving landscape of global power relations."
