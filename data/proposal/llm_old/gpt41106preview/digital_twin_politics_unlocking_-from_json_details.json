        "Abstract:\n\nIn an era of rapid digital innovation, the concept of a Digital Twin of the Ocean (DTO) promises to revolutionize our approach to marine sustainability. The project \"Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\" aims to critically examine the socio-technical processes involved in creating DTOs for national scientific and political purposes, as well as the implications of their deployment in international arenas. The European Commission's endeavor to construct a prototype DTO sets the stage for this timely research.\n\nThe proposed project will confront challenges such as time constraints, existing data gaps, and the need to integrate global sustainability goals for ocean protection. It also acknowledges risks including the potential exacerbation of global inequalities, legal and political ambiguities, and the possibility of abuse and misuse of DTO technology. Our approach will re-envision digital twins as socio-technical constructs and pioneer a novel, comprehensive methodological framework that melds qualitative and quantitative research.\n\nThe study will delve into the practices, policies, and politics associated with digital twins, focusing on their use during multilateral negotiations. We will conduct our analysis in three critical geopolitical contexts—the European Union, the United States, and China—to provide a diverse perspective on the global dynamics at play.\n\n\"TwinPolitics\" is set to break new ground by not only scrutinizing how digital twins are conceptualized and utilized within various governing bodies but also by evaluating their role in shaping international discourse and decision-making on oceanic sustainability. The insights gained from this research will be pivotal in guiding the responsible development and application of DTOs, ensuring that this cutting-edge technology serves as a catalyst for equitable and sustainable management of our oceans."
