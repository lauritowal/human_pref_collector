        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and amidst escalating environmental concerns, including climate change and biodiversity loss, foraging has seen a global resurgence as both a livelihood strategy and a socio-environmental entanglement. \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\" is an ambitious research project that aims to develop a comprehensive political ecology of foraging during the Anthropocene, a period marked by significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems.\n\nThe project will explore diverse foraging practices, such as the collection of yartsagunbu in Tibet and Nepal, scavenging of woolly mammoth ivory in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and the activities of 'Amazon nomads' in the United States, which have attracted patchy mainstream attention. These examples underscore the complex relationship between human societies and their environments, particularly in the context of economic systems that shape and are shaped by such practices.\n\nAn international research team based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, will carry out the project. This team, comprised of five researchers from an interdisciplinary background grounded in anthropology, will contribute to a body of knowledge through a variety of outputs. Planned publications include two monographs, three edited collections, and twelve peer-reviewed articles, which will offer a nuanced academic contribution to the field. Additionally, the project's public engagement will be facilitated through the production of a film and an exhibition, ensuring a wider impact beyond academia.\n\nThe resulting work will provide an in-depth understanding of foraging activities as they intersect with the economic and environmental challenges of our time. By elucidating the complexities of foraging within capitalist economies, this project will equip policymakers, scholars, and the general public with insights to foster sustainable and equitable approaches to environmental and economic practices globally."
