        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families\" (F-AI-MILY), seeks funding to explore the profound effects of artificial intelligence on the family unit. The project integrates interdisciplinary methods from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction to deliver groundbreaking insights into how these agents alter familial relationships and structures.\n\nThe objectives of F-AI-MILY are threefold: first, to establish an innovative group-centered mobile-lab approach for examining family neurocognition; second, to describe the developmental shifts in social dynamics that occur during sustained interactions with artificial agents; and third, to identify ways in which these interactions can support families coping with chronic illness, promoting a transformation from maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project will develop a mobile lab designed to assess the social dynamics within family units impacted by AI. This will involve measuring both behavioral responses and brain activity to gain a comprehensive understanding of attitudes and behaviors. Specific emphasis will be placed on child development and the long-term effects of living with an artificial agent in families with children aged 4-12. Additionally, findings will guide the development of AI agents tailored to assist vulnerable households.\n\nF-AI-MILY's unique approach combines the \"Neurocognition-at-home\" model with a full-circle understanding of the impact of AI on families. By leveraging an interdisciplinary framework, the project promises to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, thereby contributing significantly to the field and potentially shaping the future integration of artificial agents into the home."
