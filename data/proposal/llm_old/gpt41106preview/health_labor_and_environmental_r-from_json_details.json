        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe,\" aims to address the pressing issue of environmental quality improvement, which has become a top priority for policymakers due to global climate change and the increasing public demand for cleaner air. Recognizing the main origin of regulated pollution—specifically, the combustion of fossil fuels—this project seeks to develop innovative tools and methods to analyze the economic effects of environmental policies with a higher spatial resolution.\n\nThe project is divided into two main parts: the first focuses on the economic implications of local air quality changes brought about by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The second part examines the broader impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health outcomes, and migration patterns. By employing an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models, the project will incorporate both subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates.\n\nA key objective of this research is to provide empirical evidence that will inform environmental policy-making. In the context of climate policy and air quality management, the findings from this project are expected to have a significant influence on how these issues are addressed in policy discussions. By shedding light on the intricate relationships between environmental regulation, health, and labor markets, the project has the potential to make a large impact on global environmental problems and the focus of future policy initiatives. Its contributions will be essential for policymakers seeking to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability in the increasingly complex landscape of post-industrial Europe."
