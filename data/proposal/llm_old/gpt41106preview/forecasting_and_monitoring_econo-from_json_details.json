        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators\n\nThe economic landscape is rapidly changing, and the ability to accurately forecast and monitor key economic indicators is vital for informed decision-making among governments, central banks, and firms. Recognizing this need, our project, funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the Proof of Concept grant following the success of the ERC-2007-StG \"Change-Point Tests,\" seeks to create an innovative software toolbox that significantly improves upon current methods for forecasting and real-time monitoring of economic indicators.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a software solution that integrates novel model families and employs high-frequency information for real-time forecast monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. This software will offer real-time monitoring capabilities and predictive breakdown tests that are not available in existing forecasting software, thus representing substantial advancements in the field.\n\nTarget users of this software include governments, central banks, and firms who will benefit from the improved economic forecasts and decision-making tools. The project has already established contacts with forecasting agencies and a central bank, setting the stage for initial collaborations that will ensure the tool's relevance and applicability in real-world settings.\n\nKey development aspects of the software include user-friendly interfaces, three-dimensional graphical representations, and accessibility features tailored for decision-makers. The anticipated impact of this project includes the adoption of more prudent economic policies, fostering economic growth, and enhancing economic and social welfare through better-informed policy decisions.\n\nIn summary, this project aims to revolutionize the field of economic forecasting by providing a sophisticated yet accessible tool that leverages the latest advancements in economic modeling and data analysis. By doing so, it will empower users to navigate the complex economic environment more effectively, driving positive outcomes for economies and societies worldwide."
