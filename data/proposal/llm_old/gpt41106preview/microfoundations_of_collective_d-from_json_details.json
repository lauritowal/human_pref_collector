        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence\" project represents an ambitious initiative aimed at pioneering a research agenda that delves into the individual-level underpinnings of collective defence postures within NATO member states. The project's core objective is twofold: to spark a new line of inquiry into the microfoundations of collective defence and to execute a comprehensive, cross-national examination across key NATO countries. The methodology integrates cutting-edge approaches from experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology with a focus on individual citizens' perspectives.\n\nCentral to the theoretical framework are three components: the process by which individuals form attitudes towards allied support across varying collective defence scenarios; the way these individual attitudes coalesce into broader public opinion; and the subsequent impact of this public opinion on the decision-makers within allied nations. A series of hypotheses will be tested, including the proposition that strategic context shapes public opinion, the idea that direct armed aggression scenarios diminish the influence of public opinion, and the suggestion that ambiguous 'grey zone' conflicts amplify polarization and the significance of public sentiment in the policy-making arena.\n\nMethodologically, the project is set to break new ground through the development of immersive mixed-media experiments that are designed to be interactive, engaging, and lifelike, thereby enhancing the participant experience and the validity of the data collected. This novel methodological innovation is anticipated to yield richer insights into the cognitive and emotional processes that inform individual attitudes towards collective defence.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to redefine our understanding of the stability and credibility of military alliances. By elucidating the microfoundations of collective defence, this project could significantly inform the strategic considerations and policy decisions of NATO and its member states in an era of complex security challenges."
