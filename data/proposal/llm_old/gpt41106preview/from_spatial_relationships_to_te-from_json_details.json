        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding\n\nThe proposed research project aims to forge new frontiers in our understanding of predictive coding by focusing on the role of gamma waves within the visual cortex. Grounded in the frequency range of 30-80 Hz, gamma waves are critical for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, influencing a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our project seeks to unravel the complexities of gamma wavesâ€™ encoding functions and their pivotal role in predictive coding theory, which posits the brain's ability to generate top-down predictions and process bottom-up prediction errors to facilitate learning and the updating of priors.\n\nBy challenging the standard view that gamma waves primarily carry prediction errors, we introduce an innovative hypothesis suggesting that gamma waves might instead signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, with long-range gamma synchronization facilitating the prediction of visual input across cortical areas. To validate this hypothesis, we will develop novel methods to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies like deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), we will conduct experiments on both marmosets and humans.\n\nThe study will assess variables such as predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns, examining the dependence of gamma waves on experience and perceptual learning through an optogenetics approach. We anticipate that V1 gamma waves will demonstrate a reliance on top-down feedback, an expectation that, if confirmed, could provide evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. Our anticipated outcomes promise to offer significant insights into the fundamental mechanisms of brain function and the potential for novel treatments for various cognitive disorders."
