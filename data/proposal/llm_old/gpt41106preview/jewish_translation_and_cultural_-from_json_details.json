        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe,\" seeks to illuminate the significant yet underexplored role of translation in Jewish cultural evolution during the early modern period. Challenging the prevailing narrative that Jewish modernization constituted a sharp departure from tradition, this project posits that modernity was, in fact, shaped by the importation and adaptation of non-Jewish intellectual currents into Jewish languages. Through a meticulous examination of the translation of non-Jewish texts into Jewish vernaculars, the project endeavors to uncover the dynamics of intercultural exchange and the emergence of a new Jewish literary canon that engaged in a profound dialogue with the majority culture.\n\nThe project's central aim is to compile the first comprehensive study of these pivotal translations, providing invaluable insight into the nature of Christian-Jewish encounters at the dawn of modernity. By doing so, it intends to propose a novel paradigm for understanding the early modern 'Jewish book' as a site of cultural negotiation and transfer, rather than mere receptivity or resistance. The research promises to reshape our understanding of Jewish modernization, presenting it as a complex process of selective cultural borrowing and innovation.\n\nBy shedding light on the active role of Jewish translators in early modern Europe and their contributions to Jewish intellectual history, this project will not only fill a significant gap in scholarly knowledge but will also foster a deeper appreciation of the complexities of Jewish cultural transformation. Its findings are poised to have far-reaching implications for the study of intercultural relations, translation studies, and the history of the book in the early modern period."
