        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Inequality-aware Market Design,\" aims to pioneer a new theoretical framework that integrates concerns about inequality into the design of market mechanisms. Current market designs often face criticism for their potential to exacerbate inequalities, leading policymakers to intervene in markets through various rules that constrain transactions or distribute resources in non-market ways, such as rent control in housing, access to healthcare, and public transit systems. While such interventions are traditionally opposed on the grounds of creating allocative inefficiency, this project contends that inefficiency may be a reasonable sacrifice to ensure a more equitable distribution of surplus, particularly when inequalities are detectable and significant.\n\nThe project will employ a mechanism-design framework to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that explicitly account for inequalities. By incorporating a welfare function that maximizes welfare with redistributive preferences, the project will analyze how private information on individuals' willingness to trade and their welfare weights can inform the design of market rules. The main hypothesis posits that marketplaces may indeed sacrifice some degree of allocative efficiency for a more desirable surplus distribution that addresses inequality.\n\nThis research will critically examine the potential outcomes of such market designs, including the risk of inefficient rationing. The theoretical contribution of this work lies in its novel approach to addressing inequality within market-design settings, distinguishing it from the traditional mechanism-design focus solely on efficiency and revenue maximization. Moreover, the project will offer complementary perspectives to the public-finance approach through the tax system, providing nuanced policy guidance that explains why distortionary market interventions may be justifiable in light of inequality concerns. The findings from this research have the potential to reshape how policymakers and economists approach market design in an era where inequality is a paramount consideration."
