        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service (LaaS),\" aims to revolutionize the planning and management of city logistics by developing a robust measurement system grounded in public value. This system will integrate multi-criteria decision-making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization to ensure that LaaS infrastructure aligns with the broader public interest.\n\nThe first objective of the research is to establish public value as the core metric for evaluating city logistics, employing methods such as multi-criteria decision-making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. This innovative approach will provide a comprehensive assessment framework to guide logistics planning and management.\n\nThe second objective is to create foundational principles, models, and tools for the design of LaaS infrastructure. This will be achieved through network optimization techniques that will lead to efficiency gains and improved service delivery in urban logistics systems.\n\nThe third objective is to develop a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures. This will involve introducing logistics markets and employing learning-based optimization strategies to refine and enhance LaaS performance.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include the establishment of a new theory of city logistics that prioritizes public value, significant efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and the maximization of public value in city logistics operations. The implications of this research will have wide-reaching effects, providing scientific and practical insights for the fields of transport and logistics. Moreover, the project will address the social, economic, and environmental consequences of city logistics systems, contributing to more sustainable and equitable urban environments.\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to lay the groundwork for a transformation in urban logistics, aiming to benefit all stakeholders through improved efficiency, sustainability, and public value."
