        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the project \"In praise of community: shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979),\" a groundbreaking study focused on the performing arts as a result of commonality practices during the vibrant and transformative decades of the 1960s and 1970s in Italy. The project's primary objectives include studying, collecting, and contextualizing artist collaborations during this period, applying the 'will-to-the-common' concept to countercultural art, highlighting the significance of artistic communities both locally and internationally, and creating a digital archive of Italian artists' performances.\n\nThe project is situated at the intersection of historical, philosophical, and artistic debates and draws upon Sociology and Social Network Theory to inform its methodology. The innovative approach involves new modeling of performing arts knowledge and interpretation, alongside the development of an innovative digital archive visualization. This will provide a comprehensive approach to the collection, digitalization, restoration, and dissemination of Italian performing arts heritage, ensuring its preservation for future generations.\n\nINCOMMON, as the first systematic analysis of the performing arts field resulting from the practice of commonality, both theorized and experienced in the specified era, will contribute significantly to the understanding of how shared creative processes and collaborative endeavors shape cultural output. The project's outcomes promise not only to enrich academic discourse across multiple disciplines but also to engage the wider public through the accessible digital archive, fostering an appreciation of Italy's rich artistic legacy. Through this work, INCOMMON aims to offer a new lens through which to view the interplay between arts and politics, and in doing so, celebrate the collective spirit that galvanized a pivotal era in Italian cultural history."
