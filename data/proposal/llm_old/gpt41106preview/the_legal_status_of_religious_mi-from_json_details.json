        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Legal Status of Religious Minorities in the Euro-mediterranean World (5th-16th Centuries)\n\nThe proposed project aims to illuminate the complex legal frameworks that governed religious minorities in the Euro-mediterranean world from the 5th to the 16th centuries. Legal texts from this period are crucial for understanding the interplay of religion, law, and society. Our objective is to collect, publish, and critically analyze these texts to provide a comprehensive resource for scholars and researchers.\n\nThe project will focus on a range of religious groups including Christians, Muslims, and other minorities. It will examine various sources of law such as Roman and Canon law, national or royal law, urban law, rabbinical responsa, and fatwa collections, including specific sources like the Theodosius and Justinian codes, Acta of Church councils, and others. The materials will be studied in their original languages and translations will be provided in English, French, and Spanish to make them accessible to a broader academic audience.\n\nThe primary output will be an extensive database of texts and translations that will serve as a major reference tool. Accompanying this will be an annotated bibliography, the organization of workshops, and an international conference. The project will also produce comparative thematic studies, proceedings from the conference, a sourcebook of selected legal texts, and a monograph on the legal status of religious minorities.\n\nThe project's goals are to foster collaborative interdisciplinary work and to encourage innovative research that bridges traditional academic divides. By doing so, it aims to become an indispensable resource for scholars interested in the history of minority law and interreligious relations, as well as researchers in these fields. The target audience includes academics across disciplines who are engaged in exploring the historical dynamics of minority legal status and interfaith interactions in pre-modern Europe and the Mediterranean."
