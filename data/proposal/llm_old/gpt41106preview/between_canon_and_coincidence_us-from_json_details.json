        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Between Canon and Coincidence\" (BECACO) project aims to revolutionize the study of provenance within ethnographic and archaeological fields by employing a data-driven approach to examine the socio-politico-historical contexts that have influenced the translocation of cultural materials. Specifically, the project will focus on the provenance of Indigenous Latin American material and its representation in European collections. \n\nBy introducing the concept of \"Art World Patterns,\" BECACO seeks to build upon the original ideas proposed by Becker in 2008 (originally 1982), reconceptualizing provenance as a macroscopic investigation of the complex interplays between culture, politics, and history. Utilizing methodologies such as quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining, the project will analyze a substantial corpus of provenance data spanning 150 years (1850-2000) across 12 museums in 9 countries.\n\nThe resulting new models for provenance research will provide significant conceptual and methodological advances, facilitating a deeper understanding of how Indigenous Latin American artifacts have been collected, represented, and perceived in European contexts. The findings are expected to have a profound impact on the disciplines of art history, anthropology, and museum studies by providing a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the dynamics shaping art worlds. Ultimately, BECACO will not only contribute to academic discourse but also enhance cultural sensitivity and appreciation for the complexities of cultural heritage and its movements across borders."
