        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory,\" aims to deepen our understanding of economic inequality and its vast macroeconomic implications. Recognizing the complex nature of inequality, this project proposes a comprehensive approach to measure the economy at the granular level of individual households across three critical dimensions: Consumption, Income, and Wealth.\n\nLeveraging novel microdata sets, the research team will apply advanced heterogeneous agent models to depict the multifaceted economic behaviors and interactions of a diverse range of households. This approach stands in stark contrast to the traditional models that rely on the oversimplified concept of a representative agent, which often mask the nuances of real-world economic disparities. The project's methodology is underpinned by disciplined empirical efforts that are informed by the latest developments in economic modeling.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are manifold. By quantifying the micro-level heterogeneity that is pivotal for macroeconomic theory, the project will shed light on the inner workings of the economy that have been previously obscured by aggregate data. The insights gathered hold the promise of informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models, making them more reflective of reality.\n\nFurthermore, the project will provide novel insights that could lead to improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools, ensuring they are better tailored to address the underlying issues of inequality. Through its rigorous analysis, the project will contribute significantly to the ongoing debate on economic inequality, offering empirical evidence and theoretical refinements to inform policymakers.\n\nUltimately, \"Inequality in 3D\" will provide valuable lessons to policy makers and economists alike, advancing our comprehension of the intricate linkages between inequality and macroeconomic dynamics. The project's findings will not only enrich academic discourse but also have practical implications for designing more equitable and effective economic policies."
