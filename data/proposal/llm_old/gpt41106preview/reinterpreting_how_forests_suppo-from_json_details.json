        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\n\nIn the quest to combat global nutrient deficiencies affecting over two billion people, the focus has traditionally been on dietary diversification through increased agricultural production and access to calories. However, this project, \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries,\" aims to address a critical blind spot in current strategies: the role of forests in enhancing dietary quality for populations in low-income countries. Forests provide a multitude of overlooked benefits, including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which in turn yields essential food products like meat, milk, eggs, and manure.\n\nThe project has three main goals: to identify the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, to develop a comprehensive framework on forest-diet linkages, and to provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality. To achieve these objectives, we will employ a multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach. Our methodology encompasses a broad-scale perspective to explore the relationships between forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes; the identification of hotspots by linking household food consumption data with forest metrics; and in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes. Fieldwork will be conducted in two key locations to ensure diverse and applicable results.\n\nThe outcome of this research is expected to bring about a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of food security, recognizing forests as integral to the nutritional wellbeing of communities in low-income countries. By broadening the lens through which we assess and utilize forest resources, this project seeks to inform and transform policies and practices, ultimately leading to improved dietary quality and a more nuanced understanding of food security in the context of environmental conservation."
