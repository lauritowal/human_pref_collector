        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Swedish Historical Database Project\" is an ambitious initiative aimed at constructing and disseminating an unparalleled dataset that encompasses approximately 2500 Swedish administrative districts from the period 1749 to 1952. This project promises to transform research in economic history by providing a rich, granular dataset containing over 500,000 observations per variable. The scope of the data coverage is vast, including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social statistics, agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments.\n\nA standout feature of this project is its provision of comprehensive local-level data, which, coupled with an international perspective, offers an extraordinary resource for scholars. Importantly, this database capitalizes on Sweden's existing continuous and reliable population data series that dates back to 1749, thus enabling longitudinal studies with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThe research potential of the database is wide-ranging and includes probing questions related to economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development. The project will employ robust empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation, ensuring methodological rigor and credibility in the findings.\n\nThe project team has already demonstrated scholarly excellence, as evidenced by a related work currently in the \"revise and resubmit\" stage at the prestigious journal Econometrica. This shows the quality and relevance of the research that can be expected from the data curated by the project.\n\nFuture research plans include a deeper exploration into economic development and growth, taking advantage of the historical depth and breadth of the dataset. The Swedish Historical Database Project will not only serve as a critical resource for economists and historians but will also enrich the broader academic discourse by shedding light on the pathways of Sweden's economic development and structural change over two centuries."
