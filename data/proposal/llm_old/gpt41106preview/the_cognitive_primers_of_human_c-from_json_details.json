        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The cognitive primers of human culture: a comparative approach to the emergence of innovations,\" aims to unravel the cognitive foundations that catalyzed the ability to create and use sharp stone tools, hallmark features of human cultural evolution. This interdisciplinary study will define the innate stone manipulation propensities of three primate species—chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques—using advanced artificial intelligence coding methods. Through an experimental paradigm, the project will examine the influence of exposure and experience on the emergence of innovative behaviors, employing large sample sizes (N=350) and long-term testing protocols over approximately four years.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: firstly, to establish a baseline understanding of stone tool manipulation among non-human primates; secondly, to assess the impact of environmental and experiential factors on innovation; and thirdly, to trace the divergence of cognitive capacities between humans and other primates by comparing ancient human stone tools with those produced by our primate counterparts within the study. Methodologically, we employ a triangulation approach, blending empirical experiments with theoretical modeling, including the use of Structural Equation Models to analyze complex causal relationships.\n\nThis research is poised to significantly advance our comprehension of the conditions necessary for the emergence of innovations. By determining the cognitive primers of culture, the project will provide profound insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped the unique trajectory of human culture. The implications of this research extend beyond the realm of anthropology and primatology, fostering a deeper appreciation of the origins of human innovation and the evolutionary roots of our cultural heritage."
