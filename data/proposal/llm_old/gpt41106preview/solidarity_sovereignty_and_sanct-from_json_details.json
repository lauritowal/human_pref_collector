        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\"\n\nThis interdisciplinary historical research project seeks to unravel the complex interactions between boat refugees, states, and non-state actors by examining the global phenomenon of sea migration and asylum seeking since the 1940s. The central research question investigates how the interplay of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary has shaped the experiences and receptions of over one million boat refugees in various maritime contexts, spanning from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.\n\nStructured around pivotal periods of refugee movements—Jewish refugees in the 1940s, Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as Cubans and Haitians in the 1980s and 1990s, culminating with movements towards Australia, Yemen, and Europe by the turn of the century—this project will explore the dynamics of assistance and hindrance encountered by boat refugees. It will delve into the manifestation of solidarity among refugees on board, the encounters with non-state actors who offer aid, the response of states to refugees at sea, and the eventual attainment of sanctuary after the journey.\n\nThe project's innovative approach includes \"thinking through seas\" by prioritizing maritime spaces as central to refugee experiences, \"going beyond the state\" to consider the roles of non-state actors, and \"comparing across time and space\" to identify patterns and divergences in refugee experiences. These characteristics will enable a comprehensive and comparative historical analysis.\n\nTo accomplish this, the project will utilize a variety of sources, including interviews with boat refugees and both non-state and state actors involved in maritime migrations, oral histories, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage. By analyzing these sources, the project aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the historical patterns of boat refugees, providing insights into current debates on migration, international law, and humanitarian practices.\n\nUltimately, the project seeks to contribute to the scholarly discourse on migration by offering a global history of boat refugees that interrogates and illustrates the complex interactions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary across different eras and regions."
