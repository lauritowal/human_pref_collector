        "Abstract:\n\nThe METABODY project introduces a groundbreaking approach to understanding the complexities of our body image in a modern context. Recognizing body image as a dynamic construct, this research proposes the innovative concept of Body Imagining—a process that harmonizes prior beliefs with new information to continually shape our perception of our physical selves. This project is rooted in the idea that disturbances in body image may be intricately connected to both first and second-order metacognitive abilities—how we reflect upon and understand our own thoughts and beliefs about our bodies.\n\nAs society evolves, the negotiation between the invariance of our physical form and the invention of new identities becomes increasingly relevant. METABODY seeks to explore this identity balance through a series of empirical work packages focusing on Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making. Each package is designed to dissect the equilibrium between our embodied experience and the multitude of external and social perspectives that influence it. By examining how individuals make decisions about their bodies, considering current, future, and ideal states, the project aims to shed light on the metacognitive level of body image construction.\n\nThe overarching goal of METABODY is to deepen our understanding of identity negotiation, particularly in the context of body modification options. The findings from this study promise to provide critical insights into body image phenomena, opening the door to more effective interventions for body image disturbances and contributing to a richer comprehension of the human experience in its corporeal dimension. This project not only has the potential to impact psychological and social sciences but also offers profound implications for healthcare and the burgeoning field of body modification."
