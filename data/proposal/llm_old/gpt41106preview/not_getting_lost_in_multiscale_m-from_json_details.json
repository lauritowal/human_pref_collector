        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: \"Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management\"\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the \"LostInZoom\" project, which seeks to revolutionize the way we interact with multi-scale maps, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as crisis management. Recognizing the ubiquity of multi-scale interactive maps in both professional and everyday life, this project addresses the critical challenge users face: the disorientation caused by zooming operations that disrupt spatial cognition. Current cartographic design guidelines fall short in providing solutions for this issue.\n\nThe primary objective of LostInZoom is to identify multi-scale visual landmarks that serve as reliable anchors for map readers, ensuring a seamless navigational experience during zooming. Through a combination of cognitive experimentation, the project will explore how users perceive and interact with multi-scale maps. Based on these findings, the project aims to design innovative cartographic generalisation techniques and establish novel zooming interactions that are anchored around the identified landmarks.\n\nThe project's methods include rigorous exploration of map cognition, development of new cartographic generalisation strategies, and the creation of user-centric zooming interactions. By focusing on the context of crisis management, the LostInZoom project not only has the potential to enhance situational awareness among emergency responders but also aims to set new standards for map design that can be translated into various disciplines and applications.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project are to provide map users with a heightened sense of location and orientation, to equip map designers with validated guidelines for multi-scale map creation, and to ultimately support effective crisis management through improved cartographic tools."
