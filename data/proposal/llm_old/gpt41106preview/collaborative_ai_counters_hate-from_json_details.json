        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Collaborative AI Counters Hate\n\nThe current landscape of digital communication is marred by the proliferation of online hate speech and disinformation, presenting a significant challenge to social harmony and individual dignity. The project \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" aims to tackle these issues through the development of an innovative, collaborative bottom-up coding strategy to enhance AI-assisted extreme speech moderation. Recognizing the deficiencies in current moderation tools, such as the limited quality, scope, and inclusivity of training datasets and absence of procedural guidelines sensitive to cultural contexts, this project proposes comprehensive solutions to reform AI-assisted moderation systems.\n\nOur approach encompasses the creation of a global comparative framework for AI-assisted solutions, fostering a community-based classification model that engages fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries in a synergistic process. The project will leverage the AI4Dignity model to achieve several objectives: improving the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-assisted speech moderation, developing an open-access toolkit for widespread adoption, establishing procedural benchmarks for the industry, operationalizing the 'human in the loop' principle to ensure nuanced decision-making, and creating inclusive training datasets that reflect the diversity of global speech patterns.\n\nBy focusing on the target issues of online hate speech and disinformation, the project promises to deliver a transformative impact on the digital ecosystem. The anticipated outcomes include not only enhanced moderation tools but also a scalable and replicable model that elevates the standard for AI-assisted content moderation across platforms and communities. Ultimately, \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" envisions a digital space that upholds the dignity of all users through the responsible and culturally aware application of artificial intelligence."
