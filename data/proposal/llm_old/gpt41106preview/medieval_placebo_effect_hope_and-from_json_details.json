        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\" (MedPlaceboEffect), seeks funding for a comprehensive study of the psychological underpinnings of medieval medicine and healing. The project will focus on the period from 1100 to 1500 in Southern Europe, a time of significant developments in medical theory and practice within Christian communities.\n\nThe core concepts of this research include the exploration of hope, the expectation of a cure, belief, trust, and the placebo effect as they relate to the health outcomes of medieval patients. Employing a triangular approach, the study aims to examine the ideas, practices, and organizing structures that fostered a medieval placebo effect. This methodology promises to provide a multidimensional understanding of how the power of belief and the expectation of healing contributed to medical outcomes.\n\nThe goals of MedPlaceboEffect are manifold. First, it will identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect, thus opening a dialogue between current debates surrounding placebos and medieval perceptions of healing. Second, it will demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities during this historical period. Third, the project will show the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in the process of healing. Finally, it intends to examine the health system's legacy and its ongoing negotiation in the 21st century.\n\nThe implications of this study are far-reaching. It will deepen our understanding of the non-physical therapy elements in medieval healing practices and provide insights into the impact of the soul/mind on health. Additionally, it will offer a foundational perspective for contemporary examinations of healing practices.\n\nDespite challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming the influence of placebos in pharmaceutical research, this project promises to contribute significantly to the fields of medical history, psychology, and healthcare. By exploring the medieval placebo effect, MedPlaceboEffect seeks to bridge historical insights with modern healthcare debates and practices."
