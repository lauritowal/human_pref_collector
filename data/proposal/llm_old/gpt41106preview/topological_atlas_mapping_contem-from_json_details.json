        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes\" project aims to redefine the understanding of borders beyond their traditional, geopolitical lines. Recognizing that borders are porous for some and impenetrable for others, this research initiative seeks to map and analyze the complex and shifting nature of contemporary borderscapes, exemplified by the formation of ISIS and the fluctuating frontiers of Europe.\n\nThe proposed project will develop a transdisciplinary research program centered on the creation of a digital atlas, a medium that will embody our innovative approach to mapping, analyzing, and ultimately intervening in the discourse on borders. By employing digital and GIS technologies, including Google Earth, the Topological Atlas will leverage visual counter-geographies and participative methodologies to represent space from the perspectives of migrants and security apparatuses. The project will produce maps that illustrate seamless transitions and disrupt cartographic norms, thereby challenging the conventional representations of borders.\n\nOur methodology is grounded in the conceptual framework of topology, which will guide the production of visual and co-produced research forms that are adaptable to situations of crisis. This approach will foster an alternative model of researching border areas, moving beyond the limitations of top-down perspectives.\n\nThe central research question \"How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?\" underscores the project's commitment to depicting the lived experiences at borders. Through this lens, the Topological Atlas will not only contribute to academic inquiry and knowledge production but also impact the understanding and interaction with borders in the real world.\n\nAcknowledging the intricate relationship between academic inquiry, knowledge production, and the impact of knowledge, this project aspires to offer a novel, impactful means of understanding borders that shape and are shaped by the geopolitical climate."
