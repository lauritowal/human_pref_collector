        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"HealthyMom\" project represents a groundbreaking research initiative aimed at enhancing our understanding of maternal mental health in the wake of pregnancy loss, an area with profound implications for womenâ€™s health and future offspring well-being. The project seeks to illuminate the complex interplay between brain changes, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors following the traumatic experience of miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nOur objectives are fourfold: to investigate the neural signatures of terminated pregnancies in the female brain; to elucidate the reversal of motherhood-associated brain changes post-loss; to identify markers and causes of mental health disturbances post-pregnancy loss; and to unveil the connections among brain trajectories, environmental influences, and genetic vulnerabilities essential for mental health preservation.\n\nTo achieve these aims, we will employ a longitudinal approach, gathering data from women who have experienced early miscarriage or stillbirth. Methods include repeated multimodal brain imaging to monitor anatomical and functional changes, hormonal assessments to understand physiological responses, comprehensive mental health evaluations, whole-genome sequencing of participants and their partners, and detailed surveys to contextualize our findings.\n\nUtilizing advanced tools such as multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, we anticipate revealing female-specific brain dynamics throughout the reproductive cycle. Our research is expected to uncover neurogenetic markers indicative of susceptibility to mental health disorders and to pinpoint targets for interventions aimed at sustaining maternal mental health.\n\nThe implications of the \"HealthyMom\" project are substantial, offering a new lens through which to view women's health, particularly in the context of childbearing and loss. By shedding light on the underpinnings of maternal mental well-being, our research holds the promise of informing strategies to safeguard the psychological resilience of mothers, ultimately leading to healthier generations to come."
