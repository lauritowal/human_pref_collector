        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NUMEROUS)\n\nThe NUMEROUS project is dedicated to unlocking the enigmatic neural underpinnings of conscious perception, particularly focusing on the differential processing of visual stimuli that enter our awareness versus those that remain unnoticed. Building on our lab's previous discovery that even weak simple stimuli can trigger conscious reports when minimal frontal cortex activity is involved, particularly related to working memory storage, this research seeks to delve deeper into the neuronal journey of both simple and complex visual inputs.\n\nThe key distinction in handling these stimuli lies in their cortical processing routes: while simple stimuli are primarily managed by the visual cortex acting as an information relay station, complex stimuli necessitate a more sustained interplay between the visual cortex and associative brain regions, which are integral to scene segmentation and attention. Our research goals are ambitious: we aim to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across a broad spectrum of brain regions.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we will employ a multifaceted methodological approach. This includes measuring the activity of single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy via implanted electrodes and recording from a vast array of single neurons within an entire hemisphere in a monkey model. Additionally, we will characterize neuronal activity throughout most regions of the cortex and subcortex, utilize perturbation methods and functional imaging to construct a 'functional connectome', and isolate brain regions where activity correlates with reportable experiences.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the NUMEROUS project are groundbreaking, promising to provide unprecedented insights into how sensory stimuli are transformed into conscious perception. This understanding could revolutionize our approach to a variety of fields, from cognitive neuroscience to the treatment of disorders involving consciousness and perception. With potential applications extending to both clinical and technological domains, the implications of our findings are as vast as the neuronal networks we aspire to map."
