        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Truth and Semantics,\" is aimed at pioneering a comprehensive study that bridges the gap between natural language semantics, specifically truth-conditional semantics, and the intricate research surrounding semantic paradoxes. The project confronts fundamental challenges in the field of linguistics and philosophy by rigorously examining the concept of truth and its pivotal role within the foundations of semantics.\n\nThe objectives of the proposal are twofold: The first part, \"Truth in Semantics,\" is dedicated to developing robust semantic accounts for extensively studied fragments of natural language. This endeavor will entail a detailed analysis of the notion of truth and its interaction with crucial semantic elements such as modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. Such an exploration is essential for advancing our understanding of how truth conditions are crafted and interpreted within language.\n\nThe second part, \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics,\" adopts a metasemantic perspective to scrutinize the foundational role that the notion of truth plays in the semantics of natural language. This segment of the project recognizes the importance of truth not just as a linguistic concept, but as a cornerstone in the architecture of semantic theories.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is to produce the first systematic study that integrates truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective. By addressing these pivotal themes, the project promises significant contributions to the philosophical inquiry into truth, as well as to the practical application of semantic theory in understanding and processing natural languages. The success of this project could lead to substantial advancements in both theoretical and applied linguistics, potentially impacting related fields such as artificial intelligence and cognitive science."
