        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe during MIS3\n\nThe proposed project investigates the influence of climate on the extinction of Neanderthals and the colonization of Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. Focusing on 20 archaeological sites across the Southern European peninsulas, the research aims to assess the behavioural flexibility and resilience of these species under climatic stresses. By employing methodologies such as zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis, along with stable isotope analysis, the project seeks to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions that prevailed during this period.\n\nThe specific objectives of the study include developing a comprehensive understanding of the subsistence strategies adopted by Neanderthals and AMH in response to these changes, as well as formulating a procedure to estimate the ecosystem's carrying capacity. Through examining the species studied, the project endeavors to shed light on the subsistence patterns that may have favored the survival and spread of AMH over Neanderthals and to assess the impact that rapid climatic oscillations had on Neanderthal extinction.\n\nThe potential outcomes of the research are expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of prehistoric human ecology and the role of environmental changes in human evolution. The project's findings will have broad implications for the study of prehistory on a pan-European scale, providing insights into the adaptive capacities of early human populations and the environmental thresholds that influenced their survival. This research will ultimately offer a deeper comprehension of human resilience in the face of past climatic challenges, thereby enriching our perspective on the current and future implications of climate change for human societies."
