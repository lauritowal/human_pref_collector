        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era\" aims to explore the evolution of Buddhism through the lens of textual material in Indic languages from the first millennium CE. This period marks a significant phase in Buddhist history, characterized by the proliferation of textual and material culture. The research will particularly focus on the Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts, with geographic coverage spanning Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India.\n\nRecent discoveries, such as the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand, have unearthed a wealth of material that can provide new insights into the development of Buddhist textuality. The research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods to investigate the production, transmission, and relational networks of these manuscripts.\n\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive study focus on both the textual and material production aspects of the manuscripts. It will examine the content and its transmission modalities, while also constructing a relational network to understand the interconnectedness of regions and cultures within Greater Gandhāra.\n\nOne of the key outputs of the project will be the creation of a digital archive, which will serve as a repository for the manuscripts studied. Additionally, the project will develop an akṣara (character) database to facilitate the digital preservation of the texts. Editions and translations of the texts will be produced to make the materials accessible to a broader audience. The project will also feature in-depth studies on textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects, and will conduct a multi-language content comparison to highlight the interlinguistic relationships within the corpus.\n\nBy shedding light on a crucial period in Buddhist history, the project seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the evolution of Buddhist textuality and the role of manuscript networks in the religious and cultural exchanges of the first millennium CE."
