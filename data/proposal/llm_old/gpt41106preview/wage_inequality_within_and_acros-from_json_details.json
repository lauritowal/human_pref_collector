        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal, entitled \"Wage inequality within and across firms: The role of market forces, government and firm policies,\" addresses the critical issue of the widening wage gap in industrialized nations, with a particular emphasis on the persistent gender disparities that have marked the increase in wage inequality over past decades. By utilizing extensive data sources—ranging from German social security records to survey and administrative data covering a span of four decades—this research aims to dissect the complexities of wage inequality both within and across firms.\n\nThe project is divided into three focused studies. Project A examines the impact of market forces such as product market competition and routine-biased technological change on wage inequality. It explores how these factors contribute to worker selection, reallocation, and differential wage growth across firms. Project B shifts the lens to government policies, analyzing the effects of the introduction of minimum wages and changes in business tax rates on similar dynamics of labor selection, reallocation, and wage growth. Finally, Project C delves into firm-level policies such as family-friendly practices, flexible working hours, and child care facilities. It assesses how these policies, along with firm environment factors like the presence of co-workers with working mothers and egalitarian gender attitudes, shape mothers' return-to-work decisions and subsequent earnings trajectories post-childbirth.\n\nThe proposal is poised to provide a nuanced understanding of the factors underpinning wage inequality, and in doing so, aims to inform the development of targeted policies to mitigate these disparities. By identifying the roles played by market forces, government interventions, and firm-specific policies, this research stands to offer valuable insights into the mechanisms of wage formation and the persistence of gender gaps in the labor market."
