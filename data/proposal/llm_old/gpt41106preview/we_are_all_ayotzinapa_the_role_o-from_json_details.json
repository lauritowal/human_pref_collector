        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: We Are All Ayotzinapa: The Role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThe proposed research project examines the critical role of digital media in shaping transnational memories, with a specific focus on the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. This incident serves as a focal case study that highlights new media's significant impact on citizen engagement and the generation of counter-movements challenging the Mexican government's narrative. The project adopts a theoretical approach to dissect the ontological status of the disappeared and the role of digital memory in perpetuating their presence, while also employing a multidisciplinary lens to understand the long transnational history of disappearance across the Hispanic World.\n\nA comparative aspect of the research will analyze Mexico's case in relation to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, providing a broader context for understanding the phenomenon. The project aims to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope. Through this model, it will explore the boundaries transgression in digital memory and how virtual spaces serve as platforms for collective remembrance and activism.\n\nThe significance of this study lies in its potential to offer insights into the ways digital media facilitates the construction and dissemination of collective memories across borders, influencing social and political dynamics on a global scale. This research will contribute to academic discussions on digital media's influence on public memory and will be instrumental in formulating strategies for human rights advocacy in the digital age. The outcome will be a comprehensive framework that can be applied to various contexts of disappearance, providing a valuable tool for scholars, activists, and policymakers alike."
