        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society: Exploring Human-Environment Interaction in the Ancient Near East\" (CLaSS), aims to unravel the complex interplay between human societies and their environments in the Fertile Crescent over a period of 6,000 years, from 8000 to 2000 years Before Present (BP). Covering an area of 600,000 kmÂ², this innovative research employs a hybrid approach, integrating General Circulation Models (GCMs) with archaeological and archaeobotanical data to understand the dynamics of past human-environment interactions.\n\nThe CLaSS project will engage in archaeological data science and leverage big data techniques to construct comprehensive empirical datasets. These datasets will provide insights into population densities, settlement distribution, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies employed by ancient societies in response to environmental challenges. By focusing on these aspects, the project aims to investigate the factors that contributed to the differential persistence of societies in the face of changing climates, including both abrupt and longer-term shifts.\n\nThe research is significant, as it will offer a deep-time perspective on sustainability and the resilience of societies, contributing valuable knowledge to current debates on climate change and its impact on human populations. The project's findings are anticipated to have wide-reaching implications, not only for understanding the past but also for informing future strategies to cope with environmental changes.\n\nThe CLaSS project will fill a critical gap in our understanding of ancient Near Eastern societies by providing a nuanced picture of how these communities adapted to their changing world. Ultimately, this research will enhance our comprehension of the long-term human-environment interactions that have shaped the history of one of the cradles of civilization."
