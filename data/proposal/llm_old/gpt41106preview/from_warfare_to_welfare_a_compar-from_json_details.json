        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,\" seeks to establish a comparative framework to deepen the understanding of how combat trauma is shaped and managed within different national contextsâ€”specifically Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. The project falls at the intersection of anthropological study, combat trauma, biopolitics, and medicalization, and it critically examines the institutional responses to war-induced psychological distress.\n\nA multi-faceted research design will be employed, including ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, to investigate the complex ways in which combat trauma is perceived and treated within military and psychiatric institutions. The study aims not only to develop a nuanced comparative framework but also to unravel the shaping of combat trauma, highlight conflicting values in its treatment, and analyze the role of ethnicity in veterans' experiences within military and psychiatric settings.\n\nParticularly, the research will focus on veterans and clinicians as the primary target groups, seeking to identify key problems in veteran care and the impact of these problems on policy and healthcare systems. By advancing studies in the fields of biopolitics and medicalization, the project aims to contribute to a more profound understanding of the internalization of war-related suffering.\n\nThe expected outcomes include providing insights that could potentially influence care practices and policies for veterans, challenging resistance to clinical illness models, and shedding light on the institutionalization of combat trauma. Ultimately, the research seeks to make a significant contribution to the discourse on how military and psychiatric institutions engage with and shape the experience of trauma among combat veterans, with a particular focus on the intersection of trauma and ethnicity."
