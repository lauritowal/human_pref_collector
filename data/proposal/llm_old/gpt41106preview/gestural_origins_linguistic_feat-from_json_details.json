        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\"\n\nLanguage is a defining characteristic of the human species. Understanding its evolution is critical to understanding ourselves. The proposed project, \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication,\" aims to shed light on the underpinnings of human language by studying our closest living relatives, the great apes. This research will explore the systematic and meaningful communication evident in ape gestures, offering profound insights into the evolutionary trajectory of linguistic features.\n\nThe objectives of this study are threefold. First, we plan to examine cultural variations in ape gestures across different species, physical environments, and social contexts. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and adaptability of gestural communication. Second, we will investigate whether combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes, which will contribute to our understanding of the construction of meaningâ€”a core feature of human language. Third, we aim to compare gesture use and comprehension between humans and apes, with a focus on both adult and child populations, to discern shared and unique aspects of communicative behaviors.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, our research will employ a broad, Pan-African data collection strategy, encompassing 17 ape and 9 human groups. We will systematically analyze species-specific, environmental, and social factors that influence gesture acquisition and utilisation. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of signal combination in ape communication will offer parallels to syntactic structures in human language.\n\nThe significance of this research extends beyond academic interest. By illuminating the gestural foundations of language and their evolution, we can better understand the unique cognitive and communicative abilities that define human nature. It addresses the fundamental question of how language evolved and explores core language features such as social learning and syntax within the context of ape communication.\n\nThis groundbreaking project promises to make substantial contributions to the fields of linguistics, primatology, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology, offering a new perspective on the gestural origins of human language."
