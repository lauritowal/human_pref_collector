        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\" aims to construct an elaborate neurocognitive model elucidating how individuals create and convey common neural representations of the ever-evolving social world. The initiative confronts the conceptual and technical challenges that have long hindered the study of social information representation, particularly the prevalent use of oversimplified social stimuli in experimental setups. In response, this proposal leverages recent advances in brain signal analysis to transcend these limitations. \n\nThe approach is two-pronged: firstly, it involves the study of social interaction within naturalistic environments to capture the complexity and richness of real-world social exchanges; secondly, it entails the measurement of the temporal synchronization of brain activity among individuals to understand the shared neural dynamics that underlie social interactions. The project will employ innovative signal analysis methods, cutting-edge experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition to probe the hypotheses that synchronized brain circuits during social engagement are critical for mutual comprehension, that cognitive task similarities lead to synchronous brain activity, and that heightened emotional experiences amplify this neural synchronization and information sharing.\n\nAnticipated to revolutionize our grasp of the brain dynamics integral to social interaction, this research has the potential to herald a new era in social and cognitive neuroscience. By adopting a naturalistic neuroscience approach, the project promises to enhance our understanding of how shared experiences shape neural processes and, consequently, how we connect with one another in a deeply interconnected world."
