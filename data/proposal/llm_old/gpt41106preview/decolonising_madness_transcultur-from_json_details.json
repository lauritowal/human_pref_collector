        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering historical and inter-disciplinary project that seeks to explore the underpinnings of global mental health concepts and the emergence of transcultural psychiatry in the wake of World War II and during the period of decolonisation. The project's primary objectives are to investigate the universality of mental health and illness notions across cultures, to analyze the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, and to systematically account for the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences.\n\nThe research will focus on the aftermath of WWII, a key period marked by significant geopolitical and social transformations that influenced the development of mental health disciplines. Employing historical analysis and an inter-disciplinary approach, the project aims to interrogate how culture, race, and the individual psyche were redefined in the post-war and post-colonial context. It will examine the contributions of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe to the reconfiguration of psychiatric knowledge and practice.\n\nExpected outcomes include the elucidation of universal psychological mechanisms that transcend cultural boundaries, fostering an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and the development of new cross-cultural models of the mind. By addressing research questions regarding the redefinition of key concepts and the role of non-Western experts, the project intends to assess whether the new global and transcultural psychiatry frameworks marked a departure from colonial ideologies.\n\nThe study's implications are poised to reshape the discourse between Western and non-Western mental health communities, offering a revised understanding of mental health that acknowledges the diverse and decolonised narratives of the global psyche."
