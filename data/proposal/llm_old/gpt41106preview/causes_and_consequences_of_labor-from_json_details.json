        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility\" (LABFLEX) project seeks to delve into the intricate dynamics of the modern labor market, which has been profoundly transformed by globalization, technological advancements, and evolving organizational practices. The project's central aim is to investigate the underlying causes and far-reaching consequences of labor market flexibility, a phenomenon characterized by outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and pay arrangements.\n\nAmidst growing concerns about wage inequality and the unequal distribution of resources in society, LABFLEX is poised to address critical questions. These include determining whether differences in job contracts are a reflection of worker preferences or technological innovations, assessing the impact of contract flexibility on wage inequality and the gender wage gap, evaluating whether workers are adequately compensated for unfavorable working conditions or heightened income volatility, examining the extent to which job contract changes are indicative of shifts in the division of profits between workers and firms, and exploring the influence of labor institutions and market policies on labor market flexibility.\n\nTo achieve its objectives, LABFLEX will employ a multifaceted methodological approach that integrates linking register data with experimental evidence on worker preferences, analyzing a comprehensive corpus of job vacancy listings to extract job attribute information, and combining experimental data with structural econometric methods. This robust approach will yield new evidence on the determinants and implications of labor market flexibility.\n\nThe outcomes of the LABFLEX project are expected to paint a detailed picture of both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. By elucidating the nuances of job contract flexibility, the project will provide invaluable insights for policymakers, businesses, and workers, contributing to the development of informed labor market policies that can address the challenges of the modern economy."
