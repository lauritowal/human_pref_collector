        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics\" (Project BACKWARD) seeks to revolutionize our understanding of ancient human and hominid history through cutting-edge palaeoproteomic technologies. The project's primary objectives are to develop a new generation of palaeoproteomic workflows and to deploy advanced mass spectrometry alongside innovative bioinformatic solutions. With these tools, BACKWARD aims to address the phylogeny of African and Asian extinct hominids, extend molecular-based phylogenetic studies beyond the current limits of ancient DNA (aDNA), and reconstruct the evolutionary history of species that have been extinct for millions of years.\n\nEmploying palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry (MS)-based ancient protein sequencing methods, the project targets the exploration of phylogenetic relationships among early hominins in South Africa and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. These methods will enable researchers to identify and correlate key processes in human brain expansion and reorganization, and provide species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments.\n\nThe applications of BACKWARD extend beyond academic research. The workflows and findings have potential commercial repurposing, including diagnostics in forensic medicine, applications within the food industry, and innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. The project represents a collaborative effort among participating institutions, promising a transformative impact on the field of biomolecular research, akin to the revolution brought about by aDNA studies over the past two decades.\n\nIn summary, BACKWARD is poised to break new ground in the study of human and hominid evolution, providing unprecedented insights into our ancient past and offering versatile applications for modern science and industry."
