        "Abstract:\n\nThe FLORA project, standing for Sustainable and Healthy Food Solutions, aims to catalyze a significant shift in the global agri-food production, trade, and consumption patterns toward sustainability and health. Recognizing the intricate connections between agriculture, environmental health, and human wellbeing, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights that will guide transformative practices and behaviors across our food systems.\n\nAt the heart of the project's objectives is the ambition to create a robust evidence base that will facilitate the identification and implementation of the most effective, targeted solutions. This will be achieved by considering the trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics inherent in the global food system. The FLORA project will engage in activities such as diagnosing integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems, identifying key threats, and opportunities using system dynamics, and evaluating tailored solutions with a complex network and inter-disciplinary modeling framework.\n\nThe project's scope is global, employing a systemic approach that ensures comprehensive coverage and relevance. True to its interdisciplinary nature, FLORA will draw expertise from sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption sectors.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator with an excellent track record in interdisciplinary research, the project promises innovative outcomes that build on previous successes. The FLORA project is poised to deliver essential contributions to a sustainable and healthy future, addressing critical challenges in the global agri-food system through a lens of system dynamics and trade-offs."
