        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\" (SynSig), seeks to revolutionize the current paradigm of interpersonal synchrony in mental health treatment. Traditional views advocate that higher levels of synchrony between individuals generally correlate with better mental health outcomes. SynSig challenges this one-size-fits-all assumption by aiming to identify and understand individual-specific synchrony signatures and their therapeutic potential.\n\nSynSig's primary objectives include: 1) investigating the unique synchrony patterns of individuals, 2) exploring tailored approaches to correct deviations from these individual signatures, and 3) analyzing how such tailored adjustments can transform interactions into curative processes. To achieve these goals, the project will employ a range of multimodal markers, including motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression data, during dyadic interactions involving both human and virtual partners.\n\nThe project will pioneer the development of a multimodal feedback system, which will be the first of its kind to provide real-time insights into momentary deviations from an individual's synchrony signature. Through this system, the project will facilitate personalized changes in synchrony and will draw causal inferences between these changes and mental health outcomes.\n\nExpected outcomes of SynSig include the establishment of evidence for individual-specific synchrony signatures, new insights into the nuanced, multi-layered nature of synchrony at the individual level, and an increased understanding of the relationship between human interaction patterns and mental health. This project has the potential not only to inform best practices in mental health treatments but also to foster a new wave of personalized therapeutic interventions that recognize the uniqueness of each person's interactional style and mental health needs."
