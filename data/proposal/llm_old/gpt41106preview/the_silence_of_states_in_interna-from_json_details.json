        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering study entitled \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" which aims to fill a significant research gap by systematically examining the implications of State silence within the international legal framework. The project will explore the binding nature of State inaction, its role in establishing State responsibility, and the consequential impacts on international dispute resolution. \n\nThe primary objective is to construct a comprehensive taxonomy of State silences, offering a novel contribution to scholarly knowledge by categorizing the variations and delineating their legal effects. This will involve a meticulous analysis of State practice across the languages of the six official UN member states, an in-depth review of international jurisprudence, and empirical scrutiny of the reasoning employed by government officials and international judges. \n\nBy achieving a nuanced understanding of how different forms of State silence operate, this project will critically assess the adequacy of current legal norms and determine if there is a pressing need for change. The anticipated analysis will provide a baseline for legal scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to navigate the often ambiguous terrain of State silence and its ramifications. \n\nStakeholders, including States, international and domestic courts, as well as individuals, stand to benefit from the clarity this project promises to deliver. Enhanced comprehension of State silence will aid in the development of more consistent legal practices and, ultimately, in the fair and predictable resolution of international disputes. This research is poised to become an essential resource for those engaged in the interpretation and application of international law, thereby fostering a more robust and equitable international legal order."
