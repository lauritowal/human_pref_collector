        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThe proposed project aims to innovatively advance the understanding and promotion of active ageing by developing a comprehensive scale based on the World Health Organization's definition, exploring the factors influencing active ageing, and implementing a sustainable multicomponent intervention. Our goals are to create a new scale with dimensions of ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy; examine determinants and modifiers of active ageing; design and test a multifaceted intervention to foster active ageing; evaluate the intervention's feasibility and effectiveness; and analyze cohort effects on active ageing pathways.\n\nWe plan to employ a mixed-methods approach, utilizing counselling, information technology, and volunteer support. Our data collection will include a cross-sectional sample of 1,000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85, with advanced statistical methods applied for robust analysis. A key feature is the comparison of this contemporary data with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago to understand temporal shifts in active ageing determinants.\n\nA randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 200 will assess the intervention's impact. The aims of this project are twofold: to generate novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and to produce concrete evidence to support active ageing initiatives.\n\nThe anticipated benefits of this project are manifold. A novel scale for active ageing will be developed, contributing an essential tool for both research and practical application in gerontology. Young scientists will gain invaluable training and experience in active ageing research. Finally, the project will foster the development of new concepts and theories in the field, potentially guiding future policies and interventions aimed at improving the quality of life for the ageing population.\n\nOur comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach promises to make significant strides in promoting active ageing, with potential implications for individuals, communities, and healthcare systems worldwide."
