        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Intergroup toleration: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies,\" aims to advance the social sciences by investigating the social psychology of intergroup toleration. As societies become increasingly diverse, fostering harmonious living among different cultural groups is a significant challenge. This research seeks to address this challenge by exploring the psychological underpinnings of tolerance, the processes that facilitate or hinder it, the boundaries within which tolerance operates, and the social psychological implications of being a tolerated group member.\n\nThe project will employ a multi-methodological approach to yield a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. We plan to gather survey data to assess general attitudes and beliefs about tolerance across various demographic groups. Framing experiments will be conducted to examine how different presentations of intergroup interactions can influence levels of toleration. Furthermore, lab experiments incorporating EEG technology will allow for the investigation of the neurological correlates of tolerance and its limits.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are multifold. Foremost, it will provide valuable insights into the dynamics that govern intergroup toleration. Additionally, by identifying factors that promote or inhibit tolerance, our findings could have practical implications for policy-making, educational programs, and interventions aimed at fostering a more tolerant society. The novelty of this research lies in its systematic empirical examination of intergroup toleration, which is currently scarce in the field. This ground-breaking work is not only timely but also essential for understanding and improving the social fabric of culturally diverse societies."
