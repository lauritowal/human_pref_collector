        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\" aims to address the complex challenge of analyzing relations between social constructs such as values, climate change beliefs, perceived threats, political beliefs, risk perception, susceptibility to misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy. These constructs are pivotal in understanding societal threats in areas like climate, politics, and vaccination, but they present methodological hurdles due to their intangibility and the inherent measurement errors leading to potential underestimation of effects and misguided conclusions.\n\nThe key challenges identified include the non-direct observability of constructs, the variation of processes across different groups, and issues of measurement inequivalence that invalidate comparisons among constructs. For instance, the drivers of climate change beliefs may differ greatly in countries affected by extreme weather, and translation issues can hinder accurate cross-cultural measurements.\n\nTo surmount these obstacles, our proposal introduces a novel mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework, which will utilize clustering techniques to identify subsets of groups with shared underlying processes. This approach allows for more accurate and nuanced analysis by accommodating differences across groups and accounting for non-invariance with flexible measurement models. The framework's effectiveness will be demonstrated using large-scale survey data, providing social scientists with a more reliable method for examining complex social phenomena.\n\nThe development and dissemination of this framework will be augmented by the creation of freely available software, ensuring that researchers have easy access to these advanced methodological tools. Our project promises a significant advancement in the field of social science research, providing a robust analytical technique that can lead to better-informed policies and interventions to mitigate pressing societal threats."
