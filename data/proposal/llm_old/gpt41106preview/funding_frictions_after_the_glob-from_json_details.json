        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to conduct an in-depth investigation into the persistent and emergent funding frictions that have influenced financing conditions for a range of financial entities since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC), with a particular focus on the aftermath of the March 2020 Covid-19 market turmoil. The project aims to elucidate how countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies have been impacted by the changes in the financial landscape related to funding risk, which is critical for informing policy makers and aiding in the development of effective regulation and risk management strategies.\n\nThe key focus of the research will be to examine the manifestations of funding frictions, such as elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and the lack of credit market access. By investigating the effects of significant market developments post-GFC, including ballooning deficits in developed economies, tighter Money Market Mutual funds regulation, pension risk transfers to life insurance companies, and the implications of Basel III banking regulations, the study will provide an extensive understanding of the current funding challenges.\n\nThe research intends to answer pressing questions regarding the effect of these market developments on funding frictions and to determine the most effective policy responses to optimize the funding environment. The project will also explore debt management strategies for sovereigns and foster policy maker awareness of the potential consequences of regulatory decisions.\n\nExpected outcomes include comprehensive insights on funding costs, credit market access, and the identification of strategies to reduce funding risk for institutions. By providing critical information and analysis, the project will enable policy makers and financial institutions to better navigate the complexities of the post-GFC financial landscape, thereby promoting financial stability and resilience."
