        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital,\" seeks to fund a pioneering economic study that examines the long-term impacts of public policies and economic conditions on child development in Spain. Rooted in the fetal origins hypothesis, which postulates that early-life conditions have significant consequences on long-term health and economic outcomes, this research focuses on the oft-overlooked “missing middle” childhood period (ages 0-15 years).\n\nOver a comprehensive data period of 35 years, the project will leverage a large sample size and harness advanced econometric techniques to disentangle the causal relationships between policy interventions, income shocks, and child health and educational attainment. The scope of interventions and shocks to be studied includes fluctuations in household material resources, parental time allocation, medical treatments around birth, the availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks.\n\nThe outcome measures will be meticulously derived from hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores, ensuring a robust assessment of child health and human capital development. The study will also investigate potential channels through which these effects operate, such as changes in family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns.\n\nThe findings of this research are expected to have significant policy implications, informing the design of interventions aimed at fostering child development and well-being. By elucidating the complex interplay between economic factors and child health outcomes, the project promises to contribute valuable insights to the economics field and support evidence-based policymaking in Spain and beyond."
