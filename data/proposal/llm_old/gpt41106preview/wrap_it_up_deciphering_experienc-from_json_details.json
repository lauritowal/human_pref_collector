        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Wrap It Up: Deciphering Experience-Dependent Myelin Growth Across Development\n\nThe \"Wrap It Up\" project, formally known as WRAPPED (Wrap Research Assessing Plasticity in Experience-Dependent Development), aims to illuminate the intricate processes underlying myelin growth as a function of learning across the human developmental lifespan. With an emphasis on understanding how myelination changes in response to new experiences and learning processes, this project will provide critical insights into the biological underpinnings of cognitive development.\n\nCentral to our study is the novel assessment of myelin changes during critical learning milestones, such as infants learning to crawl, school-age children adapting to structured education, and individuals of various ages acquiring complex skills like juggling or a new language. By comparing myelin levels within the living human brain over time and across individuals, we propose to probe the entire developmental lifespan, offering a comprehensive view of the dynamics of myelination.\n\nOur innovative two-pronged methodology leverages the power of local longitudinal studies in conjunction with the expansive potential of large-scale open data analysis. Through the utilization of advanced MRI technology, we will visualize and quantify myelin changes, enabling us to elucidate the biological basis of our uniquely human learning trajectory.\n\nThe objectives of WRAPPED extend beyond basic science, as we aim to establish a vital reference point for understanding various psychological and neurological disorders associated with alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. By deciphering the complex relationship between experience-dependent myelin growth and cognitive development, our research has the potential to revolutionize therapeutic strategies and educational interventions, enhancing outcomes for individuals with learning and neurological challenges.\n\nKeywords: myelin, learning, development, MRI, neurological disorders, cognitive development."
