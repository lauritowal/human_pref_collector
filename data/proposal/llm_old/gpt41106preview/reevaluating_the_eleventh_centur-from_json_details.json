        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aims to innovate the way digital data for historical research is produced and managed. The project focuses on the development and testing of novel methodologies that will allow historians to reframe historical data as assertions linked to specific authorities. By employing a system that acknowledges the inherent complexity and often contradictory nature of pre-modern historical records, the proposal sets out to revolutionize the contextualization and reuse of existing online historical data, thereby addressing the challenge of data waste.\n\nThe proposed framework will enable historians to manipulate data with respect to its source and authority, and to link assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict, offering a more nuanced and interconnected view of historical events and entities. This innovative approach not only recognizes but embraces the scarcity of undisputed facts in medieval history, allowing for a rich, multi-layered understanding of the past.\n\nThe project will concentrate on the late 11th century (circa 1030–1095), a period of rich historical significance yet often overshadowed by regional narratives. By focusing on the eastern half of Christendom and the newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe, this project seeks to uncover trans-regional trends and influences that are not readily apparent in existing scholarship.\n\nDrawing on research disciplines such as Prosopography, Textual Scholarship, Corpus-based Research, and Archaeology, the project's goal is to construct a historical view that incorporates multiple perspectives within a traceable authority framework. Ultimately, this proposal aims to provide historians with the tools to explore medieval history with greater depth and fidelity, promoting a more comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the eleventh century."
