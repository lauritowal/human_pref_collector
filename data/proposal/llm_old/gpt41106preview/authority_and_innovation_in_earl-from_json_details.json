        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\nThe proposed project, \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56),\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy by delving into the intellectual contributions of early Franciscan scholars. This study challenges the prevailing narrative that early Franciscans were primarily engaged in the preservation of existing doctrine, instead positing that they played a critical role in the development of innovative philosophical ideas.\n\nAdopting a 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach to scholastic texts, the project will examine the interplay between theoretical constructs and practical application, providing a fresh perspective on how academic practice influenced theoretical advancements. The proposed objectives include producing the first exhaustive analysis of the sources, methodologies, contents, and subsequent medieval reception of early Franciscan thought. A significant focus will be to uncover the originality present in early Franciscan works, particularly their incorporation of Islamic sources, thereby illuminating the shared intellectual heritage of Muslim and Western philosophical traditions.\n\nIn achieving these goals, the project will delineate the transition of Franciscan ideas from their initial practice-oriented context to their modern interpretations, thus offering an innovative re-examination of the scholarly understanding of scholasticism. The expected outcome is a nuanced account that repositions early Franciscan scholarship as a cornerstone in the formation of contemporary Western thought.\n\nThe insights garnered from this research promise to have a profound impact on the historical conception of scholasticism, challenging existing academic paradigms and fostering greater appreciation for the multidisciplinary and cross-cultural exchanges that have shaped intellectual history. This project not only illuminates the progressive aspects of early Franciscan thought but also encourages a re-evaluation of the complex dialogue between faith, reason, and practice that continues to resonate in modern philosophical inquiry."
