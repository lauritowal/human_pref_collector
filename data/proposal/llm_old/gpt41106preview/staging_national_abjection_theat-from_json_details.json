        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive study entitled \"Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas.\" The proposed project aims to dissect the intricate relationship between theatre and the politics of belonging within Turkey and across its widespread diasporas, focusing on the period from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. With a transdisciplinary approach that melds theoretical analysis and ethnographic research methods, the project will scrutinize how theatre has been instrumental in both reflecting and shaping the contours of national identity and abjection.\n\nThe research will delve into a series of case studies that include post-Genocide Armenian theatre productions, representations of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas, Islamic theatre's role in Turkey and European diasporas, Sephardic Jewish theatre as it pertains to Turkey with transnational links to Israel and Europe, and Alevi theatrical expressions within Turkey and the European context. These cases will provide a prism through which the constitution of 'the Turkish nation' and its perceived Others can be examined.\n\nKey research objectives include: investigating theatre's role in delineating national identity, interrogating the political economy of Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal regime, probing the theatre's impact on the politics of belonging, analyzing the interplay between artistic and everyday performances of citizenship, enhancing the understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and offering insights into cultural politics after the dissolution of empires and in the face of illiberal democratic governance.\n\nThrough this research, we seek to illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, offering a nuanced perspective on how national abjection and identity are staged and contested through the medium of theatre. The findings are intended to inform both academic discourse and cultural policy, contributing to a broader understanding of the dynamics between art, politics, and society in post-Imperial and diasporic contexts."
