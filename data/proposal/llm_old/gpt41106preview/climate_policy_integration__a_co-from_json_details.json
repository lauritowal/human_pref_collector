        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project aimed at unraveling the complexities of climate policy integration within the European Union (EU) and its member states. Despite the EU's commitment to a net-zero target by 2050, projections indicate a concerning likelihood of missing this crucial climate goal. The project seeks to develop a comprehensive theory that explains the persistent challenges in coordinating growing policy regimes. The current lack of a system-level understanding of the synergistic and contradictory interdependencies between policies, alongside inadequate theoretical frameworks and research methods, motivates this investigation. \n\nThe methodology is multi-faceted, combining quantitative modeling of policy interdependencies, network methods, process tracing, interviews, surveys, comparative case studies, and advanced network analysis. These diverse approaches will enable the research team to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand the temporal dynamics of policy processes, identify system-level solutions, and simulate potential policy reforms for improved coordination and effectiveness.\n\nA comparative analysis will be conducted between the EU and selected member states to examine the coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The expected outcomes include not only insights and recommendations to enhance climate policy integration within the EU but also a broader impact by advancing the debate beyond climate policy to other areas of policy-making.\n\nThe research team brings extensive expertise in analyzing actor constellations within policy processes, ensuring a deep and nuanced exploration of the topic. Ultimately, this project promises to provide crucial knowledge and tools for policymakers, enabling them to navigate the complexity trap of policy integration and steer the EU towards meeting its climate commitments."
