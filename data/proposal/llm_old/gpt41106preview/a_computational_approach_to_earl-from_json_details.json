        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping,\" aims to develop a groundbreaking model that simulates the initial stages of language acquisition in infants. The model will leverage state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Automatic Speech Recognition techniques to mimic the complex process by which infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months learn language. It will be tested against extensive speech databases in Japanese, French, and Dutch, and validated through a combination of infant behavioral studies and neuroimaging techniques, including EEGs and fNIRS.\n\nThe project consists of four interrelated subprojects. The first subproject focuses on identifying both fine-grained and coarse-grained coding features essential for speech recognition in infants. The second subproject aims to unravel the process of word segmentation within raw speech streams, acknowledging the unique characteristics of the infant lexicon. The third subproject will develop a predictive model of coarticulation in auditory space through the process of reverse coarticulation. The fourth and final subproject will iteratively integrate the developed approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules, with a numerical assessment conducted on both adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases.\n\nAdditionally, the project will employ a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model. This will be supplemented by prediction testing using artificial languages and a longitudinal study, which will not only provide insights into the robustness of the model but also enhance our understanding of language acquisition in infants.\n\nBy bridging computational models and empirical research, this project promises to offer significant advancements in the field of language acquisition, with potential applications in early diagnostics and educational technologies, ultimately contributing to the well-being and cognitive development of children worldwide."
