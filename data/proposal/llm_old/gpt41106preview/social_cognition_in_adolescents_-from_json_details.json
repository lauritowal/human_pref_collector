        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\"\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious longitudinal study aimed at elucidating the dynamic interplay between the developing social brain and social network changes during adolescence. The project, titled \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks,\" proposes to integrate cutting-edge research in social network analysis with social brain research to gain a comprehensive understanding of social-cognitive functions in adolescents.\n\nTargeting a cohort of 1,000 adolescents across 50 classes, this study will employ a combination of social network analysis and a social neuroscience experimental approach to track the evolution of both brain networks and social networks over a critical developmental period. The project design includes six measurements over three years, with a subsample of 100 participants undergoing yearly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map neural activity related to social cognition.\n\nThe research will focus on two core experimental tasks: understanding others and interacting with others. These tasks are designed to probe the fundamental aspects of social cognition, and their neural correlates will be observed in the context of real-world social interactions. Ecological momentary assessment techniques, along with surveys and mobile sensing, will be utilized to collect rich, temporally dense data on social networks and behaviors.\n\nThis study aims to clarify how changes in the social brain are associated with alterations in an adolescent's position and structure within their social networks. It is anticipated that the findings will contribute significantly to the fields of developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social network analysis, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying social cognitive development and informing interventions designed to support healthy adolescent social development.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Social Cognition, Brain Networks, Social Networks, Longitudinal Study, fMRI."
