        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Shared Responsibility in International Law' (SHARES) project seeks to address the critical challenges posed by the current state of international law regarding the allocation and dilution of responsibilities among multiple actors engaged in cooperative actions. In the global arena, where states and international organizations frequently act collectively, the issue of ascertaining responsibility has become increasingly complex, often resulting in the undermining of the international rule of law and leaving injured parties without adequate remedies.\n\nThe overarching objectives of SHARES are to critically rethink the allocation of international responsibilities within cooperative frameworks, address the dilution of responsibility among actors, ensure the protection of the international rule of law, and provide effective remedies for parties injured as a result of shared responsibilities. This project confronts the central complication of determining individual actor responsibility within collective actions that can undermine key objectives due to the shared nature of responsibility.\n\nThe approach of SHARES includes uncovering the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and developing new perspectives on matching cooperation with a robust system of responsibility. The focus areas of the project are the principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, and the processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies.\n\nTo achieve these aims, SHARES will establish a conceptual and theoretical foundation while also employing an empirical approach through case-studies. This dual methodology will enable a comprehensive exploration of the problem and contribute to the development of solutions that ensure responsibilities in international law are appropriately shared and managed, ultimately benefitting the global community by reinforcing accountability and justice.\n\nSHARES promises to provide groundbreaking insights and propose significant improvements in the field of international law, thereby advancing the protection of international norms and the interests of affected individuals and entities."
