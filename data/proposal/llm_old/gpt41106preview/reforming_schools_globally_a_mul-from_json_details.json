        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThe REFORMED project proposes an ambitious, comprehensive investigation into the global proliferation and impact of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies within the education sector. Inspired by the persistent global reform pressures, this study seeks to dissect the nuances of policy adoption across a wide spectrum: considering a range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development. Prompted by the inconclusive and mixed findings in existing literature, REFORMED will explore four main questions: the dissemination of SAWA policies, the convergence of education policy internationally, the contextual and institutional circumstances affecting SAWA policies, and their ultimate effects on learning outcomes and equity.\n\nLeveraging a robust methodological strategy that employs both quantitative and qualitative methods, REFORMED will offer a multi-scalar analysis that is rare in existing research. The project will closely examine the inception of SAWA policies in global agendas, particularly under the influence of international organizations such as the OECD, and follow their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. The research will pay special attention to the effects at the school level, analyzing institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that involve actors ranging from international bureaucrats to teachers.\n\nREFORMED stands out in its effort to understand the promotion of SAWA policies on a global scale, addressing research gaps with a combination of methodological strategies that enhance the robustness and depth of the analysis. By dissecting the stages of policy analysis—from global agendas to localized effects—the project aims to contribute significantly to the literature on education policy and reform, providing actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders at all levels."
