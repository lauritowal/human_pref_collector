        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920,\" seeks to explore the multifaceted social and cultural landscape of late Ottoman Palestine. The study encompasses a crucial period marked by intense change due to imperialism, state building, and the forces of globalisation. Through a comprehensive investigation spanning from 1880 to 1920, this project aims to answer the research question: \"Which social strategies did late Ottoman Palestinians employ, across ethnic, religious, and class divides, to confront challenges on the individual and collective levels?\"\n\nThe hypothesis guiding this research posits that an accumulation of individual actions spurred the continuous formation and transformation of social structures within the region. The methodology centers on the analysis of census data and a comparative approach to understanding social practices across the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. By employing Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) specifically tailored for the Ottoman Empire, this study will provide a novel perspective on the regionâ€™s social dynamics.\n\nThe project's aims are fourfold: to contribute to the broader narrative of global social and cultural history, to develop a robust theoretical framework for understanding the impact of various forces on society, to establish methodological standards for such historical inquiries, and to enhance our comprehension of colonialism during the subsequent British Mandate. Ultimately, the project will elucidate the coping mechanisms and census-taking practices that shaped the lives of late Ottoman Palestinians.\n\nBy offering new insights into the societal mechanisms of an Eastern Mediterranean community during a transformative historical epoch, this research will expand our knowledge of how local populations adapted to the challenges posed by imperialism, migration, and social differentiation."
