        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries,\" seeks to advance our understanding of how unequal information and limited commitment affect trade in decentralized markets. The project addresses critical inefficiencies that arise when parties to a transaction possess unequal information, a common feature across various sectors, including financial markets where professional investors have an advantage over individuals, and consumer markets where buyers have private information about their willingness to pay. Standard mechanism design theory, which is often based on strong commitment assumptions and tends to focus on single-instance trading, inadequately captures the complexities of real-world trading scenarios, particularly those involving repeated interactions.\n\nThe project's objective is to conduct a systematic game-theoretic analysis of repeated trading in decentralized markets characterized by informational asymmetries. It will examine the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms and explore potential remedies to enhance market efficiency. By doing so, the project aims to contribute to the design of market institutions and provide informed guidance for market regulation.\n\nThe proposed research is highly relevant to repeated transactions in markets for non-durable goods and services, as well as durable but divisible goods, where such informational issues are prevalent and impactful. The goal is to elucidate the dynamics of these markets, leading to a better-informed approach to market design and regulation that can foster more efficient and equitable trading environments.\n\nThe insights garnered from this project are anticipated to have significant implications for economic theory and policy, bridging gaps in the literature and offering innovative perspectives on market efficiency and regulation. By addressing the limitations of existing models and focusing on real-world trading conditions, this research stands to make a substantial contribution to the field of economics."
