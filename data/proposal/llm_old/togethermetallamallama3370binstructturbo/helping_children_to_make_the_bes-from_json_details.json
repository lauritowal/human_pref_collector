        "Title: Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development, assessment, and implementation of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to support children's transition to high school. The ERC-team, backed by an ERC consolidator grant, will address key issues such as peer rejection, victimization, and low support from teachers, which can negatively impact self-regulation and stress-regulation. A.L.I.B.I. offers a virtual high school environment where players engage in prosocial interactions, practice perspective-taking, and consider multiple response options, focusing on long-term perspectives.\n\nThe game provides a realistic yet safe learning environment, allowing children to rehearse prosocial behaviors. Its appeal lies in the use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer. The project aims to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone game, assess its effectiveness, and integrate it into ongoing school transition trainings. In partnership with three school counseling organizations, the game will be implemented in three regions in The Netherlands, with plans for marketing and expansion to Europe. By supporting the development and dissemination of A.L.I.B.I., this grant will contribute to improving the high school transition experience for children, fostering a smoother and more successful adjustment to this critical life stage."
