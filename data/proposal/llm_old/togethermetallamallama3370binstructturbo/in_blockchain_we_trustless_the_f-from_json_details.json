        "Title: In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"BlockchainGov,\" seeks to investigate the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, bridging the disciplines of computer science, political science, and law. The project aims to analyze power dynamics, legitimacy, sustainability, and the potential for new models supporting decentralized decision-making at both community and global governance levels. \n\nThe primary objectives of BlockchainGov include examining existing blockchain systems, analyzing power dynamics, and exploring the potential for blockchain-based governance models. Through a combination of empirical research and theoretical analysis, this project aims to contribute to the scientific understanding of distributed governance and provide policy implications for global governance.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include opening a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing empirical and theoretical contributions to science, and offering policy implications for global governance. To achieve these ambitious goals, we require a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team, and a multidisciplinary skill set. By supporting this innovative project, we can unlock the potential of blockchain technology to transform governance structures and create new, more sustainable models for decision-making."
