        "Title: Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\nThis grant proposal, \"TransCorr,\" aims to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe during the period of 1750-1850. The project will explore the themes of corruption, political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, assessing the perspectives of both foreign observers and indigenous critics. By examining the motivations behind claims of corruption, including political, professional, and personal interests, this research will demonstrate how the idea of corruption was reframed over time. The project seeks to achieve four primary goals: constructing a history of the idea of 'corruption,' demonstrating the reframing of customs as corrupt, examining the impacts of Great Power interventions, and tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes. Ultimately, TransCorr will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between corruption, modernization, and center-periphery relations, reframing debates on patronage and graft in the region. By aligning historiography with scientific innovations, this project will provide a nuanced and interdisciplinary perspective on the history of corruption in Central-South-East Europe."
