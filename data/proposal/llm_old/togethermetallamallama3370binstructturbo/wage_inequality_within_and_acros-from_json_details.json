        "Title: Wage Inequality within and across Firms: The Role of Market Forces, Government, and Firm Policies\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the factors contributing to wage inequality within and across firms in industrialised countries over the past decades. Despite advancements, wage inequality has increased between firms, and persistent gender gaps remain, particularly upon the arrival of children. Our project will utilise comprehensive data sources, including German social security records, survey data, and administrative data, covering four decades. \n\nThe proposal consists of three interconnected projects. Project A examines the impact of market forces, such as product market competition and routine-biased technological change, on wage inequality. Project B assesses the effects of government policies, including minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes. Project C investigates the role of firm policies, such as family-friendly policies and flexible working times, on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth. By analysing selection, reallocation, and differential growth effects, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions driving wage inequality and inform evidence-based policies to mitigate these disparities."
