        "Title: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive social demography of widowhood, examining the increasing relevance of this life event in ageing societies. Despite its growing importance, research on widowhood remains underdeveloped compared to divorce, with limited understanding of its impact on mental health, economic consequences, and survival benefits. This project addresses this knowledge gap by adopting an innovative conceptual approach, focusing on the probability and duration of risk, as well as vulnerability to mental health and economic consequences. Utilizing high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, spanning 1985 to 2050, this study will investigate four key pillars: risk and vulnerability, social inequalities, country differences, and change over time. Advanced statistical methods will be employed to generate systematic and comprehensive estimates, providing insights into the challenges facing the widowed population and their family members. The research outcomes will facilitate new studies on sustainable pension and elder care systems, ultimately informing policies to support this vulnerable population."
