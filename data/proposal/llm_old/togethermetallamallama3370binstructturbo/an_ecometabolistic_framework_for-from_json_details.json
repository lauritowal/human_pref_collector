        "Title: An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal addresses the global crisis of material depletion by transitioning architecture to a bio-based material paradigm. The project's eco-metabolistic framework aims to develop carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions. Through research-by-design methods, we will investigate innovative materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. Computational modeling networks, including predictive modeling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing, will be employed to optimize design outcomes. The proposed framework challenges traditional design agency by introducing a concept of continual construction beyond building completion. Expected outcomes include the development of participatory practices, sustainable production models, and democratic models of production. By redefining the fundamental value proposition of architecture and reconceptualizing material lifespan, this project seeks to establish a new standard for sustainable building practices and contribute to a more environmentally conscious built environment."
