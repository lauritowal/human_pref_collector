        "This grant proposal, \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,\" aims to investigate the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas. Amidst growing prejudice and far-right party support in Europe, this project seeks to address the knowledge gap on why financial crises coincide with increased far-right support. Using a multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research, the study will examine the role of policy contexts and narratives of loss in five European countries (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) with varying levels of economic hardship compensation. Theoretical frameworks from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioural economics will underpin the research. The project hypothesizes that economic hardship translates into narratives of loss, which in turn trigger support for socially conservative agendas."
