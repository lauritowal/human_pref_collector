        "This grant proposal, \"Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain),\" seeks to create a comprehensive digital archive of personal letters from 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain. The archive will feature writings from diverse authors, including servants, children, and artisans, and will explore their inter-personal relationships and traditional community dynamics. Through systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic study, this project will provide a well-contextualized understanding of ordinary people's lives during this period. The expected output includes a large online digital edition, philological treatment, and cultural and linguistic study, adhering to Textual Criticism editing standards."
