        "Title: CRAFTWORK - Understanding the Relationship Between Identity and Work in the Future of Work\n\nThis multi-methodological, pan-European study proposes to investigate the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of 'neo-craft workers' across various sectors in the EU. The project aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the relationship between identity and work, focusing on subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, and cultural conceptions of social status. By combining digital methods and qualitative research, CRAFTWORK will provide the first comprehensive inquiry on 'neo-craft' work in the EU, rethinking interpretative categories for identity and work study. The project addresses the societal challenge of the future of work, exploring the role of social media, urban-rural distribution, and other factors shaping the identities and work experiences of neo-craft workers. Ultimately, CRAFTWORK seeks to contribute to critical studies of new forms of work, shedding light on the complex relationships between identity, work, and societal context."
