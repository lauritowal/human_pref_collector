        "Title: Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government (STATE-DNA)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the STATE-DNA study, which explores the evolution of government structures and their impact on policy. The project investigates two primary research questions: Why do government structures change, and how does structural change affect government policy? Building on the theory of evolutionary government, we hypothesize that government structures change due to the interaction between a unit's structural features and its organizational and environmental context, and that structural change affects policy as an evolutionary consequence managed by distinct units.\n\nUsing genetic measures and data assimilation techniques from biology, we will analyze a comprehensive data set of government structures from six countries, spanning 210 years (1815-2025) and comprising 150,000 units. The expected outcomes include a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy, a comprehensive data set of government structures, and predictive forecasting of future structural changes. The STATE-DNA study aims to contribute to our understanding of evolutionary government and provide insights into the dynamics of government structural change and its policy implications."
