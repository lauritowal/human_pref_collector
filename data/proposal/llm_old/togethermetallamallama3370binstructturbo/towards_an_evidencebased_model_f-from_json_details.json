        "Title: Towards an Evidence-Based Model for Big Data Policing\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive, evidence-based model for big data policing, integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions. Big data policing utilizes historical data to predict high-risk crime locations, optimizing police resource deployment and reducing crime rates. However, current models suffer from fragmented expertise, lack of interdisciplinarity, and insufficient scientific evaluations. Our project addresses these knowledge gaps by combining variables such as previous crime events, poverty index, and police patrol intensity to create a robust model. \n\nThe proposed model will be tested through randomized controlled trials, adhering to European and interdisciplinary principles. Four PhD tracks will focus on statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical aspects, ensuring a holistic approach. The innovation lies in prioritizing transparency regarding predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and legal and ethical standards, distinguishing our approach from commercial initiatives. The expected outcome is a validated, evidence-based model for big data policing, enhancing crime reduction strategies while upholding legal and ethical standards."
