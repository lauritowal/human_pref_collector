        "Title: The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\n\nThis grant proposal, \"The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives,\" seeks to conduct an in-depth study of the emergence of scale-based theoretical practice in physics and its far-reaching implications for our understanding of the world. The RESCALE project aims to explore how the shift towards scale-dependent theories has transformed the field of physics since the 1950s, and how this change challenges traditional notions of a final theory and unified understanding of the world. \n\nThe project has four primary objectives: (1) to examine the influence of the ideal of a final theory on modern physics, (2) to investigate the evolution of scale-based theories, (3) to analyze the implications of scale-based physics for philosophical interpretations, and (4) to explore the resulting world picture from a scale-based perspective. By combining historical and philosophical analysis, this project will reveal a fundamental epistemological transformation in the recent history of science, shedding light on the implications for our understanding of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics. The proposed research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex hierarchy of overlapping layers across scales, ultimately advancing our knowledge of the world and its intricate structure."
