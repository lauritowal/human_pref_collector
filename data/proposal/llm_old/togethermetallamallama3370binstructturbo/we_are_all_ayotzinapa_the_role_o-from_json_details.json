        "Title: We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multidisciplinary research project examining the impact of digital media on transnational memories of disappearance, with a focus on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The study will investigate how new media shapes citizen engagement and fuels counter-movements against government narratives. By adopting a theoretical and multidisciplinary approach, the project will explore the concept of disappearance as a crime and its representation in digital memory, as well as the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World. \n\nA comparative analysis will be conducted, contrasting Mexico's case with social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina. The expected output is a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. This project aims to contribute to our understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries of transgression in digital memory, ultimately shedding light on the role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance."
