        "Title: Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive study of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages during the early modern period. The project challenges the conventional view of Jewish modernization as a radical break with tradition, instead positing that it was a process of importing new ideas through translation. By examining the active engagement of Jewish translators with their sources, this research will uncover the intercultural encounters between Christians and Jews at the onset of modernity. The expected outcome is a new understanding of the early modern 'Jewish book' and Jewish modernization, highlighting the significant role of translation in shaping Jewish culture. The project will provide a nuanced perspective on the complex dynamics of cultural transfer and exchange between Jewish and non-Jewish communities during this period, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complexities of Jewish modernization and its ongoing impact on Jewish identity and culture."

It highlights how Jewish translators actively engaged with their sources, leading to a new, distinctly Jewish corpus that was in dialogue with majority culture.
