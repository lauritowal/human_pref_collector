        "Title: Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy. The project focuses on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, which account for differences in agent behavior and constraints. The primary objectives are to develop an organizing framework to distinguish between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents and to conduct a comparative analysis of HANK and other models, including Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) and Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models.\n\nThe analysis will delve into the 'heterogeneity wedge' in consumption or investment, aiming to understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates in HANK models and actual economies. The comparative analysis will focus on aggregate equilibrium dynamics, exploring the differences between HANK, TANK, and RANK models. The proposed applications include examining the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on optimal monetary policy. By shedding light on the importance of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the economy and inform more effective monetary policy decisions."
