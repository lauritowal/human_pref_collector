        "Title: The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the evolutionary origins of friendship, a crucial aspect of human health and well-being, with significant implications for public health and policy. Social isolation, a major risk factor for heart disease, is often compared to the risks associated with heavy smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity. To address this, our project will employ a cross-species dataset and social experiments to explore the evolutionary forces driving variation in social bonds across species, focusing on nonhuman primates, specifically macaques. Our aims include testing environmental factors influencing social bonds, determining whether understanding unrelated others' friendships is a uniquely human skill, and examining whether social isolation results from competitive exclusion. By achieving these aims, we expect to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary perspective on friendship, shedding light on what it means to be human. This knowledge will have far-reaching consequences for addressing social isolation and promoting overall human well-being."
