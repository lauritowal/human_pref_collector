        "Title: The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive study examining the causal effects of public policy and income on child health and human capital in Spain. Grounded in the fetal origins hypothesis, our research focuses on the \"missing middle\" period, a critical yet understudied phase of child development. Leveraging 35 years of administrative data and state-of-the-art econometric techniques, we will investigate the impact of various interventions and shocks, including household material resources, parental time, medical treatments, family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks, on children aged 0-15. Outcome measures will include hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. Our analysis will also explore potential channels through which these factors influence child development, such as family size, parental time use, and expenditure patterns. With significant policy implications, this study aims to provide insights for evidence-based decision-making, ultimately informing strategies to improve child health and human capital in Spain."
