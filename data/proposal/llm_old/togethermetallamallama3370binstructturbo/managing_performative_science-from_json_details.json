        "Title: Managing Performative Science (MAPS)\n\nAbstract:\nThe proposed project, Managing Performative Science (MAPS), seeks to address the lacuna in philosophical guidance on performative science by exploring its key characteristics and implications. Focusing on areas such as performativity in science, scientific prediction and explanation, and ethical questions in science, this project aims to develop a novel understanding of performativity and its management. \n\nMAPS will investigate performativity in various subjects, including economics, epidemiology, and machine learning, to assess the ethical risks associated with performative science. By providing orientation for the assessment and management of performative science, this project will contribute to the philosophy of science and offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. \n\nUltimately, MAPS aims to close the gap in philosophical guidance on performative science, ensuring that scientific advancements are made with consideration for their potential impact and ethical implications. This project has the potential to make a significant contribution to our understanding of performativity in science and its responsible management."
