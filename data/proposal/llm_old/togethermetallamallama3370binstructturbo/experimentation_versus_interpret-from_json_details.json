        "Title: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize music performance by shifting the focus from traditional text-based works to performative-based musical creations. The project, hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, aims to investigate the limitations of historical conceptions of music performance and create new paths through experimental practices. By applying a scientific experimentation model to music performance, this research endeavors to assess the transferability of such approaches to the artistic realm.\n\nThrough material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of innovative artistic outputs, this project expects to contribute to innovations in theory and practice, providing opportunities for scholarship and performance practices. Theoretical investigation and music practice will be the primary practical components, yielding concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. Ultimately, this research strives to bring about a change in the field of musical performance, offering a fresh alternative to traditional interpretation. By exploring the intersection of artistic experimentation and music performance, this project has the potential to redefine the boundaries of music creation and execution in the twenty-first century."
