        "Title: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore how non-human beings, such as animals and plants, shape human cultural life in the Amazon River Basin through the lens of cultural productions, including texts, cinema, and art. The project, guided by the concept of \"zoophytography,\" hypothesizes that these productions highlight the dynamic role of non-human entities in human cultural life. The main challenge is to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants. The project consists of three research streams: formulating a definition of zoophytography and tracing its roots, examining the articulation of animals in cultural productions, and exploring plant inscription in texts, cinema, and artworks. This project contributes to environmental humanities, ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, revealing interdependence between humans and non-humans, and drawing attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia. By decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making, this project aims to uncover equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants."
