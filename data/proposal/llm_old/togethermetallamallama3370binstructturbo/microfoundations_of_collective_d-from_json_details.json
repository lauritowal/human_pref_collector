        "Title: Microfoundations of Collective Defence\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence, focusing on the views of individuals in key NATO member states. By employing experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology approaches, our project aims to conduct an extensive, cross-national investigation into the formation of attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios. Our theoretical model explores how individual attitudes aggregate to form public opinion and influence decision-makers in allied states. We hypothesize that strategic context impacts public opinion formation, with conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limiting the role of public opinion, while ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making.\n\nOur methodological innovation lies in the use of novel immersive mixed-media experiments, providing participants with an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience. The findings of this project could have significant policy implications, potentially redefining the stability and credibility of military alliances. By examining the microfoundations of collective defence, our research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics underlying international cooperation and conflict resolution."
