        "Title: METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining, which captures the dynamic interplay between prior expectations and new information to form body image. METABODY aims to investigate the metacognitive level of body image as a dynamic inference, balancing prior beliefs and new information. We hypothesize that body image disturbances are related to first- and second-order abilities, including metacognition and mentalization. \n\nThe project consists of three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making. These packages will explore the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives, social perspectives, and current, future, and ideal body perspectives, respectively. By examining the negotiation between invariance and invention in the modern context, METABODY seeks to understand identity negotiation in the context of body modification options. The ultimate goal is to advance our understanding of body image phenomena and its implications for identity balance, with significant potential for applications in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and healthcare."
