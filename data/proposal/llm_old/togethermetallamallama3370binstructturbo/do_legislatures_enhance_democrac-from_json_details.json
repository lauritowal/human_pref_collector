        "Title: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, exploring the research question of whether these institutions have the potential to enhance democracy. Despite the prevalence of elections and multi-party systems in these countries, the relationship between legislatures and democratic development remains poorly understood. Our project will adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data types and analysis techniques such as content analysis, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. We will focus on three key areas: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness. The study will cover seven African countries, leveraging a strong team of partner institutions to collect extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior. By addressing the challenges posed by the opaque nature of authoritarian regimes and limited research on African cases, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential for legislatures to enhance democracy in these contexts. The expected outcome is a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, shedding light on their potential to promote democratic development."
