        "Title: Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\nThis grant proposal explores the intersection of technology, corporate governance, and social issues. The project consists of three pillars: (1) examining the impact of virtual-only shareholder meetings on communication with shareholders, (2) investigating the relationship between firms' stated and actual actions on environmental and social (ES) issues, and (3) analyzing the connection between employee characteristics and their ability to maximize Employee Benefit Compensation (EBC) value, with a specific focus on the tech industry and gender disparities.\n\nInitial findings suggest that the shift to virtual-only meetings has minimized shareholder communication, while natural language processing analysis reveals that investors reward firms for stated ES actions rather than actual actions. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of technology on corporate governance, ES issues, and employee welfare, ultimately informing strategies to promote transparency, accountability, and prosperity for investors and individuals. The expected outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationships between technology, corporations, and societal well-being."
