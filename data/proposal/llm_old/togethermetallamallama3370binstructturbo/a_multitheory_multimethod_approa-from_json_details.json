        "Title: A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal addresses the pressing issue of radicalization leading to violence, a priority during the UN Decade of Action (2020-2030). The project tackles existing shortcomings in theoretical consensus, empirical access, and methodological limitations in radicalization research. Our approach combines multiple theories and methods to develop a comprehensive model of radicalization and deradicalization. The project consists of four work packages: (1) developing a multi-theory model, (2) designing an innovative methodology for data collection, (3) conducting interviews and experiments in 10 countries (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri-Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan), and (4) creating evidence-based programs for prevention and deradicalization in prisons. This project will contribute to the scientific understanding of radicalization by collecting unique empirical data from violent extremist offenders worldwide and provide novel evidence-based strategies for predicting and preventing violent extremism. By addressing the complex issue of radicalization, this project aims to inform effective prevention and intervention policies, ultimately reducing the threat of violent extremism globally."
