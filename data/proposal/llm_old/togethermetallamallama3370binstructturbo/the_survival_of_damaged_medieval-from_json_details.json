        "Title: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics (POLYCHROME)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the POLYCHROME project, an interdisciplinary study focusing on the preservation and transformation of medieval polychromed heritage in the Nordic region (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) since the Reformation. The project will investigate the current state, historical context, and risk factors affecting painted and gilded Christian images, wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces. Contrary to current assumptions that damages are primarily due to accidents or unspecific vandalism, our hypothesis suggests that many damages are linked to iconoclastic acts during the Reformation, such as those following the breaks with the church in Rome in Sweden (1527) and Denmark-Norway (1537).\n\nBy employing technologies from the natural sciences, we aim to conduct an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collect material data, map restorations and repairs, and establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism on Nordic cultural heritage and informed training priorities for future conservation efforts. This project addresses a significant research gap in the field, providing new insights into the complex history and preservation challenges of these valuable cultural artifacts."
