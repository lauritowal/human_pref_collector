        "This grant proposal, \"Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920,\" seeks to explore the social strategies employed by late Ottoman Palestinians to confront challenges across ethnic, religious, and class divides. The project will investigate the period between 1880 and 1920, examining the impact of imperialism, globalization, and Ottoman state building on social differentiation, human mobility, and migration. By analyzing census data and comparing social practices across the region and beyond, this research aims to contribute to global social and cultural history, develop a theoretical framework, and establish methodological standards. The ultimate goal is to understand how individual actions led to the emergence and re-emergence of social formations, shedding light on the complexities of colonialism under the British Mandate. The project will also utilize Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS) to map the Ottoman Empire, providing a unique perspective on the region's social and cultural dynamics."
