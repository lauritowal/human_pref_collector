        "Title: Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, with a focus on the role of dopaminergic substrates and neural activity in brain reward circuits. Our hypothesis is that the drive to eat is modulated by sensory feedback and post-ingestive information about energy content, which is transmitted to the brain via the vagus nerve. Using a combination of computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation, we will study this phenomenon in both rodents and humans. Our experiments will include human probabilistic decision-making tasks to examine the selection of food based on post-ingestive information. We will also explore the implications of our findings in the context of obesity, a condition characterized by dysregulated eating behavior. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking behavior, this project aims to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for obesity and other eating disorders."
