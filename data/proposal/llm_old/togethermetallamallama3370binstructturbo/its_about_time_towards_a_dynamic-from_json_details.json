        "Title: It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\n\nThis grant proposal, \"It's about time,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of natural vision by studying it in a more dynamic and ecologically valid setting. The project's objective is to investigate vision as an active process geared towards semantic understanding, exploring how the brain samples information and analyzes visual data across multiple timeframes. \n\nAn interdisciplinary approach will be employed, combining non-invasive human brain imaging, multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modeling. The methods will involve visual exploration of thousands of natural scenes, development of novel analysis techniques, and creation of a bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision.\n\nThe project aims to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain and integrate information from the world in a dynamic decision process. The expected impact is a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision, providing new insights into complex neural processes and aligning biological and synthetic vision more closely. The proposed research has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of higher-level vision and its underlying mechanisms."
