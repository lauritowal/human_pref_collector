        "This grant proposal, titled \"Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences,\" aims to develop a novel framework for analyzing household consumption patterns. By employing a non-unitary modeling approach and nonparametric revealed preference methodology, this project seeks to open the \"intrahousehold black box\" and uncover the decision-making processes within households. The proposed research integrates marriage market dynamics into structural modeling and combines revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems. Key objectives include avoiding parametric assumptions on decision processes and describing the intrahousehold decision process using aggregate consumption information. This project addresses challenges related to unobserved heterogeneity and limited power of revealed preference restrictions, leveraging pooled cross-section data sets to inform empirical analysis. The expected outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of household consumption and decision-making, with implications for policy and economic research."
