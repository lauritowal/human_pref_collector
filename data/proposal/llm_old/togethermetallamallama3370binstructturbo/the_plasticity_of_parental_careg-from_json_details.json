        "Title: The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the neural basis of parental caregiving, exploring both normal development and disruptions to this critical process. Our longitudinal study will track brain changes in new parents from pre-pregnancy onwards, utilizing neuroimaging and psychological testing to examine structural and functional brain changes, as well as behavioral measures of caregiving tasks. We will also conduct a cross-sectional study to examine the effects of disruptions, such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities, on brain and behavioral aspects of caregiving. A third subproject will employ advanced computational models to synthesize findings and identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying parenting development. By characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted parental caregiving, this project aims to advance our understanding of this complex and essential process, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to support new parents and promote healthy family relationships."
