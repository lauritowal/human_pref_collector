        "Title: Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of human cognition through the study of complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. The project aims to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds the limitations of current context-free grammars, focusing on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints. \n\nThe proposed research will consist of three interconnected strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental. The theoretical strand will develop a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars. The computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, utilizing the unified syntax theory for training and evaluation. The experimental strand will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, with a focus on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension.\n\nThis project will contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences, providing new insights into the complex processes underlying human music perception and cognition. By integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, this research will significantly advance our understanding of musical structure building and its implications for human cognition."
