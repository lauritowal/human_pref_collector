        "Title: Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\n\nThis grant proposal, \"MedPlaceboEffect,\" seeks to explore the concept of the placebo effect in medieval medicine and healing practices in Southern Europe between 1100-1500. By adopting a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures, this project aims to identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect and demonstrate its pervasiveness in medieval healthcare. The core concepts of hope, expectation for cure, belief, trust, and the placebo effect will be investigated to understand their impact on health outcomes.\n\nThe project's goals include facilitating a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions of the placebo effect, as well as examining the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing. By doing so, this research will provide insights into the understanding of therapy elements in medieval healing, the impact of the soul/mind on health, and lay the foundation for contemporary examination of healing practices. Ultimately, this project will contribute to addressing modern challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, shedding light on the complex legacy of medieval healthcare systems and their negotiation in the 21st century."
