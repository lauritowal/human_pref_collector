        "Title: Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDE)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDE) project, which aims to revolutionize our understanding of language by moving beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches. The project challenges Western linguistic thinking, which has been dominated by alphabet-centric perspectives for over 3,000 years. By leveraging wide learning networks with two-layer structures and simple error-driven learning rules, we will explore how languages utilize low-level acoustic signal properties to convey meaning. Our research goals include advancing auditory comprehension development, modeling diverse languages, extending speech production capabilities, and developing a discrimination-based language theory. The proposed project has the potential to significantly impact the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and we believe that our innovative approach will yield groundbreaking insights into the complexities of human language processing."
