        "Title: Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a transdisciplinary research program focused on mapping, analyzing, and intervening in contemporary borderscapes. The project, \"Topological Atlas,\" aims to challenge traditional cartographic norms by representing borders as topological entities, emphasizing their porous, shifting, and solidified characteristics. Through a participative and visual counter-geographies approach, this project will utilize digital technologies, GIS technology, and Google Earth to produce seamless maps of border transitions, highlighting the experiences of migrants and security apparatuses.\n\nThe research question guiding this project is: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them? By adopting a topology-based conceptual framework, this project will disrupt cartographic norms and provide a unique perspective on the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations, operation beyond legal frameworks, and variable enforcement of treaties. The proposed digital atlas will serve as a medium for co-produced, visual research, adapting to situations of crisis and researching border areas beyond top-down perspectives. This innovative project has the potential to impact our understanding of borders and their impact on individuals and communities, ultimately informing more effective and humane border policies."
