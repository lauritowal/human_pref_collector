        "This grant proposal, \"Florilegia Syriaca,\" seeks to explore the intercultural dissemination of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic during the first millennium CE. The project focuses on the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought in these languages, with a particular emphasis on the cultural mediation of Syriac Christianity. Despite its historical significance, this aspect of Christian heritage is little-known today. The proposal aims to illuminate Syriac and Christian Arabic sources, define the religious identity of Syriac Christians, and create open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia. By studying the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors, this project will provide groundbreaking insights into the cultural creativity laboratories of Syriac florilegia and their role in shaping the patristic canon during the 2nd-6th centuries. The expected outcomes include an improved understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity, a deeper comprehension of Europe's current religious discourses, and the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians. Ultimately, this project will highlight the significance of Syriac Christianity as a bridge between the intellectual history of Europe and the Middle East."
