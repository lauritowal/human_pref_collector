        "Title: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\n\nThis grant proposal, \"ReAct,\" seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cultural memory of protest in Europe since the late 19th century. The project aims to reveal the continuities and changes in protest depiction across different media regimes, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying memory of protest, and show how memory of protest feeds back into later movements. \n\nThe study will focus on three distinct periods: 1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012, exploring three lines of inquiry: mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. A key innovation of the project is the use of network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references. \n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a major reorientation in cultural memory research, the development of analytic tools to capture cultural transmission of hope, and the opening up of a new area of social movement research. Ultimately, \"ReAct\" will provide critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity, shedding new light on the complex and evolving nature of protest and activism in Europe."
