        "Title: Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project that develops a unified Keynesian growth framework to study business cycles and growth. The project combines Keynesian aggregate demand fluctuations with endogenous growth theory on productivity, creating a novel model that accounts for heterogeneous firms and state-of-the-art quantitative endogenous growth features. The research will be divided into three parts: (I) developing the novel Keynesian growth model, (II) extending it to an open economy to examine monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth interactions, and (III) empirically testing the productivity growth response to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions.\n\nThe project will investigate productivity behavior during large recessions, such as the Great Recession, and explore stagnation due to pessimistic expectations. Case studies will focus on the Euro inception effects and empirical response estimation in the United States and a panel of advanced economies. The expected outcomes of this project will provide valuable insights into the interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth, and stabilization policies, ultimately informing more effective policy interventions to promote sustainable economic growth."
