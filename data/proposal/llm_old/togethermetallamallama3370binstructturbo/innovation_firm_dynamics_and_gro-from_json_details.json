        "Title: Innovation, Firm Dynamics, and Growth: Insights from French Firm-Level Data\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the intricacies of innovation, firm dynamics, and economic growth through the lens of the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth. By leveraging French firm-level data, our research aims to investigate the roles of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies in driving productivity growth, innovation, and trade. We will examine key research questions, including the measurement of total factor productivity growth, the relationship between innovation and trade, and the impact of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship. Additionally, we will analyze the effects of creative destruction on social mobility, health, and wellbeing. Our study will provide valuable insights into addressing pressing growth aspects, such as the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, and top income inequality. The ultimate goal of this project is to inform evidence-based growth policy design, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between innovation, growth, and social mobility. By confronting theory with data, our research will shed new light on the mechanisms and policies of innovation, ultimately informing more effective policies to promote sustainable economic growth."
