        "Title: What are the origins of empathy? A comparative developmental investigation\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking comparative study of empathy development in humans and bonobos. Using innovative techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, our longitudinal observations and experiments will investigate the evolutionary and developmental origins of empathy. We will conduct research in diverse contexts, including human infants in Vanuatu and Samoa, and bonobos in wild and semi-captive settings. Our study will focus on distributed-caregiving societal structures, challenging traditional perspectives on human uniqueness in empathy. \n\nOur research aims to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, and advance our understanding of empathy's origins. We hypothesize that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in their motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states. This interdisciplinary project integrates biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, with potential outcomes including a deeper understanding of human-unique sharing and cooperation. The findings of this study will significantly contribute to our knowledge of empathy's origins and have implications for various fields, from social psychology to conservation biology."
