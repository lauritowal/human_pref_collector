        "Title: The Evolutionary Landscape of Modern Human Origins in Africa (NGIPALAJEM)\n\nThis grant proposal, NGIPALAJEM, seeks to explore the evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa, focusing on the species Homo sapiens. The project aims to establish empirical benchmarks to answer fundamental questions about human evolution, particularly in the context of significant climatic changes that occurred 1.4 million years ago. The Early Mid-Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), which lasted for 1 million years, was characterized by greater climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, influencing the evolution of human populations and the large mammal community.\n\nFieldwork in Turkana will focus on adding to the hominin fossil record and increasing the large vertebrate fossil record, with a particular emphasis on the discovery of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. Inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses will be employed to investigate the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas. Using novel morphometric and analytical techniques, this project expects to provide new insights into human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape over the last million years, particularly during the Middle Pleistocene. The anticipated outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of human evolution and the dynamics of the African fauna during this critical period."
