        "Title: Temporal Structures of Gender Inequalities in Asian and Western Welfare Regimes\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comparative research project examining the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes. Building on Esping-Andersen's \"three worlds\" framework, our study will investigate how different welfare regimes influence gender roles, time use, and unpaid work in East Asian (China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan) and Western societies. We will employ a cross-national and historical comparative analysis, utilizing time diary data and household panel data to explore the impact of public policies, modern technology, and social inequality on the gender division of labor, care provision, and domestic labor.\n\nOur research will focus on the household, societal, and life course levels, analyzing how daily activities, life schedules, and leisure time contribute to gender inequalities. By examining the enjoyment and distribution of unpaid work, care provision, and domestic labor, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between welfare regimes, time use, and gender inequalities. The study's findings will inform public policies and contribute to the development of more equitable and sustainable welfare systems, ultimately promoting social equality and improving family outcomes in diverse cultural contexts."
