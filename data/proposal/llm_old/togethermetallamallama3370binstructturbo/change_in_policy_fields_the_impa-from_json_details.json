        "This grant proposal, \"Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010,\" aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies across 25 OECD countries over a 30-year period. The project objectives are to explain the patterns of change in morality policy fields and identify factors driving these changes. The study will focus on three subfields: life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances and behavior. Using a mixed-methods approach combining macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies, the project will analyze legislative output data to compare changes in morality policies over time and across countries. The qualitative case studies will be selected based on critical cases identified through the quantitative analysis. The expected outcomes of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex factors influencing morality policy changes and provide insights for policymakers and scholars alike."
