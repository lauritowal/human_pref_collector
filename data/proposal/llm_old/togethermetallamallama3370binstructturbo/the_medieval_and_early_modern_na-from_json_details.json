        "Title: The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project investigating the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods. Despite their crucial role in maritime expansion, these charts remain one of the least studied and understood components of this phenomenon. The current state of research in the History of Cartography is limited, with detailed technical studies still in their infancy.\n\nThis project aims to address key research questions regarding the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, their technical evolution over time, and their use at sea. An innovative methodology will be employed, combining analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and examination of manuscripts using special lighting. The objectives are to unveil hidden graphic content, characterize main geometric features, establish connections with navigational methods, and simulate chart construction numerically.\n\nBuilding on previous work that solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this proposed research will tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. The project's impact will be significant, contributing not only to the History of Cartography but also to intellectual history at large. By shedding new light on the birth, evolution, and use of medieval and early modern nautical charts, this research will advance our understanding of a pivotal aspect of human exploration and discovery."
