        "This grant proposal, \"Meeting Darwin's last challenge: toward a global tree of human languages and genes,\" aims to establish a correspondence between language families and classical genetic markers. Building on the theoretical impact of molecular biology on historical species and population classification, as advocated by Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994), this project addresses the weakness of current language classification methods. A new approach, based on grammatical evidence and advances in formal and typological linguistics (Longobardi and Guardiano, 2009), will utilize unprecedented standards of testability and replicability to measure linguistic distances between remote populations. By combining the expertise of linguists and biologists, significant populations will be jointly selected for language and gene sampling, leveraging powerful genetic tools and biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity, ultimately testing Darwin's prediction of an isomorphy between trees of languages and populations."
