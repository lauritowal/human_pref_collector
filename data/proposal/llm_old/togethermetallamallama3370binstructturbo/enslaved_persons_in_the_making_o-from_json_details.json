        "Title: Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE (SLaVEgents)\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the agency of enslaved persons in shaping ancient societies and cultures in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. The research team, comprising a principal investigator, senior researchers, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD candidates, will analyze the multiple identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals and their significant influence on historical changes. The project will cover a range of languages, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin. Expected research outputs include a digital prosopography, a monograph, collective volumes, articles, PhD dissertations, workshops, an international conference, and a website. By examining the role of enslaved persons in ancient societies, this project aims to provide new insights into the complex dynamics of slavery and its impact on the development of cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa. The SLaVEgents project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the ancient world and the experiences of enslaved individuals, shedding light on a crucial aspect of human history."
