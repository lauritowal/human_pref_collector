        "Title: Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the origins of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties, with a specific focus on the colonial conquest of Latin America. By analyzing the initial years of colonization, when Spanish conquerors lacked knowledge about the land, this project aims to shed light on the early institutions that shaped the development of state capacity and democratic systems. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, combining case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between colonial powers, institutional development, and long-term political outcomes.\n\nThe proposed project leverages unique historical documentation, including Capitulaciones and Archivo de Indias, to gather detailed information on the rules governing early institutions and the location of initial settlements at the subnational level. By examining the experiences of Spanish colonization in Latin America, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how early institutional arrangements influence the emergence of state capacity and democratic institutions. The findings of this project will have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of political development and the long-term consequences of colonial legacies."
