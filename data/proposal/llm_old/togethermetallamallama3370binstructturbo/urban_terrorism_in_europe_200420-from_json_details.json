        "Title: Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" seeks funding for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in four European countries: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Between 2004 and 2019, these nations experienced over ten devastating terrorist attacks, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Our project, UrbTerr, will employ a multifaceted approach, combining memory studies, cultural studies,! feminist theory, and anthropology to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining after attacks. \n\nThe primary objectives of this research include developing a new materialist approach to terrorism, assessing existing policies and security infrastructures, and utilizing performance art to create alternative forms of remembering and envisioning the future. The expected outputs of this project include a website featuring interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and public performances by the 'Center for Political Beauty.' By providing the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent urban terrorism in Europe, UrbTerr aims to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding these tragic events."
