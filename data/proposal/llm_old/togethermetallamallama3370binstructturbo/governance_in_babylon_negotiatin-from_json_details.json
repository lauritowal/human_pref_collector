        "Title: Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires (GoviB)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project, GoviB, which explores the dynamics of governance in ancient Babylon under the successive rule of the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian empires from the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC. The project focuses on local negotiations of imperial rule and the strategies employed by rulers to maintain stability or mitigate instability. Despite the challenges posed by incomplete historical data and ambivalent or conflicting interpretations, this study aims to advance our understanding of politics and authority in Babylon during this period.\n\nUtilizing a governance studies conceptual framework, the project will analyze Neo-Babylonian archival texts and archaeological materials from German excavations in Babylon, housed at the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin. The research goals include evaluating the impact of empires on cultural transformation and reassessing modern perceptions of oriental governance and regime stability. By investigating the complex interactions between imperial powers and local populations, GoviB will contribute to a nuanced understanding of ancient governance and its relevance to contemporary debates on authority, power, and cultural transformation."
