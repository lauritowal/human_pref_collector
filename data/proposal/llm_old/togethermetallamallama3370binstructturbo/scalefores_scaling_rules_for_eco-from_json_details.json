        "Title: SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping\n\nAbstract:\nThe SCALEFORES project proposes a novel methodological framework for mapping relationships between ecosystem services, addressing a critical challenge in reliably identifying these interactions. By examining scale-dependency and creating maps of trade-offs and win-wins, this project aims to enable multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. Focusing on Europe, a region with unparalleled data on ecosystem services, SCALEFORES will leverage existing data on land cover, soil type, and human population density. The project's objectives are to develop and validate a framework that accurately maps relationships between ecosystem services, ultimately increasing our ability to map their distributions. Validation will be conducted against existing ecosystem service maps in Europe. Anticipated outcomes include accurate maps of ecosystem service relationships and enhanced mapping capabilities, supporting informed decision-making for sustainable landscape management. By achieving these objectives, SCALEFORES will contribute significantly to the development of ecosystem service-based management practices, promoting more effective conservation and management of Europe's natural resources."
