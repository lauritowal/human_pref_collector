        "Title: Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a dynamic computer-based simulation system to model water and land-borne transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube in the Roman era. The project, STRADA, aims to reconstruct ancient land and water routes, experimentally determine the performance of various means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and introduce dynamic simulations into historical research. The simulation system will incorporate local topography, historical weather data, and factors such as fatigue, rests, and loading times to provide a realistic representation of transport times. By adopting a modular design approach, the system will be sustainable and adaptable for future extensions. The research will focus on the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscape, ultimately exploring the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire through a comprehensive understanding of its inland transport systems. The proposed project will combine technological innovations, experimental data, and historical research to shed new light on the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier."
