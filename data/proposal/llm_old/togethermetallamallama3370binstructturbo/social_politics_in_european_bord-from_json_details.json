        "Title: Social Politics in European Borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by exploring the social politics of European borderlands from the 1870s to the 1990s. Focusing on Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German border regions, this project will employ a comparative and transnational approach to examine the contributions of local actors, the co-construction of welfare, and the interactions between public and private actors. By analyzing local welfare structures and the dynamics of national and non-national identity and solidarity, this study aims to investigate inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, competition in social provision, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices. The anticipated outcomes of this project will not only provide a historical understanding of local actors' roles in shaping welfare but also inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address pressing social rights issues in Europe. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics that have shaped European welfare systems."
