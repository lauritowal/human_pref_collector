        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe,\" challenges traditional views of inequality in prehistoric Europe by exploring how social disparities manifested situationally rather than overtly. Through a critical examination of funerary practices and the role of ancestors, our project seeks to evaluate how inequality affected lives and understand the complex dynamics of power and identity during key periods of European prehistory. \n\nFocusing on Peninsular Italy, we will conduct empirical testing across three distinct periods: the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), the Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and the Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC). By applying innovative methodologies, including osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, we will analyze the remains of 200 individuals per period. Our research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between inequality, death, and the construction of ancestral identities, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced narrative of prehistoric European societies."
