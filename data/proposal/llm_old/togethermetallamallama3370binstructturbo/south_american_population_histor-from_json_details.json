        "Title: South American population history revisited: multidisciplinary perspectives on the Upper Amazon\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multidisciplinary project investigating the evolution of linguistic diversity in the Upper Amazon, western South America. The region's complex sociohistorical layers and rich linguistic diversity make it an ideal location to reconstruct geographical, socio-historical, and communicative layers of history. By comparing these layers, we aim to uncover past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade, and understand the interaction between ecology, human behavior, and cognition. The project will explore the significance of linguistic diversity in revealing past events and shedding light on the dynamics between human societies and their environments. Our research will provide valuable insights into the social dynamics that shaped linguistic diversity, using it as a window into our past. The expected findings will have significant implications for our understanding of population history, language contact, and the complex relationships between human behavior, ecology, and cognition."
