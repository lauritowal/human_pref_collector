        "Title: From Spatial Relationships to Temporal Correlations: New Vistas on Predictive Coding\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of gamma waves in cortical communication, synaptic plasticity, and predictive coding within the visual cortex. Gamma waves, oscillating at 30-80 Hz, are crucial for cortical communication and synaptic plasticity. Our project aims to explore their encoding functions and contribution to predictive coding, with a focus on their importance in neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\nWe will develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, utilizing deep-learning networks, multi-areal recordings, and MEG technology. Experiments will be conducted on both marmosets and humans, testing variables such as predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns. An optogenetics approach will be used to test the dependence of gamma waves on experience and perceptual learning. \n\nOur anticipated outcome is to provide evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration, challenging the standard view that gamma waves carry prediction errors. Instead, we hypothesize that gamma waves signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, with long-range gamma synchronization allowing different areas to predict each other's visual input. This project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of predictive coding and gamma waves, ultimately informing the development of new treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders."
