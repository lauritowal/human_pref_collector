        "Title: A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a unified program for assessing and applying cognitive models, addressing the proliferation of modeling ideas and techniques, idiosyncratic applications, and unclear state-of-the-art in cognitive modeling. Our goal is to establish a standardized framework using Bayesian inference foundations, assessing absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, and exploring efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. We will focus on popular cognitive models, including drift decision, stop-signal race, and reinforcement learning models. Enhancements will include constructing plausible parameter priors, developing diagnostic experiments, and assessing Bayes factors for hierarchical designs. The outcome will be a new standard for cognitive modeling, with techniques incorporated into JASP (jasp-stats.org), making the methodology accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners. This project aims to advance the field of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, providing a unified framework for the assessment and application of cognitive models."
