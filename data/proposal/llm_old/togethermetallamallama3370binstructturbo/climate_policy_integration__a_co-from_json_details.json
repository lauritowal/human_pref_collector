        "Title: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nAbstract:\nThe European Union is projected to miss its 2050 net-zero target due to poorly coordinated policy regimes. This project aims to develop a new theory explaining policy integration processes and address the lack of system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies. By employing a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, and comparative case studies, we will reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, and identify system-level solutions. Focusing on the EU and selected member states, we will analyze coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The expected outcomes will provide insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the debate beyond climate policy. With expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, our research team is well-positioned to tackle this complex issue and contribute to achieving the EU's climate goals."
