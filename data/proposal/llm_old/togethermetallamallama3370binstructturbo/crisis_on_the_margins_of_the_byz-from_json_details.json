        "Title: Crisis on the Margins of the Byzantine Empire: A Bio-Archaeological Project\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative, data-intensive approach to understanding the long-term sustainability of complex societies in resource-limited environments. Focusing on the 4th-7th century AD Byzantine early Christian urban centers in the Negev Desert, our project explores the contexts of collapse and resilience in an ancient society characterized by socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity. We aim to investigate the interplay between social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the impact of plague on these communities. \n\nOur multidisciplinary research methodology combines archaeology, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, geological analysis, and chronometric techniques to reconstruct the daily lives and environmental interactions of these ancient societies. The project's relevance lies in its potential to inform our understanding of societal vulnerability in marginal regions, a pressing concern in today's globalized world. By critically re-evaluating current knowledge and generating new data, this project will provide nuanced insights into the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development, ultimately contributing to more informed strategies for addressing contemporary challenges."
