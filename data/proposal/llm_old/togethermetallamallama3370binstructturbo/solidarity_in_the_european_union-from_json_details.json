        "This grant proposal, \"Solidarity in the European Union,\" aims to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity within the EU. The project will apply this model to key issues, including free movement of persons, refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement. By providing a comprehensive normative account of solidarity, this research seeks to address pressing challenges facing the EU, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and equitable union. The proposed project consists of two main components: developing the EUSOL1 model and applying it to central EU issues through EUSOL2."
