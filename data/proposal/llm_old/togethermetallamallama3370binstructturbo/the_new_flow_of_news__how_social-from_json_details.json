        "Title: The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of social network sites on news production, distribution, and consumption, as well as their effects on citizens' political behavior. As traditional news outlets decline and social network sites garner increasing attention, it is essential to explore the transformative process and reveal its implications. Our project aims to develop a new model of news flow, incorporating network logic and key actors such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees. We will employ innovative approaches, including big data analysis, small-N in-depth designs, and mixed-methods research, to study news organizations and user behavior. The two-year study will utilize surveys, web-based behavioral data, and laboratory observations to measure long-term political effects. This project will contribute to a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, and establish a new methodological standard for audience research. By exploring the intersection of social network sites, news, and political behavior, our research will provide valuable insights into the evolving media landscape and its implications for democracy."
