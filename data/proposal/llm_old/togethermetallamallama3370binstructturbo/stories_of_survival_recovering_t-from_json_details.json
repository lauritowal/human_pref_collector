        "Title: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative, transnational research project that explores the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. From the sixteenth century onwards, Eastern Christians from the Ottoman Empire migrated to various parts of the world, including Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. Our project aims to recover the stories of survival and experiences of these scattered communities, linking micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator and a team of multiple researchers, this project will analyze dozens of archives across three continents and in ten languages. Employing philology and source criticism as its methodological core, the project will challenge conventional historical narratives and provide new insights into Middle Eastern, European, and global history. The expected outcomes include print publications, workshops, and the development of a searchable database. By covering the period from 1500 to 1750, this project will shed light on the complex and interconnected histories of Eastern Christians, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of global history."
