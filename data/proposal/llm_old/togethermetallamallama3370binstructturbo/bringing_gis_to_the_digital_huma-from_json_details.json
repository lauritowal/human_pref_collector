        "Title: Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the field of Digital Humanities by integrating Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Corpus Linguistics to analyze unstructured texts in a spatial context. Led by a Principal Investigator with expertise in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), this project aims to develop innovative methodologies for spatially analyzing textual sources. Two case studies will be conducted: one exploring the English Lake District across different time periods, and another examining mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England and Wales in relation to socio-economic changes and political interventions. The project will engage with multiple disciplines, including HGIS, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History. Through short courses, expert meetings, and conferences, the project will disseminate its findings and foster a community of practice. By broadening our understanding of the humanities through the integration of textual sources and GIS, this project has the potential to make a major impact within the humanities and beyond, with applications ranging from ancient manuscripts to modern newspapers and e-resources."
