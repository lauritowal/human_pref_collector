        "Title: A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project aimed at developing a computational model to simulate the early language acquisition process in infants. The project focuses on infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months and utilizes speech databases in Japanese, French, and Dutch. By leveraging machine learning, automatic speech recognition, and neuroimaging techniques such as EEGs and fNIRS, our model will investigate the complex interactions between phonemes, words, and contextual rules that underlie language acquisition.\n\nThe project consists of four subprojects: (1) defining coding features for speech, (2) word segmentation in raw speech, (3) developing a predictive model of coarticulation in auditory space, and (4) integrating approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules. We will test our model using artificial languages and a longitudinal study, and compare its performance to state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers. This research will provide new insights into the mechanisms of early language acquisition and has the potential to inform the development of more effective language learning strategies and interventions for language disorders. The proposed project will contribute significantly to our understanding of human language development and has important implications for fields such as linguistics, psychology, and education."
