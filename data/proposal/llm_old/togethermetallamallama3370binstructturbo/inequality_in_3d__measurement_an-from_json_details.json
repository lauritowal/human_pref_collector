        "Title: Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between inequality and the macroeconomy. By measuring the economy at the household level across three key dimensions - consumption, income, and wealth - we aim to quantify the micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic theory. Our approach combines novel microdata, heterogeneous agent models, and disciplined empirical efforts to provide new insights into the implications of inequality for fiscal and monetary policy. The expected outcomes of this project include informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing lessons for policymakers on economic inequality, and contributing to the debate on this critical issue. Ultimately, this research will shed new light on the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, enabling more effective policy tools to address economic inequality and promote sustainable economic growth."
