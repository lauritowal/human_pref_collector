        "Title: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation into meritocratic narratives in literature, addressing significant research gaps in the field. The MERLIT project seeks to explore how writing practices shape meritocratic articulations and critiques, with a particular focus on the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. By examining historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, this research aims to provide a comprehensive literary history of meritocratic thought and advance our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing. The project will engage with criticisms of meritocracy, including its enmeshment with structures of domination and privilege. Through six interconnected work packages, MERLIT will draw on interdisciplinary fields such as literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation. Ultimately, this project aims to highlight literature's worldmaking role and offer a nuanced understanding of meritocratic narratives, contributing to a more global and inclusive discussion of these concepts."
