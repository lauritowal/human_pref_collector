        "Title: Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary project that investigates the intersection of life, resources, and the environment in Zarzis, Tunisia. The project focuses on understanding the end of lives in the Mediterranean context, with a specific emphasis on the interconnectedness of vital elements. Through the innovative application of forensics as the art of paying attention, our team will conduct ethnographic research, mapping unliveable life conditions in the region. \n\nCase studies will explore the impact of phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment on the local ecosystem and communities. By adopting a decolonial approach, shifting attention from Europe to Africa, this project breaks new ground in the development of forensics as a method for ethnographic study and the advancement of the vital elements concept. \n\nCollaborations with local artists, team site visits, and Method Lab work will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between resources, environments, and human lives. The proposed project, Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves, aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate web of life in the Mediterranean region, with a particular focus on the critical zone of Zarzis, Tunisia."
