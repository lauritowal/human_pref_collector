        "Title: Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project aimed at rewriting the history of Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity. By focusing on the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations, our project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the persistence of a high-level legal culture during this period. A team of three research groups, composed of scholars from diverse disciplines, will collaborate to achieve this goal.\n\nKey activities include the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, workshops with European scholars, and a final international conference on legal culture. The project's expected outputs include a collection of jurists' writings, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference. By exploring the relationship between the works of Roman jurists and the legislation of emperors, this project will shed new light on the complex patterns of thought that characterized Late Antiquity's legal culture. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of Roman law and its enduring influence on Western legal traditions."
