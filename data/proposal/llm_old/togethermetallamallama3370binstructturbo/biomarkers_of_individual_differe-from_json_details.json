        "Title: Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the relationship between physiological state, personality traits, and individual differences in human cortical visual processing. The project aims to understand how vision is affected by these factors, focusing on normally sighted individuals, including young children. By combining innovative methods such as pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics, we predict that behavioral and cortical properties will co-vary with personality traits. \n\nThe proposed research will utilize physiological interventions, including ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, to examine changes in perception and cortical processing. Expected outcomes include the development of new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolism. This project has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and encourage therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. By addressing the current knowledge gap in visual perception, this research aims to provide new insights into the complex relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception."
