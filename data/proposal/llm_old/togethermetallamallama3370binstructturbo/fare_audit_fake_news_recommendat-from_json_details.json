        "Title: FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - An Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results\n\nAbstract:\nThe FARE_AUDIT project proposes an innovative auditing system to investigate the influence of browsing history on search engine results and the dissemination of disinformation. The primary objectives are to understand how search engines direct users to disinformation, create a real-time disinformation identification system, and breach information bubbles by simulating diverse user profiles. The proposed system features an auditing tool for search engines, privacy-protecting web-crawlers, and does not require real user data. By developing this system, we anticipate increased public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread and equipping organizations with a disinformation detection and monitoring tool. The project also addresses the shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting, a significant technology shift in online tracking methods. Ultimately, FARE_AUDIT aims to contribute to democracy-promoting efforts by providing a robust solution to identify and mitigate disinformation in near real-time, addressing a critical gap in current efforts to combat the spread of disinformation."
