        "Title: Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking project that reexamines the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy through the lens of early Franciscan thought. Challenging the prevailing assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past work, this project aims to highlight their innovative contributions to the development of Western philosophy. By implementing a \"practice-led\" hermeneutic approach, the project will produce a comprehensive study of early Franciscan thought, identifying novel elements, including the use of Islamic sources, and drawing connections between early and late Franciscan schools. The expected outcome is a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought, showcasing the shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity. This project will advance knowledge in the field of scholasticism, providing a new understanding of how Franciscan ideas evolved into modern Western philosophy when removed from their original context. The proposed research has the potential to achieve a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy."
