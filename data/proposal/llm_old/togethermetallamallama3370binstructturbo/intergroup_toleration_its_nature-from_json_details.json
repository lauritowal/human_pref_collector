        "Title: Intergroup Tolation: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance the state of the art in social sciences by investigating the social psychology of intergroup toleration. The project seeks to address the pressing question of how to live harmoniously in increasingly diverse societies. To achieve this, we will examine the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the psychological processes that drive it, its limits, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. Our methodology will combine survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG to provide a comprehensive understanding of intergroup toleration. The expected outcome of this research is to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society. Given the scarcity of systematic empirical research on this topic, this project is both ground-breaking and timely, offering a unique opportunity to fill a significant knowledge gap and inform strategies for promoting social cohesion in diverse societies."
