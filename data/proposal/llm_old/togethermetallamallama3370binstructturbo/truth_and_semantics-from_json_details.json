        "Title: Truth and Semantics\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Truth and Semantics,\" seeks to develop a unified perspective on natural language semantics, integrating truth-conditional semantics and research on semantic paradoxes in the form of self-applicable truth theories. The project addresses two primary challenges: \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics.\" \n\nThe first objective, \"Truth in Semantics,\" aims to develop semantic accounts for complex fragments of natural language, focusing on key elements such as the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. The second objective, \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics,\" adopts a metasemantic perspective to investigate the role of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, providing a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between truth, semantics, and natural language. By exploring these fundamental questions, this research has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of language and its underlying semantic structures."
