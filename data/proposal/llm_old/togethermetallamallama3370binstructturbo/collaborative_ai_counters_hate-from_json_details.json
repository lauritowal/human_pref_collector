        "Title: Collaborative AI Counters Hate\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking project to tackle AI-assisted extreme speech moderation challenges. The \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" initiative seeks to develop an innovative, collaborative approach to address the limitations of current AI-powered moderation tools. Key challenges to be addressed include the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets, as well as the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural contextualization. \n\nThe proposed solution, based on the AI4Dignity project model, involves a global comparative framework, community-based classification approach, and collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries. The primary goals of this project are to improve AI-assisted speech moderation, develop an open-access toolkit, set procedural benchmarks, and create inclusive training datasets. \n\nBy operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle, this project aims to effectively counter online hate speech and disinformation, promoting a safer and more dignified online environment. The expected outcomes of this project will have a significant impact on the development of more effective and responsible AI-powered moderation tools."
