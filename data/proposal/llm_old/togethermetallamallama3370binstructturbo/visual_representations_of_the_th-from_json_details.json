        "Title: Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the third plague pandemic, which ravaged the world from 1855 to 1959, claiming approximately 12 million lives. The project will focus on the impact of photography as a technological influence on the visual documentation of the pandemic across various regions, including China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America.\n\nA team of researchers, led by a principal investigator and comprising three full-time postdoctoral researchers, will conduct a comprehensive analysis of visual representations, examining aspects such as the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death and burial practices, and the intersection of race, class, and discrimination. By exploring these themes, the project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how visual representations shaped public perception and response to the pandemic.\n\nThe proposed research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex relationships between technology, visual culture, and public health, with implications for contemporary global health challenges. The project's findings will be disseminated through academic publications, conferences, and public exhibitions, ensuring a broad impact and engagement with diverse audiences."
