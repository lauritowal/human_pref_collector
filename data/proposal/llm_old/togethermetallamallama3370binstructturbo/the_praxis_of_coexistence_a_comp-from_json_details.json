        "Title: The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research program that addresses the complex issue of ethno-religious coexistence. The project will employ a comparative and inductive approach to investigate how coexistence is practiced in diverse communities across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. The primary objectives are to understand spontaneous coexistence practices, inform policy through empirical study, and shed light on community expectations for coexistence. The research will focus on ordinary coexistence in the context of religious and ethnic diversity, exploring the resources communities use to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. Key research questions include how communities accommodate difference spontaneously and what resources they draw upon to maintain harmony. By examining existing practices and cultural contexts, this project aims to open theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence, ultimately contributing to more effective policies and a deeper understanding of community dynamics."
