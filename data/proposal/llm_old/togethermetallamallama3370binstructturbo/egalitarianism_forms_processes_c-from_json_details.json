        "Title: Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons\n\nThis grant proposal supports a comparative study on the cultural phenomena of egalitarianism, exploring its heterogeneous structures, processes, and values. The project combines library-based global comparative research with field ethnographic studies in Europe and beyond. The research aims to integrate library and field studies, understanding the complexities of egalitarian practices and processes, and developing a comparative method that is open to diverse conceptions and responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances. By examining the role of the state, religion, economic distribution, and scale, this project seeks to address the perennial questions surrounding egalitarianism. The study's decentering orientation and focus on heterogeneity will provide a nuanced understanding of egalitarianism as a cultural value, acknowledging its contradictions, limitations, and forces that shape its practices and processes. The proposed research will contribute to the development of a tailored comparative method, enhancing our understanding of the complexities of egalitarianism in various contexts."
