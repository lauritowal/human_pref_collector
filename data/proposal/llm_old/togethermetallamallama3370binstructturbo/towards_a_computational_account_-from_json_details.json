        "Title: Towards a Computational Account of Natural Sequential Behavior\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop computational models that capture the complexities of human sequential behavior in everyday tasks. The project seeks to understand and model how individuals perceive, process, and act upon information in the presence of uncertainty and variability. By integrating psychophysics, statistical decision theory, and optimal control, we will investigate how people make decisions and navigate tasks such as visuomotor control, navigation, and everyday activities like sandwich making. Our approach will combine behavioral experiments with advanced computational methods, including inverse reinforcement learning and active vision. The expected outcomes include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, and subjective costs and benefits. This project builds upon our previous work on visuomotor behavior and individual-based modeling, and will provide a comprehensive account of human sequential behavior under uncertainty. The results will have implications for fields such as robotics, human-computer interaction, and cognitive science."
