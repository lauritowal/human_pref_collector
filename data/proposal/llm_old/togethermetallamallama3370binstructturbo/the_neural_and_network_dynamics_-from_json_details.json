        "Title: The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the complex interplay between social influence, adolescent development, and behavior. During adolescence, individuals undergo significant changes in their social relationships, academic achievement, and prosocial behavior, while also being susceptible to risk-taking. The proposed project will explore how social media and viral risk-taking challenges amplify these factors. \n\nThe primary goals are to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models that capture the neural and network dynamics of social influence in adolescents. This will be achieved by treating adolescents as active information seekers, developing novel tasks, and utilizing computational models with functional magnetic imaging. The project will also conduct an experimental study in real peer social networks, incorporating social network analyses.\n\nThe research will address key questions such as when to search for social information and who to learn from. By combining innovative methods, this project expects to provide insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advance our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and inform the development of interventions to support healthy adolescent development. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex factors influencing adolescent behavior and inform strategies to promote positive outcomes."
