        "Title: Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the critical role of charitable food provision (CFP) in mitigating food insecurity among urban poor populations. The project will conduct a comparative analysis of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, with a focus on the cities of Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. Using a combination of event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, the research aims to chart the historical trajectory of CFP, examine its dynamics, and investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support. The project will also develop an innovative tool for real-time data collection and craft an overarching framework for CFP comparison. The anticipated impact of this research is to create new knowledge and offer comparative insights into food support and insecurity, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and equitable food system. By exploring the complexities of CFP in diverse institutional settings, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to address food insecurity and promote urban resilience."
