        "Title: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order, and the Birth of a Global Psyche\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a historical and interdisciplinary analysis of the origins and development of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry concepts in the aftermath of World War II. The project aims to investigate the universality of mental health notions, analyze the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, and provide a systematic account of the decolonization of psychiatry and mental health sciences. By exploring the intersection of culture, race, and individual psyche during the post-war and decolonization eras, this research seeks to define universal psychological mechanisms, facilitate an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and develop new cross-cultural models of the mind. The expected outcomes of this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between culture, psychiatry, and global health, ultimately informing more effective and culturally sensitive mental health practices."
