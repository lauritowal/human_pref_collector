        "Title: Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry (STARTDIALOG)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams, addressing the current lack of understanding of their logical properties and unappreciated heuristic potential. The project, STARTDIALOG, will employ a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and establish a comprehensive diagram database to clarify and solve current issues in the field. By investigating diagrams as objects of independent interest, this research aims to provide an accurate understanding of their methodological importance.\n\nThe proposed project has far-reaching implications, with applications in philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. A breakthrough in logical geometry is expected, with significant relevance for philosophical logicians and potential applications in various disciplines. The expected outcomes of STARTDIALOG include a deeper understanding of Aristotelian diagrams, resolution of current issues, and the establishment of a new framework for the study of logical geometry. This project has the potential to make a substantial impact on our understanding of logical properties and their applications, and we believe that it warrants funding to bring this innovative research to fruition."
