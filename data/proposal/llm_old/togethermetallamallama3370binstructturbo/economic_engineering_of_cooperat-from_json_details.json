        "Title: Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address cooperation problems in modern markets and societies through an economic engineering approach, as advocated by Alvin Roth. Cooperation is essential for the economy and society, and this project aims to develop innovative solutions to promote cooperation in various contexts. The proposal consists of three work packages: (1) designing electronic reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in the digital world, where current trust mechanisms are flawed; (2) developing mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, which can lead to collective wastefulness and threaten market liquidity and stability; and (3) creating market designs aligned with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights, to overcome distaste for certain kinds of transactions.\n\nUsing experimental methods and behavioral game theory, this project expects to achieve improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. The outcomes of this research will have significant implications for the economy and society, ultimately contributing to a more cooperative and stable market environment."
