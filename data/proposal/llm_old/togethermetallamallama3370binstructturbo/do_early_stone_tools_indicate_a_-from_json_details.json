        "Title: STONECULT - Uncovering the Origins of Human Culture through Early Stone Tools\n\nAbstract:\nThe emergence of culture is a pivotal moment in human evolution, enabling our species to colonize the planet. The STONECULT project seeks to address the pressing question of when forms of culture first arose in our lineage. By investigating early stone tools, we aim to determine whether these artifacts reflect cumulative culture, as seen in modern humans, or rather represent latent solutions, which may have relied on different social learning mechanisms. Our research will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, comparing early stone tools to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches. We propose two hypotheses: that early stone tools do not manifest cumulative culture, and that they are better explained by the latent solutions model. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of human culture evolution, informing fields such as anthropology, archaeology, and comparative psychology. If our findings confirm the latent solutions account, they will suggest that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, revolutionizing our understanding of human cultural development."
