        "This grant proposal, \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships,\" examines the lasting impact of authoritarian regimes on the development of norms in new democracies. Focusing on countries such as Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, this project investigates how ideological associations with past dictatorships influence voter and party political positions. Using survey experiments, the research aims to develop a new theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies. Key areas of inquiry include the decline of left-wing parties, the emergence of radical right parties, and the likelihood of right-wing protests. By exploring voters' avoidance of authoritarian ideologies, national identity, and party elite discourse, this project seeks to contribute to our understanding of post-transition party systems and the demand and supply sides of party competition."
