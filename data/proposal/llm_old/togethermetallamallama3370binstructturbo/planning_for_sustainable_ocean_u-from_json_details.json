        "Title: Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change (PLAnT)\n\nAbstract:\nThe PLAnT project aims to develop an integrated, sustainable marine spatial planning (MSP) framework for Antarctica, addressing the urgent need for effective management of ocean resources amidst rapid global environmental change. With no existing MSP in Antarctica, this project fills a critical gap by assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities, building future scenarios, and supporting area-based climate action. The objectives of PLAnT include providing dynamic solutions, conducting governance analyses, and fostering a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity. By incorporating the critical effects of climate change, this project will inspire nations to adopt sustainable ocean use practices, contributing to the global agenda for ocean sustainability. Despite the challenges posed by contextual idiosyncrasies, the potential global impact of PLAnT is substantial, making it a high-priority initiative for international cooperation and environmental stewardship."
