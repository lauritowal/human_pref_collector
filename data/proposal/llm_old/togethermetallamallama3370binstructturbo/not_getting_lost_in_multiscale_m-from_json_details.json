        "Title: Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions\n\nThis grant proposal, \"LostInZoom,\" aims to revolutionize the way users interact with multi-scale maps, particularly in crisis management contexts. Current multi-scale interactive maps often disorient users during zooming interactions, hindering effective decision-making. To address this, our project will identify multi-scale visual landmarks that serve as anchors, guiding users through zooming interactions. We will design novel cartographic generalization techniques and create intuitive zooming interactions focused on these landmarks. Through experimentation and design, we will establish new zooming paradigms, providing guidelines for map designers to create seamless exploratory experiences. By improving multi-scale map usability, this project will enhance the effectiveness of crisis management and other applications relying on interactive maps."
