        "This grant proposal, \"Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge,\" seeks funding for a comprehensive study exploring the foundational role of sociographic journalism in the development of social science. The project will analyze a diverse corpus of texts, including social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America. Using anthropological and historiographical approaches, the research will focus on representational techniques, connections to epistemic developments, and embeddedness in socio-spatial settings. The expected outcomes include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. By situating journalistic sketches against the backdrop of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and academic discipline institutionalization, this project aims to provide new insights into the formation of ethnographic and sociological knowledge during the nineteenth century."
