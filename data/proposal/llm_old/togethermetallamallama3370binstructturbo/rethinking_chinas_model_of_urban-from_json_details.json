        "Title: Rethinking China's Model of Urban Governance\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive investigation into China's urban governance model, tackling theoretical and policy challenges of world-historical significance. Through ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and collaboration with Chinese researchers and policymakers, we will examine urban governance at multiple scales, from neighborhoods to regions. Case studies in Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area will provide a nuanced understanding of China's coastal, central, and western regions.\n\nOur research is timely, coinciding with the UN-endorsed New Urban Agenda and ongoing trade tensions. By exploring recent national strategic projects, we will contribute to theory development on entrepreneurial urban governance and offer an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. The project will yield six workshops and a publication series, ultimately changing how we think about China and its governance by providing a theoretically grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism. Our findings will have significant implications for urban governance and policy-making, both in China and globally."
