        "Title: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop and promote active ageing by exploring its determinants, modifiers, and outcomes. Building on the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing, our project will create a novel scale assessing ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy in older adults. A cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85 will inform scale development, while a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants will test the feasibility and effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention. The intervention will utilize counselling, information technology, and volunteer support to promote active ageing. \n\nBy comparing our findings with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago, we will examine cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. Our state-of-the-art statistical methods will provide novel insights into the preconditions for active ageing, ultimately producing evidence for its promotion. The expected outcomes include a novel scale for active ageing, training opportunities for young scientists, and the development of new concepts and theory. This project will contribute significantly to the field of ageing research, informing strategies to support older adults in achieving active and healthy ageing."
