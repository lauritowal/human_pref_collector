        "Title: How Nature Affects Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Systems\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the intricate relationships between natural environments and human cooperation in managing common-pool resources. The project aims to establish how nature influences the preferences and incentives of economic agents, ultimately affecting the sustainability of renewable resources. We will explore three key mechanisms: (1) the role of tipping points and thresholds in encouraging cooperation, (2) the impact of resource abundance volatility on risk preferences and community-based management, and (3) the interaction between leadership and the natural environment in fostering cooperation.\n\nThe project will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining theoretical and statistical methods, and will be conducted on a continental scale, covering three continents. By bridging the fields of economics and sustainability science, we aim to identify the circumstances under which natural preconditions and social settings promote the sustainable use of renewable resources. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide insights into the complex dynamics of common-pool resource management, informing strategies for overcoming common-pool dilemmas and ensuring the long-term sustainability of vital resources."
