        "Title: Quantitative Models of Cities\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop innovative quantitative models to analyze economic divergence across and within countries, with a focus on the contrast between city and rural areas. Building on recent theoretical breakthroughs and the availability of high-resolution data, our project will combine quantitative models with detailed register data to shed new light on the dynamics of urban development. We will draw on key references, including Ahlfeldt et al. (2015) and Heblich et al. (2020), to inform our approach.\n\nOur project introduces several innovations, including the development of a dynamic model that allows for worker and firm heterogeneity. Using detailed Danish data, we will address policy-relevant questions related to urban transport infrastructure, the effect of height restrictions, and the impact of planning interventions on cities. By providing a deeper understanding of the complex interactions driving urban growth and decline, our research aims to inform evidence-based policy decisions that promote sustainable and equitable urban development. The proposed project will contribute to a better understanding of 20th-century urbanization trends and their ongoing implications, ultimately enhancing our ability to design and implement effective urban policies."
