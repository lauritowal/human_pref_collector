        "Title: Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health,\" aims to investigate the impact of pregnancy loss on women's mental health. The project, dubbed \"HealthyMom,\" will utilize multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry to study the effects of early miscarriage or still!birth on brain anatomy and function. By acquiring longitudinal data and conducting repeated assessments, we seek to understand the reversal of motherhood-associated changes in the brain and identify traces and determinants of afflicted mental health post-pregnancy loss.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include understanding female-specific brain dynamics, revealing neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability, and identifying targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The implications of this research are significant, with direct implications for women's health and indirect implications for the health of future offspring. By uncovering the relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors, we can inform the development of targeted interventions to support maternal mental health and mitigate the risk of mental health disorders."
