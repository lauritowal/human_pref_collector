        "Title: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the early representational preconditions and functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds, with a focus on inference and representation of mental states of others. Challenging standard theories that suggest representing others' beliefs is effortful and late developing, our novel theoretical approach posits that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in online cooperative social interactions. Recent evidence and our own research findings, which show that mechanisms for understanding mental states are present from as early as 7 months of age, motivate a paradigm change in our understanding of social mind functions. The proposed project seeks to explore the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, chart their developmental unfolding, and investigate the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. By investigating the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of human collaboration and social learning."
