        "Title: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nThis 5-year research project aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power, providing insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Building on the European Commission's 2007 reference, our objective is to incorporate richer firm behavior in models of international trade, focusing on how trade and industrial policies impact growth, particularly in less developed markets. We will investigate four key research questions: the impact of trade and competition policy on consumer benefits from globalization, the effect of domestic policies on small farmers' gains from trade, the influence of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages, and the consequences of banking globalization on firm growth in the real sector.\n\nBy integrating theoretical work with rich data from developing economies, this project will expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, providing a basis for informed policymaking. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between firm growth, market power, and policy interventions, ultimately contributing to more effective policy decisions that promote economic welfare in a globalized world."
