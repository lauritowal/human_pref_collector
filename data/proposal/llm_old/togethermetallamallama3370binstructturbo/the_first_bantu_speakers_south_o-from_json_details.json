        "Title: The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: Unraveling Human Migration, Language Spread, and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa\n\nAbstract:\nThis cross-disciplinary project aims to investigate the Bantu Expansion, a pivotal event in African history, by exploring the first Bantu-speaking village communities in Late Holocene Central Africa. Through an interuniversity collaboration, our research will integrate archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics to shed light on the timing, location, and archaeological signature of these early villagers. We will examine their interaction with hunter-gatherers, subsistence strategies, diet, and habitat, as well as the role of agriculture in their dispersal. Using lexical reconstruction and phylogenetic modeling, we will reconstruct the subsistence and land use practices of these early communities. Our holistic approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Central Africa, addressing key open questions and controversies surrounding the Bantu Expansion. Fieldwork in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola will be supplemented by archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data to inform our research. The project's findings will have significant implications for our understanding of African history and the complex relationships between human migration, language, and environment."
