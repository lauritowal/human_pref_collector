        "Title: Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address the complexities of allocating international responsibilities in cooperative actions. The SHARES project aims to rethink the allocation of responsibilities among multiple actors in international cooperation, ensuring the protection of the international rule of law and providing remedies for injured parties. The project will investigate the complications of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility. Through a conceptual and theoretical foundation, combined with an empirical approach using case-studies, SHARES will uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities. The project will focus on principles of collective, joint, or proportionate responsibility and develop new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility. Ultimately, SHARES aims to provide solutions for better matching international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility, promoting a more effective and accountable international legal framework."
