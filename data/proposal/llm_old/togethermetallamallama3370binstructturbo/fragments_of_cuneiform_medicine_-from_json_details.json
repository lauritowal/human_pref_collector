        "This grant proposal, \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity,\" presents the BabMed study, a groundbreaking investigation of ancient Babylonian medical science. As the first comprehensive study since the decipherment of cuneiform, it focuses on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine preserved in the Babylonian Talmud, written in Aramaic. The project challenges prevalent Eurocentric histories by comparing Babylonian medicine with neighboring systems, including Greek medicine. By relying on native taxonomies and overcoming barriers of script and language, this study aims to establish a new paradigm for knowledge transfer. The Babylonian Talmud, a unique text, reveals that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in local Aramaic, mirroring the scientific thinking of both Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia. The BabMed project promises to revolutionize our understanding of ancient medical science."
