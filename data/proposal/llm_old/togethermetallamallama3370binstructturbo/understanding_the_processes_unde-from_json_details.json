        "Title: Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop and apply a novel methodological framework to investigate the complex relationships between societal threats, such as climate change, politics, and vaccination, and underlying constructs like values, beliefs, and risk perception. Social scientists face significant challenges in measuring these constructs, including issues of observability, group differences, and measurement inequivalence. To address these challenges, we propose a mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework that incorporates clustering to identify subsets of groups with common processes and flexible measurement models to account for non-invariance. This approach will be applied to large-scale survey data to uncover the underlying processes driving societal threats. The proposed solution will be implemented in freely available software, enabling widespread adoption and advancing our understanding of the complex relationships between constructs and societal threats. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust and reliable method for investigating these relationships, informing evidence-based policies and interventions to mitigate societal threats."
