        "Title: The Mental Economy: Testing a Dynamic Trade-off between Internal Storage and External Sampling (HOMEOSTASIS Project)\n\nAbstract:\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project proposes a novel theoretical model of working memory, termed the \"internal mental economy,\" which posits that individuals maintain perceptual homeostasis by dynamically trading off internal storage against external sampling of the visual world. Challenging the dominant theory that working memory is limited solely by the absence of information, this project investigates the interaction between working memory and the visible world. We hypothesize that observers minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature, instead relying on external sampling to gather information. Using innovative paradigms that interact with the physically present environment, combined with electroencephalographic decoding, virtual reality technology, and machine learning applications, we will test this hypothesis. The project will also involve a patient study to validate the model and discover biometric signatures in eye movements. The proposed model has significant implications for diagnosing working memory disorders and understanding human interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments. By developing a more comprehensive understanding of working memory, the HOMEOSTASIS project aims to revolutionize our knowledge of human cognition and its applications in real-world environments."
