        "Title: Overcoming the Frontiers of Biomolecular Studies on Human History and Adaptation using Palaeoproteomics (BACKWARD)\n\nThis grant proposal, BACKWARD, seeks to revolutionize the field of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation through the development of cutting-edge palaeoproteomic workflows and advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions. The project aims to address the phylogeny of African and Asian extinct hominids, extend molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA limits, and reconstruct evolutionary history for species extinct millions of years ago. By applying palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing, the project will target phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. The expected outcomes have far-reaching applications, including identifying processes of human brain expansion, species and sex identification from fossil fragments, and potential repurposing in diagnostics, food, and pharmaceutical industries. A collaborative effort among participating institutions will drive this transformative project, anticipated to have a legacy impact comparable to that of ancient DNA over the past two decades."
