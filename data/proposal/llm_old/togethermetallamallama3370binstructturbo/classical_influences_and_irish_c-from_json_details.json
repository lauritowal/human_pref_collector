        "This grant proposal, \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture,\" explores the underexamined history of Ireland's cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome. Despite Ireland's exclusion from the Roman Empire, the country has a rich tradition of classical learning and earliest recorded literature. This project investigates why Ireland's unique cultural landscape is characterized by nine key themes, including language, land, and material culture. Through a multi-thematic and heuristic framework, our research facilitates dialogue between various fields, including classical reception studies, Irish and British history, and postcolonial studies. By examining the intersection of classical culture and Irish identity, this project sheds new light on contemporary preoccupations, such as politics, history, and social divisions. The expected impact of this research includes the opening of new investigation avenues, a deeper understanding of classical culture's influence on literary, social, and political discourse, and a broader historical perspective beyond the past 100 years."
