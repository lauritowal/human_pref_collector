        "Title: Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal seeks to validate a set of 10 provocative claims regarding long-term memory formation and maintenance in humans. The project will explore the parallels between human neural processes and potential artificial computing architectures, integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development. \n\nThe proposed approach involves a multi-faceted methodology, including the study of very long-term sensory memories through fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients. Additionally, computer simulations will utilize networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity to model memory mechanisms. The project will also involve the development of bio-inspired hardware that mimics brain memory systems, including memristor-like devices.\n\nBy investigating these claims and exploring the intersections between human and artificial memory systems, this project aims to significantly advance our understanding of long-term memory formation and maintenance, with potential implications for the development of more efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence systems. The highly interdisciplinary nature of this project will foster innovative collaborations and knowledge transfer across multiple fields, driving breakthroughs in our understanding of human and artificial memory mechanisms."
