        "Title: The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\n\nThis 5-year grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex relationship between social media and conflict in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa. The project aims to extend internet reach to remote, non-urban areas and provide affordable access to the world's poorest communities, particularly in regions with weak state presence and ongoing violent conflict. Our research will explore how social media alters the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, and how public authorities utilize social media to either perpetuate violence or promote peace. We will examine the impact of social media on individuals' experiences with violent conflict, including the spread of dangerous speech online and the tactics used by actors to shape the internet. By studying these dynamics in conflict-affected communities in Africa, this project will provide critical insights into the role of social media in peacebuilding and conflict escalation, ultimately informing strategies to promote peace and stability in these regions."
