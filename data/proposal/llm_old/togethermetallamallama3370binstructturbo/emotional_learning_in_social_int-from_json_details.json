        "Title: Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the mechanisms of emotional learning in social interactions, with a focus on aversive learning about others, from others, and during interaction. The project aims to identify key factors, including stimulus-bound characteristics (e.g., ethnic group belonging, emotional expressiveness) and conceptual factors (e.g., moral and social status, empathy), that influence social-emotional learning. Using a combination of experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, and cognitive neuroscience methods, we will build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. The predicted networks involved include affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed systems. This study has the potential to provide insights into group conflicts, norm compliance, social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy, ultimately advancing our understanding of social learning and its role in shaping behavioral norms. The proposed research will contribute to the development of a social-cognitive network for social learning, shedding light on the complex interactions between emotional learning, social cognition, and behavior."
