        "Title: Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society: Exploring Human-Environment Interaction in the Ancient Near East\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the CLaSS project, a comprehensive investigation of human-environment interaction in the Ancient Near East's Fertile Crescent region, spanning 8000-2000 years before present. The project will employ a hybrid research approach, integrating archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data to examine the complex relationships between climate, landscape, and societal development. Utilizing General Circulation Models and cutting-edge techniques in archaeological data science and big data analysis, the project will focus on population densities, distribution, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies. The primary research goal is to identify factors contributing to the differential persistence of societies under changing climates. By exploring the resilience and sustainability of ancient societies in the face of abrupt and long-term climate changes, the CLaSS project aims to provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of human-environment interaction, ultimately informing strategies for building sustainable and resilient societies in the present and future."
