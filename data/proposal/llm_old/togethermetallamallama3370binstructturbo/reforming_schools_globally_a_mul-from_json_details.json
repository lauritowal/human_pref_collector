        "Title: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project investigating the global dissemination of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies. Despite widespread adoption, research on SAWA policies has yielded inconclusive and mixed findings. The REFORMED project addresses these knowledge gaps by analyzing the inception, operationalization, and effects of SAWA policies across diverse countries, administrative traditions, and levels of development. In collaboration with international organizations like the OECD, this study will examine the role of global reform pressures, policy convergence, and contextual circumstances in shaping SAWA policies. Using a robust, multi-scalar methodological strategy combining quantitative and qualitative methods, the project will investigate the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity at the school level. By exploring the complex interplay between institutional frameworks, policy enactment processes, and actors involved, including international bureaucrats and teachers, the REFORMED project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of SAWA policies and their implications for education globally."
