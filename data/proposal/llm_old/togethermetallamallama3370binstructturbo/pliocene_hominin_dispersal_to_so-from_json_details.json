        "Title: Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\n\nThis project investigates the dispersal of Pliocene hominins to southern Africa, leveraging a multidisciplinary approach that integrates paleoecological, anatomical, and genetic data. We aim to understand how early hominins adapted to and thrived in different environments, focusing on the dynamic interplay between geomorphological changes, palaeoecological shifts, and hominin evolution. Our research will assess the impact of climatic fluctuations, tectonic changes, and hydrographic modifications on hominin dispersal and speciation. We propose three key hypotheses: (1) East African hominin ranges expanded and contracted with wet and dry phases, leading to reproductive isolation of southernmost populations; (2) Northern Hemisphere Glaciation influenced dispersal corridors and facilitated intermittent hybridization between East African and southern African hominins; and (3) tectonic and hydrographic changes after 1.5Ma led to endemism in southern African hominins, resulting in the exploitation of distinct ecological niches. By exploring these hypotheses, this project will shed light on the complex processes that shaped the evolutionary history of hominins in southern Africa."
