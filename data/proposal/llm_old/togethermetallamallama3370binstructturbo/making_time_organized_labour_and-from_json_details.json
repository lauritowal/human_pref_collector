        "Title: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of organized labour in promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe, with a focus on social policies that support sustainable work through family and self-care time. The project will examine the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections, with a particular emphasis on the predominance of women in caregiving and union membership. Using a mixed-method research design, the study will combine quantitative analysis of rich democracies from 1965 onwards with qualitative analysis of case studies in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. The research will investigate the influence mechanisms of trade unions in shaping care leave policies, including child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. By advancing comparative labour studies and developing theories of union-policy relationships, this project aims to contribute to the development of sustainable work policies and promote organized labour's role as a partner in this process. The expected outcome is a comprehensive understanding of organized labour's impact on care leave provisions and the development of a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure to inform future policy innovations."
