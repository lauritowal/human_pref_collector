        "Title: An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"SynSig,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its impact on mental health. Challenging the conventional assumption that higher synchrony always equals better outcomes, SynSig aims to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures and their role in shaping mental health. The project objectives include identifying unique synchrony patterns, exploring tailored corrections, and analyzing the transformation of relationships into curative ones through synchrony adjustments. \n\nUsing multimodal markers and a novel feedback system, this study will examine individuals in dyadic interactions with humans and virtual humans. The expected outcomes include evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the complex nature of synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. By facilitating individual-tailored changes in synchrony, SynSig has the potential to pave the way for more effective, personalized interventions in mental health treatment."
