        "Title: Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Recent advances in brain signal analysis will be leveraged to address conceptual and technical challenges in studying social information representation. Our approach involves studying social interaction under naturalistic settings and measuring temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals using novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition. We hypothesize that selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, and that similarities in cognitive task sets and intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow. This project has the potential to improve our understanding of brain dynamics of social interaction, contributing to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. By adopting a naturalistic neuroscience approach, we aim to overcome the limitations of simplistic and impoverished social stimuli used in traditional experiments, ultimately advancing our knowledge of the complex social world."
