        "Title: The Real Estate/Financial Complex\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the interconnected relationships between real estate, finance, and state involvement, addressing a significant research gap in understanding the complex dynamics between these sectors. The project, commencing in 2007, will adopt an internationally comparative approach, examining quantitative and qualitative shifts in the real estate/financial complex. \n\nA postdoctoral researcher will lead the comparative research, while three PhD students will conduct national mappings of the complex and local/urban case studies across two countries each. The Principal Investigator will focus on the qualitative shift towards real estate and finance, the role of the state, and the global dimensions of the complex, ultimately aiming to conceptualize the real estate/financial complex as a novel metaphor.\n\nBy exploring the intricate connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement across different scales, this project will provide new insights into the functioning of the real estate/financial complex, shedding light on the under-researched interactions between these sectors. The proposed research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships driving economic and urban development, ultimately informing policy and practice in these fields."
