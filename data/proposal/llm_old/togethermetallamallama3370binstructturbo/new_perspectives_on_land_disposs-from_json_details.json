        "Title: New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project investigating the complex relationships between land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel, with a focus on Mali. The project aims to explore how land dispossession affects farmers and pastoralists, and whether it leads to increased migration or violent resistance. Our hypothesis suggests that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, which may be linked to the rise of 'jihadist' groups. Using a mixed-methods approach and drawing on theoretical frameworks from political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, we will investigate the link between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration. The expected outcomes include novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and ideas for policy formulation. This project will provide critical knowledge to inform policy and interventions addressing the root causes of violent conflict and migration in the West African Sahel."
