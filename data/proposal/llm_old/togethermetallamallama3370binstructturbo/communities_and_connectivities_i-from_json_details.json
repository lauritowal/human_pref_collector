        "Title: Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a pioneering project in Iron Age European Archaeology, focusing on Britain within the wider European context from 800 BC to AD 100. By integrating ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological methods, our research aims to revolutionize the understanding of Iron Age communities. The primary objectives include mapping genetic clusters, addressing population movement, exploring inter-regional connectivity, and examining social dynamics. \n\nOur team of experts will analyze 1000 individuals from the UK and 250 from Europe, conducting the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. This project is expected to yield a new vision of Iron Age communities, shedding light on household compositions, familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities. As a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond, the outcomes of this research will have a significant broader impact, advancing our knowledge of human history and migration patterns."
