        "Title: It Takes a Village: An Interdisciplinary Community Neuroscience Approach to Characterize Multigenerational Interactions\n\nThis grant proposal, \"It Takes a Village,\" seeks to understand multigenerational communication within and beyond family contexts through an innovative, interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach. By combining laboratory research and real-world experimentation, our project, InterCom, aims to investigate how age-related differences in brain rhythms, speech processing, and predictive abilities impact conversational flow across generations. We will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups during real-world storytelling events, co-designed with community partners, and use this data to inform subsequent laboratory studies. Our objectives are to combine laboratory and real-world data collection, develop reciprocal stimuli and analysis methods, and generate insights and tools to improve communication between and across generations. This project innovates by testing a novel \"community neuroscience\" approach, leveraging the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control. By exploring intergenerational interactions, we aim to enhance our understanding of multigenerational communication and develop effective strategies to improve it."
