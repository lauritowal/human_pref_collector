        "Title: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development and testing of ReSeed, a blockchain-based platform designed to promote agrobiodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture. ReSeed aims to incentivize the cultivation and conservation of farmers' indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK) by providing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable system for tracking their flow. The platform will facilitate equitable and traceable transfers of ISK, promoting honest reporting of downstream research and innovation. By integrating with international regulatory frameworks and incorporating ethics guidelines, ReSeed will bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers' communities. With 12 years of previous research laying the groundwork, this project will contribute to global food security and sustainable agriculture, while acknowledging and adding value to farmers' ISK. The expected outcomes include in situ conservation, research and innovation with agrobiodiversity, and value addition to farmers' ISK, ultimately supporting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals."
