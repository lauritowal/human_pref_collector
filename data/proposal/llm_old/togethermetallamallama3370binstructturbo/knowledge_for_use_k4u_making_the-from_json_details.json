        "Title: Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nThis Horizon 2020 grant proposal, \"Knowledge For Use [K4U],\" seeks to revolutionize the application of social science in policy-making by developing a novel approach that prioritizes the practical use of knowledge. Currently, the emphasis on knowledge production overshadows the importance of knowledge utilization, hindering the effectiveness of social policies. K4U addresses this issue by focusing on the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation, and examining the role of values in the science-society interface.\n\nGuided by a Popperian philosophical approach, this project aims to provide policymakers with a practical understanding of policy design and deliberation. The objectives of K4U include developing a balanced framework that considers effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. By launching the field of philosophy of social technology, K4U will contribute to the development of \"philosophy for practice,\" offering intelligible and practical insights for policymakers to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies. Ultimately, K4U seeks to bridge the gap between social science research and policy implementation, enabling the creation of better-informed, more effective social policies."
