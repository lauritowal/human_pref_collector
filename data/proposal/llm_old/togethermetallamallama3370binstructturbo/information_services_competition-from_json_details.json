        "Title: Information Services: Competition and Externalities\n\nThis grant proposal aims to foster knowledge of the economics of information services, with a focus on strategic interactions, production and exchange of information services, and externalities. The project explores the role of externalities, including one-sided and two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and complements of information services and physical infrastructures, at both content and physical infrastructure levels. \n\nThe proposed research is divided into four parts: (1) background theory, covering two-sided markets and network dynamics; (2) the virtual layer, investigating recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs using empirical methods and proprietary e-commerce data; (3) the physical layer, examining pricing, investment, and net-neutrality; and (4) competition policy, focusing on two-sided markets. \n\nBy developing relevant theory, conducting empirical investigations, and creating original dynamic investment models, this project will provide valuable tools for competition policy makers and advance our understanding of the complex economics of information services. The expected outcomes will contribute to informed decision-making and effective regulation in the information services sector."
