        "Title: Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships of Transgender People\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on the psychosocial functioning and social relationships of transgender people. With a focus on transgender health, this project will utilize a biopsychosocial model and employ a variety of novel research methods across four work packages. The study seeks to isolate causal pathways linking hormone therapy to psychosocial outcomes, empower transgender individuals to share their experiences, and inform policy and practice for gender identity services. Given the high rates of social disruption and suicide risk among transgender people, this research is crucial for improving psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes. By positioning itself at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of transgender individuals and contribute meaningfully to the field of transgender health."
