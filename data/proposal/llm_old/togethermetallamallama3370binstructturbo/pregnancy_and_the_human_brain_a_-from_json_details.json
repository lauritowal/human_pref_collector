        "Title: Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the profound impact of pregnancy on the human brain, revealing a period of remarkable neuroplasticity. Our project aims to comprehensively map changes in brain anatomy and function across pregnancy and the postpartum period, identifying key factors driving these changes. We will focus on the implications of pregnancy-related neuroplasticity for maternal caregiving, mental health disorders, and memory issues. \n\nUsing a prospective cohort study design, we will track women from before conception through the postpartum period, leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging, psychopedagogic measures, and biomedical measures. Our study has the potential to establish a foundation for the emerging field of human neuroscience and provide groundbreaking insights into the neurobiological journey to motherhood. The expected outcomes of this project will significantly advance our understanding of the complex interplay between pregnancy, brain development, and maternal health, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to support women's health and well-being during this critical life period."
