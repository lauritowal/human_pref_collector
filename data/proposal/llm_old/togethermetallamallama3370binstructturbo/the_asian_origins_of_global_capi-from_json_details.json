        "Title: The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\n\nThis 5-year grant proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the origins of modern industrial capitalism by investigating the pivotal role of European factories in Asian ports during the 16th to 18th centuries. Focusing on the interactive dynamics between European East India companies and local merchants, this project aims to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, and recast the narrative of global economic change and capitalism. By integrating large archival repositories and collaborating with global partners, we will examine the economic activities in imperial trading centers and the factors that contributed to the emergence of global trade. Our research will be guided by key concepts from the New History of Capitalism, including the spatial theory of capitalist development and the decolonization of the history of capitalism. Ultimately, this project will provide a groundbreaking new perspective on the origins of global capitalism, highlighting the significance of Asian ports and the agency of local merchants in shaping the course of economic history."
