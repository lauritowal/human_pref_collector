        "This grant proposal, \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time,\" seeks to investigate the dynamics of power delegation to international organizations (IOs) and their subsequent empowerment. The project will adopt a comparative and longitudinal approach, analyzing IOs such as the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO between 1986 and 2010. By integrating insights from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, this research aims to develop a novel model of power delegation that accounts for temporal dynamics, principal cohesion, and institutional design. Through qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials, this study will provide new insights into the consequences of power delegation and contribute to the advancement of theoretical and empirical International Relations research. The ultimate objective is to enhance our understanding of how IOs acquire and exercise authority over time, shedding light on the complex relationships between states and international institutions."
