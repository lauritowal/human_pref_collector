        "Title: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an empirical investigation into the complex relationships between personal experiences, information environments, and aggregate economic shocks that influence political decisions. The project consists of three interconnected parts, each examining a distinct aspect of populism and extremism. The first part analyzes the impact of personal employment histories and information environments on voting behavior, using a large database of resumes and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. The second part explores the influence of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas, leveraging archival records and contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, and voting. The third part investigates the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, utilizing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and historical data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda. By examining the heterogeneity of responses to economic shocks, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the rise of populism and extremism, informing strategies for mitigating their harmful effects."
