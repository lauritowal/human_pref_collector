        "Title: Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time. The project, \"Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity,\" will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes to analyze the universality of patterns of kinship change. The research will consist of three components: VARIKIN-Evolution, focusing on kinship terminologies and family norms change through comparative phylogenetic modeling of eight language families; VARIKIN-Usage, examining the usage of kinship language through corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews; and VARIKIN-Development, studying children's acquisition and understanding of kinship in small-scale, non-Western communities. The objectives of this project are to analyze patterns of kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, link individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterize cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. By exploring the complex relationships between language, cognition, and social norms, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of kinship diversity and its evolution across cultures."
