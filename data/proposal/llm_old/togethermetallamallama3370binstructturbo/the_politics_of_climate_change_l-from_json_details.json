        "Title: The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD)\n\nAbstract:\nThe CCLAD project proposes an interdisciplinary investigation into the emergence and contestation of justice norms in the context of climate change loss and damage under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Despite the urgent need to address climate change consequences, a lack of consensus on loss and damage policy persists. This research will focus on key policy areas, including disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration. Through a theoretical and ethnographic methodology, CCLAD will examine the micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative domestic policy practices at international and national levels. The project aims to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, influence, contestation, or reversal, and to develop a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. By contributing to political ethnography and developing practice-tracing methods, CCLAD will provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of climate change governance, ultimately informing more effective policy responses to address the pressing issue of loss and damage."
