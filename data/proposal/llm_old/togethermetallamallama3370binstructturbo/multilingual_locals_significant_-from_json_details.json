        "Title: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking project that challenges the dominant perception of world literature as primarily English-language novels circulating globally. Our research focuses on multilingual locals and significant geographies, exploring how literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions shape the literary landscape in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia. By adopting a multilingual and located approach, we critique the monolingual straitjacket and modern literary histories that partition diverse cultural expressions. Our study examines local transculturations, debates on world literature, and forms of multilingualism across three key periods: imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. Through collaborative research with partners in Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France, we aim to develop a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues that promote a more inclusive understanding of world literature. Ultimately, our project seeks to redefine the boundaries of world literature, recognizing the multiplicity of choices and trajectories that shape literary production and circulation."
