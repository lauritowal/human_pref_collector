        "Title: The Silence of States in International Law\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking study exploring the concept of State silence in international law. The project aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of State silences, analyzing their legal effects and critically evaluating the need for a change in the law. By investigating whether State silence can bind them, the role of inaction in their responsibility, and its impact on international dispute settlement, this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of international law.\n\nThe study will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining analysis of State practice in six official UN languages, international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical analysis of reasoning from government officials and international judges. The research will focus on the binding nature of State silence, State inaction and responsibility, and State inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings, engaging with key stakeholders including States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals. The expected outcomes of this project will inform the development of international law and shape the behavior of States, international courts, and other stakeholders in the global community."
