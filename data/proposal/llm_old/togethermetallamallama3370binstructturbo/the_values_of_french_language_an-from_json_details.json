        "Title: The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to reevaluate the significance of the French language in Europe during the Middle Ages (1100-1450) as a supralocal, transnational language. The project aims to explore the relationship between language and identity in historical Europe, with a focus on the demarcation of cognate languages from one another. By examining the textual tradition of 'L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César', this research will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology.\n\nThe project will bring together scholars from European countries and North America, fostering collaboration between different scholarly traditions. Through empirical research and speculative reflection, this study will investigate the role of French in shaping linguistic identity in Europe during the Middle Ages, a period marked by multilingualism and the use of non-local languages such as Latin and French. Ultimately, this project aims to interrogate the French language's contribution to the emergence of a European identity during this period, providing new insights into the complex dynamics of language, culture, and identity in medieval Europe."
