        "Title: The Diseases of Modern Life: Nineteenth-Century Perspectives\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary project exploring the concept of modernity and its associated diseases in the nineteenth century. Using Benjamin Ward Richardson's seminal work, \"Diseases of Modern Life\" (1876), as a framework, our research will delve into the intersections of literature, science, and medicine to understand the physiological, psychological, and social health implications of modern life. Key focus areas include diseases caused by worry and mental strain, lifestyle diseases, environmental pollution, and profession-specific ailments.\n\nThrough a holistic and integrative approach, our project aims to track the circulation of ideas across disciplines, examining connections between health and disease in the context of modernity. By adopting a cross-disciplinary methodology, we expect to break new ground in scholarship, challenging traditional compartmentalizations of psychiatric, environmental, and literary history. Our research will provide new insights into the problems of modernity, offering innovative ways to contextualize and understand the complexities of modern life. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the enduring legacy of nineteenth-century perspectives on modernity and its associated diseases."
