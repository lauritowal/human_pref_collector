        "Title: Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project that explores the complex dynamics of foraging in the context of the post-2008 financial crisis and the escalating climate crisis. Despite its growing global relevance, foraging remains a poorly understood phenomenon, with patchy attention from mainstream academia. Our project aims to develop a political ecology of foraging, examining its emergence as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy in the Anthropocene era.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis of diverse foraging practices, including yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, and artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, our international research team will investigate the intersections of environmental degradation, economic instability, and human resilience. Based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, our team of five researchers will produce a range of outputs, including monographs, edited collections, PhD theses, peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition.\n\nBy shedding light on the complexities of foraging, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the ways in which humans interact with and shape their environments, and how these interactions are mediated by economic and political forces. Our research will provide critical insights into the possibilities and challenges of foraging as a means of subsistence and resistance in a world characterized by increasing environmental uncertainty and economic inequality."
