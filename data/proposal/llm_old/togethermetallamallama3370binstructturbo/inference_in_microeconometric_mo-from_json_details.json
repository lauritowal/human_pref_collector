        "Title: Inference in Microeconometric Models\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop innovative inference methods for microeconometric models, particularly those with unobserved heterogeneity, by leveraging longitudinal data. The project consists of three interconnected blocks, each addressing a distinct aspect of microeconometric modeling. The first block focuses on enhancing inference in nonlinear models, leading to improved statistical hypothesis tests. The second block concentrates on estimating models for network data, providing formal results by treating network data as panel data. The third block explores non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models, accounting for unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables.\n\nThe proposed methods have significant applications in understanding labor force participation and the behavior of firms and countries in international trade. Theoretical and simulation-based assessments will be used to evaluate the performance of the developed methods. By accounting for unobserved differences between economic agents, this project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of economic outcomes, such as schooling decisions, wages, and employment durations. The expected outcomes of this project will contribute to the advancement of microeconometric modeling and have the potential to inform policy decisions in various fields."
