        "Title: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History\n\nThis grant proposal, \"NUCLEARWATERS,\" presents a novel approach to understanding the history of nuclear energy by reframing it as a history of water. By recognizing nuclear energy as a hydraulic technology, this project challenges conventional narratives and seeks to resolve key riddles in the field. The investigation will explore historical water-manipulating technologies and contrasting conceptions of risk in wet and dry environments, set against the backdrop of centuries of hydraulic engineering and civilizations.\n\nThe project is divided into six work packages, each focusing on a distinct theme, including the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, and regional case studies such as the Rhine Valley and Japan's atomic coastscapes. By adopting a water-centred perspective, this research aims to revise our understanding of nuclear energy history and contribute to the fields of history of technology, environmental history, and public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. The proposed project has significant implications for our comprehension of the complex relationships between technology, environment, and society, and is poised to inform and influence ongoing discussions about nuclear energy's role in our future."
