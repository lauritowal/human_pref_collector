        "Title: Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance\n\nThis multi-sited ethnography explores the organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI recommendations in national health governance. Focusing on big data and AI-informed decision-making, the project addresses critical research gaps in the socio-cultural context, organizational collaboration with AI, and empirical evidence of human intervention with AI systems. By analyzing moments of human intervention with AI in six national settings, this study aims to develop a theory on organizational factors that facilitate ethical AI adoption. Using innovative anthropological methods, including future-scenarioing, the project will connect anthropological insights with AI development and partner with health decision-makers and policy institutions. The expected impact of this research is significant, with potential to inform national health policies and improve individual human lives. By shedding light on the complex interactions between humans and AI in national health governance, this project will contribute to the development of more effective, ethical, and responsible AI systems."
