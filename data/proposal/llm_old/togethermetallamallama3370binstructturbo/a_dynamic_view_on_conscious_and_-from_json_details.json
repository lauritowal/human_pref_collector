        "Title: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. By employing behavioral and brain imaging methods, our project will explore three key tracks: unconscious perception, conscious perception, and the maturation of consciousness. Track 1 will utilize Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and stimuli, while Track 2 will apply a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents. Track 3 will focus on pre-verbal infants, using psychophysical measures and high-density EEG to examine the development of consciousness through brain maturation. \n\nWe expect our research to have significant impacts, including providing evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, specifying the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and offering new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. By elucidating the dynamics between conscious and unconscious processes, our project aims to substantially advance our understanding of the human mind and its underlying mechanisms."
