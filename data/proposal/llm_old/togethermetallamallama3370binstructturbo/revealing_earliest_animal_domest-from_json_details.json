        "Title: Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a Neolithic archaeological research project focusing on the early evidences of sheep and goat management in the Fertile Crescent. By employing biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, our study aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying animal domestication, including control of reproductive cycles, changes to feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. The project will target key regions in the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent, analyzing faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to unravel existing paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identify how human societies changed the animals, and discover early caprine management practices. Ultimately, this research aims to establish when and where animal domestication processes began, providing new insights into the complex relationships between humans and animals in the Neolithic period. By exploring the earliest signs of animal domestication, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the development of human societies and the emergence of complex agricultural systems in the Fertile Crescent."
