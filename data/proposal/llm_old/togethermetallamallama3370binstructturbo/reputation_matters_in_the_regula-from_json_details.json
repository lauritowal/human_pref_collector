        "Title: Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability (RICA)\n\nThis grant proposal, RICA, challenges conventional assumptions about the regulatory state by re-examining the interplay between regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability. The project addresses key challenges, including the rise of non-majoritarianism and the devaluation of the political process, to develop new theoretical frameworks. Through two modules, RICA will investigate the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, and explore how reputation shapes accountability behavior. By drawing on insights from political science literature on reputation, this project aims to reconceptualize regulatory state assumptions and rethink normative and institutional design principles. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between autonomy, accountability, and credibility, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective and legitimate regulatory institutions."
