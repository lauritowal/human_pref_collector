        "This grant proposal, \"Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination,\" seeks to develop a pioneering ecological model for understanding the complex relationships between violence, cultural representation, and the natural world. The project aims to document and analyze how cultural expressions represent environmental violence, and map the intersections between ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide. By integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, this research will explore how representations of ecoviolence evoke emotions and critical self-reflection, and examine the role of guilt, responsibility, and cultural implication in environmental crises. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for pedagogical engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence. Ultimately, this project will reorient cultural memory research and ecocriticism to consider more-than-human perspectives, providing a novel framework for thinking about violence and memory in the Anthropocene era."
