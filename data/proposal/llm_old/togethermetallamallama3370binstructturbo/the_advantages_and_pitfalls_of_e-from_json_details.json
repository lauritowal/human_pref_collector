        "Title: The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. Through an empirical approach combining lab and field experiments, our project aims to understand the mechanisms underlying user engagement and its elicitation, determine its direct value for businesses, and assess its broader societal implications. Preliminary results suggest that calls to action have significant effects on conversion rates and information revelation. In collaboration with a leading website-development service provider operating under a freemium business model, this project will characterize the effects of calls to action across multiple product domains and isolate the underlying mechanisms driving these effects. The anticipated impact of this research includes advancing our economic and societal understanding of social computing, ultimately informing strategies for effective and responsible online user engagement. By exploring the advantages and pitfalls of elicited online user engagement, this project will contribute to the development of more effective and sustainable online interactions."
