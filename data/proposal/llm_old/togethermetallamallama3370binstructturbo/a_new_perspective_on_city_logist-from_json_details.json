        "Title: A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\nThis grant proposal aims to revolutionize city logistics by developing a novel framework that prioritizes public value. The project seeks to create a measurement system for city logistics planning and management, integrating multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. The objectives include developing a public value measurement system, designing Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure, and establishing operating procedures. \n\nThe proposed methodology involves network optimization, introduction of logistics markets, and learning-based optimization. The expected outcomes include a new theory of city logistics, efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and maximization of public value. The project's implications are far-reaching, with potential scientific and practical contributions to transport and logistics, as well as significant social, economic, and environmental consequences. By funding this project, we can create a more sustainable, efficient, and publicly valuable city logistics system."
