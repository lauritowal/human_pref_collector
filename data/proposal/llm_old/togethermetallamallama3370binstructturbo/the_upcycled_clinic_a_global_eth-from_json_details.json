        "Title: The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative ethnographic project aimed at understanding the conditions that facilitate creative material engagement in clinics worldwide. The project, \"The Upcycled Clinic,\" focuses on addressing the problem of wastefulness in medicine by exploring repurposing practices in five distinct locations: Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K. Through fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets, a team of ethnographers will collaborate with clinic staff, including cleaners and laundry personnel, to investigate improvisation and material creativity in healthcare settings.\n\nBy adopting a global perspective, this project will contribute to the field of hospital ethnographies by moving beyond the traditional patient-encounter focus. It will also develop novel methods for reusing and sharing research materials, advancing theories of materiality and addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. The expected outcomes include articulating conditions for healthcare creativity and identifying local solutions to wastefulness and shortage, ultimately informing strategies for more sustainable and resourceful healthcare practices."
