        "Title: Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project exploring the development of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in Greater Gandhāra during the first millennium of the Common Era. Focusing on textual material in Indic languages, the project will investigate the production, transmission, and relationship networks of Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India. Recently discovered manuscripts from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand will be integral to the research. \n\nUsing philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, the project will analyze textual and material production, transmission, and networks. The expected outputs include a digital archive, an akṣara database, and digital preservation of the manuscripts, as well as editions, translations, and feature studies of the texts. The project will also conduct a multi-language content comparison, providing new insights into the development of Buddhism in the region. By tracing the evolution of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks, this project aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of the history of Buddhism in Greater Gandhāra."
