        "Title: Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\n\nThis interdisciplinary project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and musical creativity, examining the impact of creative AI on human relationships, art, culture, and society. The proposal aims to initiate public discourse on creative AI and develop a theoretical framework for transformed notions of self, others, and knowledge. Through the development of instruments with creative AI, exploration of human-AI collaboration in music, and use of sonic instruments as scientific instruments, this project seeks to understand the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and its reflection in future society.\n\nLed by a principal investigator with a background in music, philosophy, and computer science, this project brings together diverse scientific disciplines to investigate the benefits and implications of creative AI. The expected outcomes include the development of a theoretical framework for creative AI, the initiation of discourse on human-centered creative AI, and the definition of principles for ethical AI design in services and products. By using music as a platform, this project aims to establish a public understanding of AI and its potential to shape our understanding of art, culture, and society."
