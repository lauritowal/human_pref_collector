        "Title: Good Attention: Unveiling the Role of Attention Norms in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics (GOODATTENTION)\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to provide a groundbreaking philosophical investigation of attention norms, laying the groundwork for a novel framework to understand their emergence, evaluation, and integration into normative philosophy. The primary goal is to comprehend how attention norms arise within individual psychology and the social domain, with a focus on the hypothesis that fundamental attention norms concern relevance. \n\nThrough a combination of research activities, including the examination of biological relevance processing! and the role of social norms in guiding attention, this project aims to evaluate attention norms and their implications for decision-making, epistemology, and ethics. The expected impact of GOODATTENTION is twofold: to integrate norms of attention into various philosophical fields and to provide a foundational framework for policy-making. By developing a unified foundation for the study of attention norms, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of attention and its role in shaping human behavior and decision-making."
