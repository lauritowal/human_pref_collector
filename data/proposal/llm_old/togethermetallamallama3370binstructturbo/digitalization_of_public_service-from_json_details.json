        "Title: Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development\n\nAbstract:\nEach year, an estimated 5.7 million deaths and 100 million cases of poverty are attributed to inadequate access to public services. In response, governments worldwide are adopting digital technologies to enhance service delivery. While high-income countries have made significant progress, low-income countries face challenges, with one-third of digitalization projects being abandoned. This project aims to investigate the determinants of success or failure of digitalization and improve efficiency and inclusion! in public service delivery. In collaboration with local governments and NGOs, we will conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, focusing on demand for public services via digital access and supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. Our goal is to inform public policy in low-income countries and ultimately increase access to higher quality public services for a broader population segment, reducing poverty and mortality rates."
