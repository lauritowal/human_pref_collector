        "Title: Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan,\" seeks to advance our understanding of the neurocognitive architectures underlying predictive processing and its role in memory across different stages of human development. Using a predictive coding framework, our research aims to investigate the nature and influence of internal models on predictions and the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity resulting from maturation and senescence. \n\nWe will integrate predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs to examine episodic and semantic memory in children, younger adults, and older adults. Our study will focus on the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits and their impact on predictive processing. \n\nThe proposed project, PIVOTAL, has the potential to provide a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle, shedding light on the emergence of disorders at different life stages. By exploring the progression and conservation of predictive memory systems across the lifespan, this research aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of human cognition and its development."
