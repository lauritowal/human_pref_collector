        "Title: Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe during MIS3\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of climate change on the subsistence strategies of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Southern European peninsulas. By analyzing 20 key sites, our project will employ zooarchaeological analysis, taphonomic analysis, and stable isotope analysis to assess behavioral flexibility and resilience in response to climatic fluctuations. The objectives are to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions, develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity, and understand the subsistence patterns that favored AMH. The potential outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the subsistence patterns that contributed to AMH success and an assessment of the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction. This research has significant relevance to the study of prehistory on a pan-European scale, shedding light on the complex interactions between human populations and their environments during a critical period in human history."
