        "Title: OsciLang: A Neurofeedback System for Diagnosis and Intervention in Language and Reading Impairments\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of OsciLang, a wearable brain-computer-interface neurofeedback system designed to detect and treat language disorders, specifically dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). The system utilizes a novel approach, synchronizing brain activity with changes in speech signals, and focuses on phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech. Building on research indicating reduced auditory tracking in the delta band in dyslexic readers, OsciLang aims to improve literacy skills by enhancing brain-speech tracking capabilities, particularly in noisy environments. The system will use real-time EEG to quantify brain activity parameters, allowing users to exert top-down control over specific activation patterns. Key monitoring parameters include phase coherence at theta and delta bands. The expected outcome is improved literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia, with potential for extension to a broader framework for enhancing reading abilities. OsciLang promises an affordable, lightweight, and user-friendly solution for diagnosis and intervention, addressing a critical need in the treatment of language and reading impairments."
