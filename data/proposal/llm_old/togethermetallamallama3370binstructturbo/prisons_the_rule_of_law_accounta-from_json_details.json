        "Title: Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\nThis grant proposal aims to examine the experiences of mechanisms for securing rights and accountability in European prisons, with a focus on achieving adherence to the rule of law. The project, PRILA, seeks to address the overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences in prisons, ensuring fair treatment of prisoners, upholding their rights, and promoting just imprisonment and good order. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and sociology of punishment, PRILA will document the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies. The project will also study the structures for fair, transparent, and consistent decisions, appeal and review processes, and compliance with human rights principles. By advancing conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, PRILA aims to support better penal policies and practices, ultimately protecting the rule of law and rights in European prisons. The project's distinctiveness lies in its focus on the European experience of penal concepts, making it a unique contribution to the field."
