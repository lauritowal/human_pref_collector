        "Title: From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health\n\nThis socio-historical project examines the transition from international to global health governance in the post-World War II era, with a focus on the emergence of a new regime in the 1980s. The study will investigate the changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO) and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. Through historical and anthropological analyses, the project will explore the intersections of tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics. By examining the social worlds of laboratories, hospitals, and international organizations, this research aims to understand the shift from a focus on disease eradication to risk management and market-driven regulations. The expected outcomes include a nuanced understanding of global health as a locally practiced and knowledge-translated phenomenon, and insights into the circulation of ideas beyond traditional North-South transfers. Ultimately, this project seeks to illuminate the complexities of the transition from a Cold War-era political and economic order to a neo-liberal, multi-centric age of uncertainty, shedding light on the evolving landscape of global health governance."
