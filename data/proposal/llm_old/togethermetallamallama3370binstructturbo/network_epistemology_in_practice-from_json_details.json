        "Title: Network Epistemology in Practice: Unpacking Collective Knowledge Generation at CERN\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Network Epistemology in Practice,\" seeks to investigate the dynamics of knowledge generation and validation within large scientific collaborations, with a focus on particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). By leveraging digital humanities tools and computational methods, our research aims to characterize collective research processes through the analysis of internal communication, reconstructed from born-digital documents such as emails and internal wiki pages. The objectives of this project include understanding knowledge generation and validation, developing historiographic guidelines for future studies, and contributing to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation. Our methodological innovations, including the application of digital tools and computational methods, will address the challenge of capturing complex research processes for epistemological analysis. The expected outcomes of this project include historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources and practical strategies for best practices in the history and philosophy of science. By adapting theoretical models of network epistemology to the CERN case study, this project will provide novel insights into the nature of collective knowledge generation in large scientific collaborations."
