        "Title: Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in post-socialist cities. Millions of households in Eastern and Central Europe are affected by energy vulnerability, stemming from factors such as energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, and economic restructuring. Current conceptualizations of energy poverty are limited, focusing primarily on incomes and energy efficiency. This project will adopt an energy vulnerability framework, employing a comparative study approach that combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Case studies will be conducted in Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. The project aims to improve technical and institutional frameworks, provide affordable energy services, and contribute to climate change mitigation. By exploring the multifaceted nature of energy poverty, this research will transform our understanding of the issue and inform effective policy interventions to address the needs of vulnerable households in urban transitions."
