        "Title: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nAbstract:\nThe proposed project, \"Digital Twin Politics,\" aims to examine the socio-technical development and political implications of digital twins of the ocean (DTOs) in national and international contexts. As the European Commission builds a prototype DTO, this research will investigate the challenges, risks, and opportunities associated with DTOs, including time pressure, persisting data gaps, and the potential for perpetuating global inequalities. By re-conceptualizing digital twins as socio-technical relations, this project will develop a novel methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to study the practices, policies, and politics of digital twins in the EU, USA, and China. The project will also analyze the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations, shedding light on the role of digital twins in implementing global sustainability goals for ocean protection. By breaking new ground in the field, \"Digital Twin Politics\" will provide critical insights into the politics of digital twins and their potential to shape sustainable ocean futures."
