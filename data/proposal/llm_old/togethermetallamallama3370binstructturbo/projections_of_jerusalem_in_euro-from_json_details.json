        "Title: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project that explores the multimedia and interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe. The project aims to document, study, and conceptualize these re-creations, focusing on their role as icons, maps, and networks that shape devotional practices, memories, and sacred spaces. By examining hundreds of sites, the research will provide new insights into the cultural and historical significance of these monuments, shedding light on pilgrimage, sacred spaces, and mnemonic practices.\n\nThrough field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, the project will crystallize clusters of monuments and develop a comparative study. The research will yield various outputs throughout its stages, culminating in a comprehensive book that conceptualizes the monumental network of Jerusalem in Europe. This project will contribute significantly to the fields of pilgrimage, devotionalism, and memory studies, offering a unique perspective on the intersection of space, place, and interactive multimedia. By supporting this project, the grant will facilitate a groundbreaking study that will advance our understanding of the complex relationships between Jerusalem, Europe, and the cultural practices that shape our understanding of sacred spaces."
