        "Title: Students' Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education: The STUDACT Project\n\nAbstract:\nThe STUDACT project aims to investigate students' comprehension and adoption of Global Citizenship Education (GCE), a crucial component in transforming education systems and fostering peaceful, inclusive societies by 2030. Despite the importance of GCE, there is a lack of systematic research on students' understanding and appropriation of GCE. This project seeks to address this gap by exploring how students from diverse backgrounds in six countries (Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK) engage with GCE. Through a mixed-methods approach, including group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis, we will examine the factors influencing students' reception and application of GCE. Our research questions focus on understanding students' perceptions, appropriation, and attitudes towards GCE, as well as the variations within and between countries, curricula, and education systems. By treating students as core partners and agentic participants, STUDACT aims to provide valuable insights into the complexities of GCE and inform policies, curricula, and teacher training programs to empower learners and build more inclusive societies."
