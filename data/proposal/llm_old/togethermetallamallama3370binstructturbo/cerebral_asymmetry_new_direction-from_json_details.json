        "Title: CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore functional cerebral asymmetry, 150 years after Broca's discovery, by investigating impaired language development through a multidisciplinary approach. Our key hypothesis, the \"Network Efficiency Hypothesis,\" will be tested through a series of projects. We will employ behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify individual differences in language lateralization patterns. Additionally, we will use simulations from genetic models and analyze twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization to inform our research. A \"Double Hit Genetic Model\" will be applied to individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin, caused by an extra sex chromosome, to predict neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We will also search for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements in individuals with inconsistent language laterality patterns. Our goal is to elucidate the etiology of language and literacy impairment, with a focus on the role of cerebral asymmetry. By combining genetic and neuropsychological approaches, this project aims to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between brain structure, function, and language development."
