        "Title: The Everyday Politics of Famine\n\nAbstract:\nFamines are increasingly frequent and devastating, affecting 250,000 people in 2022 and putting 35 million more at risk. The proposed project, \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" aims to investigate the everyday politics of famine in affected communities, with a focus on South Sudan and Somalia. Through an ethnographically-informed comparative study, our research team, comprising predominantly Somali and South Sudanese members with extensive experience and established networks, will explore the complex dynamics of famine persistence. Our research will examine four key strands: the histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives that shape social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. By shedding light on the everyday politics of famine, this project seeks to understand why famines persist, challenge the existing science of famine politics, and contribute to a shift in the normalization of deadly famines. Ultimately, our goal is to uncover the mechanisms of blame displacement for famine suffering and inform more effective strategies for famine prevention and response."
