        "This grant proposal, \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" seeks to develop an alternative theory of moral progress. The project challenges current limitations, such as parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin, to extend moral concern beyond ethically arbitrary features like class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. By focusing on different forms of moral progress, moral attitudes, and smart institutions, this research aims to bypass the limits of our inherited psychology. Building on the \"expanding circle\" account of moral progress, this project will provide a novel framework for understanding and promoting moral growth, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and equitable society. The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory that can guide efforts to overcome existing ethical barriers and foster a broader moral concern."
