        "Title: Energy and Emissions Thresholds for Providing Decent Living Standards to All\n\nThis grant proposal aims to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts required to provide decent living standards to all, with a focus on 5 emerging economies. The project seeks to answer key research questions, including what constitutes decent living standards, the energy resources required to provide these goods and services, and how these needs evolve as countries develop. The objectives of this project are to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts, identify low-carbon pathways, and inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. Using lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling, this project will operationalize basic needs views of human development, quantify energy needs and emissions, and analyze path dependencies in the evolution of basic goods. By considering contextual factors such as culture, climate, and technology, this project will provide critical insights into the energy and emissions thresholds required to achieve decent living standards while mitigating climate change."
