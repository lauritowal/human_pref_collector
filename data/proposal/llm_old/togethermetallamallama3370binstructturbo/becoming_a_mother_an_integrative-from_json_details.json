        "Title: Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood\n\nThis prospective longitudinal study proposes to develop a comprehensive model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The project aims to establish the onset and evolution of brain changes in pregnant women, characterize cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, and assess the impact of environmental and psychological factors on maternal adaptations. Additionally, the study will identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations and integrate findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework.\n\nThe study will involve three groups of nulliparous women: those undergoing full-term pregnancy, those whose same-sex partners are undergoing full-term pregnancy, and a control group. Data will be collected at five time points, including pre-pregnancy, intra-pregnancy, and postpartum sessions, using neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data types. The expected deliverables include a longitudinal RDoC-based model, intermediate longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sectional analyses. This project will provide a deeper understanding of the complex adaptations that occur during the transition to motherhood, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to support maternal mental health and well-being."
