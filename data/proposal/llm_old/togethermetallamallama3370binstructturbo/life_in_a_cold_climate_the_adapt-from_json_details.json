        "Title: Life in a Cold Climate: The Adaptation of Cereals to New Environments and the Establishment of Agriculture in Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the adaptation of cereals, specifically barley and wheat, to new environments during the introduction of agriculture in Europe. The primary objective is to assess the influence of environmental adaptation on the spread of agriculture and its adoption as a primary subsistence strategy. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, including population genomics, ecological modeling, and ancient DNA sequencing, this project aims to identify loci under selection in cereal genomes and associate them with ecogeographical variables.\n\nThe expected outputs of this project include the identification of adaptation periods, synthesis of environmental adaptations with archaeological evidence, and correlation with demographic data. This research will provide valuable insights into Neolithic population dynamics and crop productivity, correcting the current imbalance between human and environmental dimensions in domestication studies. Ultimately, this project will enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between ecological pressures, crop adaptation, and human migration, shedding light on the establishment of agriculture in Europe. The proposed research has significant implications for our understanding of the past and will contribute to the development of more sustainable agricultural practices in the future."
