        "Title: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal seeks to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, with a specific focus on the neurotransmitter GABA. Despite being genetically identical to a degree of 99%, individual differences in human behaviour and brain function can be significantly influenced by the distinctness of gut bacteria, which can range from 40% to 90%. With a bacteria-to-human cell ratio of 1:1 and a bacteria-to-human DNA ratio of 10:1, the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters, such as GABA and serotonin, on brain and behaviour is a critical knowledge gap that this project aims to address.\n\nThrough a biochemically informed approach, this project will employ direct and proxy measures to assay the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults. The project consists of two work packages: the first investigates the relationship between gut bacteria and brain GABA levels using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, while the second tests the impact of a custom-made probiotic containing GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour over a four-week period. By bridging psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, this project aims to advance our understanding of the impact of gut bacteria and probiotics on brain GABA levels and function, ultimately shedding light on individual differences in human behaviour and brain function."
