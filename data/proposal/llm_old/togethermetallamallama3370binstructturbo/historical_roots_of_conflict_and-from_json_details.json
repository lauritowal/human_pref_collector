        "Title: Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a two-part research project investigating the impact of historical factors on conflict and economic development. The first part of the project will utilize administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America (1492-1599) to examine the relationship between institutions, human capital, and economic development. By analyzing data on the town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and city of arrival in the Americas, this study will employ a within-country analysis to explore the role of institutional variation during the initial colonization period.\n\nThe second part of the project will construct a dataset using archaeological evidence to locate ancient conflicts and examine their long-run dynamics. This analysis will investigate the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict, providing insights into the persistence of historical factors in shaping modern outcomes. The proposed research will contribute to our understanding of the complex and enduring relationships between historical events, institutions, and economic development, with a focus on Latin America and other regions. By exploring the historical roots of conflict and development, this project aims to inform policy and promote more effective strategies for promoting economic growth and reducing conflict."
