        "Title: Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the way historians create, curate, and analyze digital data about historical phenomena. Focusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095) in the eastern half of Christendom and newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe, our project will develop and test a novel framework for reframing historical data as linked assertions tied to authoritative sources. This approach will enable the manipulation of data according to source and authority, as well as the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict.\n\nBy acknowledging the complexity of pre-modern history and the scarcity of undisputed facts, our project will provide a more nuanced understanding of trans-regional trends and patterns. Our interdisciplinary approach combines prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology to examine historical events from multiple perspectives. The ultimate goal is to create a traceable authority framework that allows historians to contextualize and reuse existing online data, preventing waste and promoting a more comprehensive understanding of the past. By achieving this goal, our project will make a significant contribution to the field of medieval history and provide a model for digital historical research that can be applied to other periods and regions."
