        "Title: Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the peopling of Australasia by circa 50,000 years ago, a pivotal event in human history marked by the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the first 'open water' crossing. Our multidisciplinary approach combines archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics to examine the when, where, who, and how of earliest seafaring, focusing on the Sunda and Sahul regions. \n\nObjectives include researching the submerged palaeolandscape, identifying potential submerged prehistoric sites, and enhancing understanding of palaeoshoreline and tidal regimes. We will utilize mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and dating. Expected outcomes include refined knowledge of onshore/offshore environments, insights into human origins, population dynamics, and migration, as well as understanding of seafaring technology and social organisation. This project aims to significantly advance our understanding of human colonization and the technological and cognitive aspects of seafaring, shedding light on a crucial period in human history."
