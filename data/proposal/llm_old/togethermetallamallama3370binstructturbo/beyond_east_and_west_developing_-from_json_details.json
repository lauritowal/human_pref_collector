        "Title: Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to foster a transcultural musical practice by integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. The project aims to achieve this by training traditional instrumentalists and singers in new repertoire, as well as teaching Western singers non-Western vocal techniques. Through research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, the project will develop an ensemble interface with newly designed instruments and produce studies on timbre. Additionally, it will establish a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems, promoting a deeper understanding of their intersections.\n\nThe expected outputs include an e-book, an orchestration manual, and online audio and visual examples, all to be published by Cambridge University Press. By developing approaches to model music's impacts on musicians and audiences, this project will provide a groundbreaking model for transcultural musical practice, ultimately overcoming cultural barriers and promoting cross-cultural understanding. The project's innovative approach will pave the way for a new era of musical collaboration and exchange between Eastern and Western musical traditions."
