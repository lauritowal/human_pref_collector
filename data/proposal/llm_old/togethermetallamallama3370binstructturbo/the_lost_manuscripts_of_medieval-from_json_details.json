        "Title: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal, LostMa, seeks to investigate the transmission of medieval texts as a dynamic process, akin to cultural evolution. Our primary objective is to understand how human cultures evolve through the transmission of written artifacts, with a focus on the role of chance, human agency, and the mechanisms of manuscript copying, transformation, and destruction. We will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to analyze the transmission of chivalric literature in the European context, with a particular focus on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts out of a total of 4000 documents. Our methods will include stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection. By examining the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons, LostMa aims to shed new light on the complex dynamics of cultural transmission and the evolution of human cultures. The project's outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of humans in shaping cultural heritage and the factors influencing the preservation or loss of written artifacts."
