        "Title: The Cognitive Primers of Human Culture: A Comparative Approach to the Emergence of Innovations\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a 4-year comparative study investigating the conditions driving innovations across primates, with a focus on the emergence of sharp stone tool creation and usage. Our objectives are to define the baseline stone manipulation abilities of chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques using artificial intelligence coding methods, test the roles of exposure and experience in driving innovations, and compare primate assemblages to the oldest human stone tools. \n\nUsing a triangulation approach, experimental paradigm, and large sample sizes (N=350), we will examine the cognitive capacities underlying innovation in non-human primates. Our research will provide an enhanced understanding of the conditions required for innovations and the primers of human culture, shedding light on when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. The proposed study will contribute significantly to the field of cognitive evolution and cultural development, offering insights into the fundamental drivers of human innovation."
