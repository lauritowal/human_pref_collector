        "Title: De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a research project that seeks to reassess the early history of European political economy by examining the practical concerns and policies of improvement in eighteenth-century Sweden. The project will focus on the Swedish Empire as its primary case study, with comparative analyses of other cases to ensure broad applicability. By exploring the concepts of improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare, this research aims to challenge conventional narratives of political economy and provide a more nuanced understanding of the historical development of these ideas.\n\nThe project will investigate the discursive production sites of political economy, including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, to understand how activities in these sites contributed to the improvement of state and society. The hypothesis guiding this research is that these sites were directed towards enhancing the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the history of political economy and its relevance to contemporary debates about growth, wealth, and welfare."
