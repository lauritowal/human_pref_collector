        "Title: From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of firm-level heterogeneity on international trade patterns and welfare effects. The project aims to revisit conventional trade models, which assume homogeneous firms, and explore the key dimensions where firm heterogeneity alters the outcomes. The research will be conducted in the context of Europe, where protectionist pressures and nationalistic tendencies are on the rise, and will address three primary questions: What determines international trade patterns and associated welfare effects? Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? And should governments intervene in international transactions?\n\nThe project consists of four work packages, focusing on market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities. By examining the implications of firm heterogeneity on trade patterns and policies, this project aims to provide new insights into the design of optimal trade agreements and the maximization of joint welfare for trade partners. The ultimate goal is to enhance our understanding of the aggregate implications of firm-level heterogeneity in international trade and inform policy decisions in the face of rising protectionism and disenchantment with globalization."
