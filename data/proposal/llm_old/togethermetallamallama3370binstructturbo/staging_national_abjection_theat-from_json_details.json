        "Title: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a transdisciplinary research project analyzing the role of theatre in shaping national identity, abjection, and belonging in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a combination of theoretical and ethnographic research methods, this study will investigate how theatre reflects and influences the political economy of Turkey under a conservative neoliberal government. The project will focus on case studies including theatre productions involving Armenians, queer dramas, Islamic theatre, Sephardic Jewish theatre, and Alevi theatre, among others. The research objectives aim to provide insights into the constitution of the Turkish nation and its Others, the politics of belonging, and the relationship between artistic performance and citizenship. By exploring diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, this project will advance understanding of cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies, shedding light on the political tensions defining Turkey and its growing diasporas."
