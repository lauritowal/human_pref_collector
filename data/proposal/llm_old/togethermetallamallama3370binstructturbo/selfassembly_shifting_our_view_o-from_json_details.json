        "Title: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\n\nThis grant proposal, \"AssemblingLife,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by developing a new theoretical framework based on self-assembly processes. Currently, biology emphasizes the need for constant energy input and genetic regulation to sustain life. In contrast, self-assembly enables the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structures without external guidance. By integrating insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science, this project aims to challenge traditional views of genetic causation and scientific explanation.\n\nThe proposed research has two primary objectives: (1) to develop a new understanding of genetic causation, where genes act as \"nudgers\" rather than sole determinants, and (2) to establish a novel theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes. The potential impacts of this project are far-reaching, with the potential to shift our fundamental understanding of life in both science and philosophy. By providing new conceptual tools for the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences, \"AssemblingLife\" can pave the way for innovative approaches to understanding and explaining complex biological phenomena."
