        "Title! Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times\n\nThis project, CROME, proposes a diachronic and comparative analysis of memories and silences surrounding the colonial-liberation wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. Focusing on Portugal and its former African colonies (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe), the research aims to produce innovative knowledge about war memories and silences. The project's key hypothesis is that these wars triggered memorialization and silencing with their own historicity. Through two main strands, \"Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States\" and \"Memory as a battlefield,\" CROME will examine the role of states in shaping memories, the dynamics between social and individual memories, and the evolution of memories and silences from the end of conflicts to the present. By contrasting historical judgments and memories in Portugal and African countries, CROME seeks to offer a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies and address the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism."
