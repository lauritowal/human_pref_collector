        "Title: Repetition, Parallelism and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition (REPAC)\n\nThis project explores the intricate relationship between textual form and function in Ancient Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions, with a focus on the first millennium BCE. By examining the use of repetition, parallelism, and other literary devices in Akkadian texts written in Cuneiform on clay tablets, we aim to shed light on the creative efforts of Ancient Mesopotamian scribes. The investigation will analyze various genres, including literary, magical, and mantic texts, to understand how these devices contributed to poetic creativity, rhetorical effectiveness, and argumentation inventiveness. The expected outcome is an improved understanding of Ancient Mesopotamian creative effort and the role of analogy and worldview in their literary and scholarly methods, addressing a significant knowledge gap in the field. By elucidating the complex interplay between textual features and functions, this project will provide new insights into the construction of meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian literature and erudition."
