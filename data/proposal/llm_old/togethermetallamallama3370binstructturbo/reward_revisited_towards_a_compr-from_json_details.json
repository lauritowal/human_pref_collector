        "Title: Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a novel, unifying framework for understanding how reward influences human cognition. By integrating conceptual and neural perspectives, our project aims to extend the current understanding of reward effects on cognitive operations, including motivation, conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. We will investigate the interplay between reward and factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, and response modes, while also examining the impact of irrelevant information. \n\nTo achieve our goals, we will employ optimized neuroimaging methods to examine neural activity in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. This research has significant implications for basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research, providing insights into the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals and disturbances in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease. By exploring the complex relationships between reward, cognition, and neural systems, our project will contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for related disorders."
