        "Title: Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\n\nThis longitudinal grant proposal seeks to investigate the dynamic interplay between social networks and the social brain in adolescents. Our study will integrate social network research and social brain research, focusing on social-cognitive functions in a cohort of 1000 adolescents from 50 classes. Over three years, we will conduct six measurements, utilizing social network analysis, social neuroscience experimental approaches, and ecological momentary assessment techniques. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo yearly fMRI scans to examine brain network development. \n\nBy collecting social networks data through surveys and mobile sensing, we aim to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development. Experimental tasks will assess understanding and interaction with others, providing valuable insights into adolescent social cognition. This study will significantly contribute to our understanding of adolescent development, ultimately informing interventions to support healthy social and brain development in this critical phase of life."
