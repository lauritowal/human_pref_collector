        "Title: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the theory of decentralized trade in the presence of informational asymmetries and limited commitment. In most trading situations, parties have unequal access to information, leading to market inefficiencies. Examples of such asymmetries include professional investors and individuals in financial markets, as well as consumers' private information about their willingness to pay. The standard theory of mechanism design often relies on strong commitment assumptions and focuses on single-instance trading, which does not account for repeated transactions common in non-durable goods and services, or durable but divisible goods.\n\nThrough a systematic game-theoretic analysis, this project aims to understand the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, explore remedies for enhanced efficiency, and contribute to the design of market institutions. The ultimate goal is to inform market regulation and improve market efficiency. By examining repeated transactions in decentralized markets with informational asymmetries, this project will provide valuable insights into the functioning of these markets and identify potential solutions to mitigate the negative effects of informational asymmetries. The expected outcomes will have significant implications for market design, regulation, and economic efficiency."
