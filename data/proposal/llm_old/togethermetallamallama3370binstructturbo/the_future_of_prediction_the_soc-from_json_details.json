        "Title: The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine and Policing\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and its far-reaching consequences for social institutions. Focusing on the domains of insurance, medicine, and policing, our interdisciplinary research will explore the intersection of Big Data, Machine Learning, and digital forecasting. We will examine the impact of personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing on individuals and society, with a particular emphasis on the challenges posed by the individualization of prediction, the undermining of the mutualization principle, and the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods. \n\nA key aspect of our research will be addressing the problem of bias in algorithmic prediction and the distinction between prevention and repression. By analyzing the social consequences of algorithmic forecasting, our project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the increasing reliance on predictive technologies in critical social sectors. The expected outcomes of this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars, ultimately informing the development of more equitable and effective prediction-based systems."
