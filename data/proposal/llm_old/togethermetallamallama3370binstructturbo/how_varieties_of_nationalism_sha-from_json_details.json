        "Title: How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of nationalism on the polarization of electoral politics in advanced democracies. By adopting a multi-method comparative research design, our project aims to challenge the conventional framework of transnational cleavage based on cultural conflict. Instead, we will explore the diverse varieties of nationalism and their effects on partisan divisions. The research will be conducted through three work packages: analyzing novel survey data to study public conceptions of nationalism, examining elite mobilization efforts based on different varieties of nationalism, and exploring the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility. This project expects to contribute to academic research advancements and enrich public debate on societal challenges. By assessing the potential for national identities to bring people together, our research seeks to provide new insights into the complex relationship between nationalism and polarization, ultimately informing strategies to mitigate partisan divisions and promote social cohesion."
