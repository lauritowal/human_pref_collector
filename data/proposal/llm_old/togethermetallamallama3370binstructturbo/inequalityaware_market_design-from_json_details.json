        "Title: Inequality-aware Market Design\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that account for inequalities, challenging the conventional opposition to market interventions due to allocative inefficiency. The project, grounded in the Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD) theoretical framework, utilizes a mechanism-design framework to develop a welfare function that maximizes welfare with redistributive preferences. By considering private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights, this research aims to investigate the trade-offs between allocative efficiency and desirable surplus splits when inequalities are detectable. The main hypothesis is that sacrificing allocative efficiency may be necessary to achieve a desirable surplus split in the presence of inequalities. This project contributes to the field by addressing inequality in market-design settings and distinguishing itself from traditional mechanism-design approaches focused on efficiency and revenue. The findings will provide policy guidance on distortionary market interventions, such as rent control and healthcare, and offer a complementary approach to public-finance through the tax system."
