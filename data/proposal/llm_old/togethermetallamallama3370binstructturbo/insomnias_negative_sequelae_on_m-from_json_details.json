        "Title: Insomnia's Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal addresses the critical issue of insomnia as a significant risk factor for depression in the elderly population. With up to 40% of older adults experiencing insomnia and a 13% increased risk of developing depression, early identification and preventive intervention are crucial. Our project aims to identify at-risk individuals, quantify the underlying mechanisms, and enroll them in tailored intervention protocols. Using a multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging approach, we will identify insomnia subtypes and their corresponding mechanisms. An interdisciplinary strategy will be employed to optimize internet-supported, home-applicable interventions focusing on sleep improvement and depression prevention. The expected outcomes include subtype profiling, mechanism profiling, and intervention optimization. By targeting insomnia as a key risk factor, this project seeks to reduce the prevalence of depression in the elderly, ultimately improving their quality of life. Our preventive intervention approach has the potential to make a significant impact on public health, particularly in the aging population."
