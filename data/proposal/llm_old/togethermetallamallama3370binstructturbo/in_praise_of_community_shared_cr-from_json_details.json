        "Title: In Praise of Community: Shared Creativity in Arts and Politics in Italy (1959-1979)\n\nThis grant proposal, \"In Praise of Community,\" seeks to explore the intersection of performing arts and commonality practices in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. By studying artist collaborations and applying the concept of \"will-to-the-common\" to counterculture art, this project aims to highlight the significance of artistic communities locally and internationally. The research will draw on historical, philosophical, artistic, and sociological debates, as well as social network theory. \n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing new models for interpreting performing arts knowledge and creating an innovative digital archive visualization. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive approach to collecting, digitizing, restoring, and disseminating Italian performing arts heritage, ultimately preserving this vital aspect of the country's cultural legacy. By analyzing the practice of commonality in the performing arts, this project will provide a unique perspective on the role of artistic communities in shaping cultural and political discourse. The creation of a digital archive of Italian artists' performances will serve as a valuable resource for scholars and the general public, promoting a deeper understanding of Italy's rich cultural heritage."
