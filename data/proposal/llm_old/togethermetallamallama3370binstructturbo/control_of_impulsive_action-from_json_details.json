        "Title: Control of Impulsive Action\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and their improvement for individual and societal benefit. The project will investigate key research questions, including the emergence of novel impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions, and the impact of learning on impulsive behavior. Using a combination of behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, we aim to develop a comprehensive model of impulsive action. Our objectives include specifying the origin and control of impulsive actions, replacing dominant 'inhibitory control' models, and explaining impulsivity across time and space. Additionally, we will develop a new behavioral model of impulsive action, understand individual differences in impulsivity, and elucidate the causes of disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. By achieving these objectives, this project will provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms underlying impulsive behavior, ultimately informing the development of effective interventions and treatments."
