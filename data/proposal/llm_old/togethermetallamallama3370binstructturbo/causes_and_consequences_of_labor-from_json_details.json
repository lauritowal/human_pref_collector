        "Title: Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility (LABFLEX)\n\nThis grant proposal, LABFLEX, aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization, technological change, and workplace transformation. The project will focus on the organization of labor and the impacts of labor market flexibility on wage inequality, division of resources, and social concerns. Key developments to be examined include outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs. \n\nThe proposed research will address critical questions, such as the relationship between job contract differences and worker preferences or technological advancements, the effects of job contract flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps, and the role of labor market institutions and policies. By linking register data to experimental evidence on worker preferences, analyzing job vacancies, and combining experimental and structural methods, LABFLEX will provide new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility. The project's outcomes will contribute to a detailed understanding of the supply and demand sides of the labor market, facilitating informed decision-making on labor market policies and institutions."
