        "Title: Non-elected politics. Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\n\nThis project investigates the impact of delegating decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. The crisis is characterized by growing citizen disengagement, low electoral turnout, and declining trust in institutions. Despite the paradox that non-elected politics contradicts the principle of elected control, many European countries are exploring institutional reforms to revitalize democracy. Our central hypothesis is that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. To test this, we will conduct a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, compile a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and analyze the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy. Using online survey experiments and panel surveys, this research aims to provide insights into the effects of non-elected politics on the crisis of representative democracy, with far-reaching implications for societal and institutional reforms. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between citizen engagement, institutional trust, and democratic revitalization."
