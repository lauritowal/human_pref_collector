        "Title: Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex relationships between environmental regulation, labor, and health in post-industrial Europe. The project prioritizes policy-making due to the pressing issues of global climate change and increasing demand for environmental quality. Focusing on the main origin of regulated pollution, the combustion of fossil fuels, this research aims to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management.\n\nThe project consists of two parts: the first examines the economic implications of local air quality changes resulting from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, while the second explores the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. By developing new tools for economic impact analysis and incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of environmental, labor, and health outcomes. With its potential to have a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus, this research aims to equip policymakers with the necessary evidence to make informed decisions."
