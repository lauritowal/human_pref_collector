        "Title: Portable EEG-based Screening of Social Predispositions in Newborns\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a portable, wireless EEG-based device designed to screen newborns for social predispositions, with a focus on early identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) biomarkers. The proposed device will utilize innovative oscillatory visual presentation and dry electrodes to capture an EEG-based index of face processing in less than 2 minutes of visual attention. An automatic on-line extraction algorithm will enable rapid and easy testing in any context, including home testing and research settings.\n\nThe device addresses a significant market gap, as no fully portable EEG system for newborns is currently available. The technology has the potential to facilitate early behavioral intervention for ASD and enable large-scale screening protocols. By merging an innovative experimental paradigm with portable EEG technology, this project aims to develop an early, objective EEG-based biomarker for newborns at risk. The proposed device has far-reaching implications for the identification and treatment of ASD, and its development could significantly impact our understanding of the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions in newborns."
