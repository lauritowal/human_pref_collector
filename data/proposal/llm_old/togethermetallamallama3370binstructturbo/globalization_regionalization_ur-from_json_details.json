        "Title: Globalization, Regionalization, Urbanization: An Analysis of the Worldwide Maritime Network since the Early 18th Century\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive analysis of the worldwide maritime network from a historical perspective, spanning nearly 300 years. The primary goal is to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime viewpoint, utilizing Lloyd's List register as the primary data source. The project aims to achieve three main objectives: (1) map the spatial distribution of maritime flows through dynamic visualizations, (2) analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links using graph theory and social network analysis, and (3) study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development by integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics. By exploring the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development, this project will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of globalization, regionalization, and urbanization over time. The expected outcomes include interactive visualizations, a geomatics visualization platform, and a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between maritime transport, urban development, and economic growth."
