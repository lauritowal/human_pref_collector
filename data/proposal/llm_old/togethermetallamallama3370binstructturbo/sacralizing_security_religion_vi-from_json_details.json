        "Title: Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project examining the complex relationships between religion, violence, and authority in mega-cities of the Global South. The project, SACRASEC, will investigate why residents grant authority to religious vigilantes and the role of religion in legitimizing their practices. Through ethnographic comparison of case studies in Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, the project will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes and draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance. The research aims to contribute to the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, provide knowledge on power structures in mega-cities, and inform policies aimed at improving human security. By exploring the intersections of religion, violence, and authority, this project will shed light on the dynamics of governance and security in urban areas of the Global South."
