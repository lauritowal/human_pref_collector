        "Title: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, specifically why certain visual stimuli are perceived consciously while others are not. Building on our previous work demonstrating that weak simple stimuli can be reported when they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, we aim to investigate the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory. Our research will focus on comparing the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across various brain regions, including the visual cortex, which acts as a relay station for simple stimuli, and higher cortical areas involved in scene segmentation and visual attention.\n\nUsing a combination of methods, including single-neuron recordings in human patients and monkeys, functional imaging, and perturbation techniques, we will characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will also investigate the \"functional connectome\" to identify brain regions where activity leads to a reportable experience. Our expected outcomes include providing insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception, shedding light on the complex interactions between attention, working memory, and conscious awareness. This project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the neural basis of consciousness and its underlying mechanisms."
