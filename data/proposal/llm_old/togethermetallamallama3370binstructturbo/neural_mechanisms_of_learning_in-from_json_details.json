        "Title: Neural Mechanisms of Learning in the Infant Brain: From Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying learning in the infant brain, with a focus on language and complex social interactions. Our project will investigate how infants, from 6 months of gestation to the end of their first year, develop the ability to process statistical patterns and transition to understanding rules and symbols. We will employ a range of techniques, including EEG, MRI, and optical topography, to examine the human cerebral architecture and its access to a rich symbolic system. The project is organized into six work packages, each addressing a specific aspect of infant learning, such as age-related statistical inferences, neural bases of word meaning, and symbolic competency criteria. Our ultimate goal is to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits. By achieving this, we aim to contribute significantly to our understanding of infant brain development and its implications for human learning and cognition."
