        "Title: The Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Adversity\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative initiative to develop a unified data infrastructure for analyzing multiple layers of childhood adversity across three generations of 2 million people. By integrating interdisciplinary methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework, this project aims to uncover the long-lasting effects of intersecting biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental adversity layers. Currently, the literature focuses primarily on social adversity, but this project will redirect the focus to the multiple layers of adversity that establish health inequality in childhood and persist transgenerationally. The goals of this project are to understand patterns of adversity, generate mechanisms, and study the dynamics of change. A real-world policy data lab will be established to integrate nationwide policies, simulate interventions, and identify targets for support, ultimately informing policies that benefit children and families. By shedding light on the complex interactions between multiple layers of childhood adversity, this project will provide critical insights for policymakers and practitioners to develop effective interventions and mitigate the lasting impacts of adversity."
