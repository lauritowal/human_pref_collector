        "Title: Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a historical research project examining the role of Japanese courts-martial and military courts during the Asia-Pacific War. The study will focus on the period between 1937 and 1945, with a geographical scope encompassing East Asia and Southeast Asia. By analyzing the interactions between Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy soldiers, this project aims to understand how military justice was used to regulate violence, deter and coerce civilian populations, and legitimize Japan's war efforts.\n\nThrough an in-depth analysis of legal practices and the routinization and escalation of violence, this research will investigate the outcomes of these courts, including executions and harsh imprisonments. The project will draw on original archival work, contributing to the fields of modern Japanese history and international law. The findings of this study will have significant implications for contemporary humanitarian issues, providing historical insights into the dynamics of violence and military justice. By exploring the darker aspects of Japan's wartime past, this project seeks to shed new light on the complexities of military justice and its ongoing relevance in today's world."
