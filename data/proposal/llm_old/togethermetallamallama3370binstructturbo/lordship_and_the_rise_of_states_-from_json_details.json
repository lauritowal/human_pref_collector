        "Title: Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to challenge the conventional understanding of state formation in Western Europe between 1300 and 1600. Our research hypothesis posits that the decentralization of legal authority, rather than centralized control, played a crucial role in the rise of states during this period. By examining the complex relationships between princes, elites, and local representation, we aim to contribute to a new interpretation of state formation. \n\nOur project will focus on five case study regions: Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire. We will analyze the interplay between state formation, urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent, using a path-dependency analytical framework. The proposed research will not only improve our social history of power but also integrate Western Europe with Central and Eastern Europe, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of state development. \n\nThe innovative methodology and interdisciplinary approach of this project will provide new insights into the dynamics of state formation, questioning the traditional top-down assumption of centralization and instead highlighting the significance of bottom-up representation and the role of elites in supporting decentralized authority."
