        "Title: Between Canon and Coincidence: Using Data-Driven Approaches to Understand Art Worlds (BECACO)\n\nThis project proposes a large-scale study of the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections, focusing on Indigenous Latin American material. By reconceptualizing provenance as a socio-politico-historical analysis, BECACO aims to introduce \"Art World Patterns\" â€“ a concept originally introduced by Becker in 1982. Using quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining, we will analyze a large corpus of provenance data from 12 museums across 9 European countries, spanning 1850-2000. The expected outcomes include new models for provenance research and conceptual and methodological advances. Ultimately, BECACO seeks to enhance our understanding of the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of cultural material translocation."
