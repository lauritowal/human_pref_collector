        "Title: Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal addresses the critical global issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting over 2 billion people in low-income countries. While current solutions focus on increasing agricultural production and access to calories, the role of forests in dietary diversification remains a significant blind spot. Our project aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality. We will develop a framework on forest-diet linkages and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality, highlighting the benefits of wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock. Through a multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach, we will explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes, identify hotspots, and conduct in-depth fieldwork in two locations to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes. Our expected outcome is a shift in food security conceptualization, recognizing the vital role of forests in supporting people's dietary quality and informing more effective solutions to address nutrient deficiencies worldwide."
