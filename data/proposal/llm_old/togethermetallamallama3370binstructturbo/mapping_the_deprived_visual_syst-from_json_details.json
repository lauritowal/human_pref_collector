        "Title: Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction (MADVIS)\n\nThis proposal seeks to understand how visual deprivation at different developmental stages affects the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. By studying the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight recovery, we aim to predict outcomes of sight restoration. Our interdisciplinary approach combines cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology to investigate how brain regions adapt to process stimuli in the absence of visual input. The expected impact of this project includes advancing our understanding of experience-dependent brain shaping, bridging the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, and developing predictive tools for sensory restoration procedures. The MADVIS project will ultimately contribute to improving outcomes for individuals undergoing sight restoration procedures."
