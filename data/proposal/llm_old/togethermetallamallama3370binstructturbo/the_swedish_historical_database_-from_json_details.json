        "Title: The Swedish Historical Database Project\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a comprehensive historical database covering 2500 Swedish administrative districts from 1749 to 1952. The database will contain approximately 500,000 observations per variable, encompassing economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, and other social and economic indicators. A key feature of this project is its unique provision of continuous, reliable population data starting from 1749, offering unparalleled insights into Sweden's economic growth and development over two centuries.\n\nThe database's comprehensive and localized nature, combined with its international perspective, will enable researchers to explore various aspects of economic development, structural transformation, and growth. Empirical identification strategies, including instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation, will be employed to analyze the data. This project has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of economic history, with planned research focusing on economic development and growth. By making this database publicly available, we aim to facilitate innovative research and advance our understanding of Sweden's historical economic trajectory."
