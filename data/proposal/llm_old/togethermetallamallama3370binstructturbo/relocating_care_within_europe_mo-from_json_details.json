        "Title: Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the elderly to places where care is more affordable\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multi-sited anthropological study exploring the transnationalization of care and care relocation, particularly the phenomenon of \"ageing body relocation\" to affordable care locations. The project focuses on the marketization of care, where elderly individuals from Austria and Germany are relocated to care homes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where costs are approximately one-third of those in their home countries. The study will investigate the entanglement of welfare states and entitlements across borders, examining the intersection of labour migration, real estate investment, state insurances, and regional migration. Through in-depth ethnographic studies, investigation of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and histories of places, this project aims to understand the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and the implications of care relocation as part of future making. By examining the responses to privatization of care landscapes, this research will shed light on what it means to become old and in need of care in an intertwined Europe, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding elderly care in the region."
