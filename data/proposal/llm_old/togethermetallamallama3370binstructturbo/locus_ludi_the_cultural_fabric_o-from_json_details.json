        "Title: Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary project that aims to provide the first comprehensive study of play and games in classical antiquity. The project, \"Locus Ludi,\" will explore the evidence of play and games in the Greek world (c. 800 BCE - 146 BCE) and the Roman world (c. 500 BCE - c. 500 CE), examining the participation of diverse groups, including free men, slaves, men, women, adults, children, and even gods. The study will investigate play and games in various environments, such as towns and countryside, using a range of source types, including written, archaeological, and iconographic materials.\n\nThe project will adopt a multifaceted approach, incorporating linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological perspectives. Additionally, it will engage with related fields, including gender studies and education studies. The expected outcomes of the project include the development of training models, research models, and educational materials for schools, museums, and libraries. By exploring the cultural significance of play and games in classical antiquity, \"Locus Ludi\" will contribute to a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and historical contexts of ancient civilizations. The project's findings will have far-reaching implications for various fields of study and will provide a unique perspective on the role of play and games in shaping human culture."
