        "Title: Forced Migration and Development\n\nAbstract:\nThe proposed project, Forced Migration and Development (FORCEDMIGDEV), aims to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries. With over 68.5 million displaced individuals worldwide, 85% of whom are hosted by developing countries, understanding the impacts of forced migration is crucial for informed policy decisions. This project consists of two main parts: the first focuses on refugee inflows, developing a structural model to estimate the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare effects across regions, and the effects of legal status for refugees, using the case of Syrian refugees in Turkey as a primary example. The second part investigates climate shocks on internal displacement, combining reduced-form and structural methods to estimate effects in Brazil and developing a quantitative spatial model to assess long-run effects. By exploring the intersections of climate and development economics, this project seeks to provide critical insights into the economic consequences of forced migration, ultimately informing policies to mitigate its negative impacts and promote sustainable development in affected regions."
