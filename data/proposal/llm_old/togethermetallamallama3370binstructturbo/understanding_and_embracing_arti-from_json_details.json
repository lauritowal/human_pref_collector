        "Title: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families (F-AI-MILY)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for F-AI-MILY, a groundbreaking study investigating the effects of artificial agents on family social dynamics. By integrating insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction, our interdisciplinary approach aims to uncover the intricate dynamics of family interactions with artificial agents. The project's primary objectives include establishing a novel group-centred mobile-lab methodology, describing developmental changes in social dynamics, and identifying ways to leverage artificial agents to support households with chronic illness. Our methods involve developing a mobile lab, measuring behavioral and brain responses, and testing long-term effects of artificial agent interactions on families with children aged 4-12. The ultimate goal of F-AI-MILY is to gain unprecedented insight into family social dynamics and harness this knowledge to transform maladaptive into adaptive dynamics, particularly in families coping with chronic illness. By adopting a \"full circle\" approach, we strive to guide the development of artificial agents that can effectively support vulnerable households, ultimately enhancing the well-being of families."
