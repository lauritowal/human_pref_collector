        "Title: Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability (WEALTHTRAJECT)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking project that investigates the diverse patterns of wealth accumulation over individuals' lifetimes. The primary objectives of WEALTHTRAJECT are to document variability in wealth trajectories, identify key drivers of wealth variability, and establish intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth accumulation. To achieve these goals, the project will collect novel life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories and combine longitudinal data from surveys and registers. \n\nThe proposed research introduces several innovations, including a novel approach emphasizing diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses, and the application of advanced quantitative methods. By focusing on long-term trajectories of wealth accumulation, wealth inequality, and trajectory variability, WEALTHTRAJECT aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors influencing wealth accumulation. As the first project to systematically examine diversity in long-term wealth accumulation trajectories within and between social groups, WEALTHTRAJECT has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, informing policies aimed at reducing wealth inequality and promoting economic mobility."
