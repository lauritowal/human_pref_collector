        "Title: A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a comprehensive online library of Anglo-Saxon poetry, spanning the period of c. 670-1100 CE. The library will feature over 60,000 lines of poetry in Old English and Anglo-Latin, marked up using TEI P5 XML for maximum interoperability and accessibility. The corpus will include works from approximately 50 named poets, as well as a significant amount of anonymous verse, with a focus on documenting the influence of named poets and tracing potential influences in anonymous works. \n\nThe digital library will be accompanied by a range of resources, including sound and image files, and will be supported by a series of conferences, workshops, and publications. The project's geographical scope will be Europe, with a particular emphasis on the coexistence of Latin and vernacular languages in a Christian context. By creating a consolidated and interactive library of Anglo-Saxon poetry, this project aims to provide a valuable resource for scholars and researchers, and to shed new light on the literary and cultural heritage of early medieval Europe."
