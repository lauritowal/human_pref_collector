        "Title: Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project examining the interplay between men's changing family and working lives and their health and cognition. Men experience higher premature mortality rates and significant preventable excess mortality, highlighting a critical need to address gender health disparities. The project aims to improve men's health and cognition, promoting gender equality and enhancing their social contributions through increased family involvement, labor market participation, and societal engagement.\n\nThe study will investigate cohort and period differences, the work-family interface, and the evolving male breadwinner model, with a focus on young adulthood and midlife. Utilizing Norwegian population data, including register, survey, and genetic data, the project will disentangle selection and causality. A large sample size of over 12,000 men, aged from late teens to 36-69, will provide valuable insights into cognitive trajectories and health measures.\n\nBy exploring the complex relationships between men's family and working lives, health, and cognition, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing men's well-being and inform strategies to reduce gender health disparities. The proposed research has the potential to extend men's potential, enhancing their participation in society and promoting healthier, more equitable lives. Funding for this project is currently pending, and support is essential to advance this critical research agenda."
