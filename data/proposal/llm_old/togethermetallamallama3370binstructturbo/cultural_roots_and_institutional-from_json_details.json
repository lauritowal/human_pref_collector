        "This grant proposal, \"Cultural roots and institutional transformations of teachers' careers and the teaching profession in Europe,\" seeks to investigate the institutional dimensions influencing teachers' careers and the teaching profession in Europe. The project focuses on educational systems in Belgium, France, and England, addressing issues of low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. Through a systematic comparative approach and post-comparative mixed-method design, this study aims to explain the nature of teacher policy, understand changes in the teaching profession's status, analyze teacher allocation, and model teacher attrition and migration. By combining policy analysis, secondary data analysis, qualitative studies, and multilevel multi-group analyses, this project will provide new theoretical knowledge and a reconceptualization of institutional change. The expected outcomes will inform strategies to enhance the attractiveness and stability of the teaching profession, ultimately benefiting educational systems and societies in Europe."
