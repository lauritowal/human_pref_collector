        "Title: The Multisensory Mind: From Neural Mechanisms to Cognition\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research program investigating multisensory integration (MI), a crucial aspect of human perception. The project aims to examine neural and neurochemical markers of MI and test a novel hypothesis regarding synchronized neural populations. Using a combination of human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we will study both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. The objectives of this research are to advance our understanding of multisensory integration and explore its applications in the treatment of conditions characterized by impaired MI. By uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying MI, this project has the potential to improve our comprehension of perceptual processes and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for individuals with multisensory integration deficits. The proposed research program will provide valuable insights into the complex relationships between sensory inputs and coherent multisensory percepts, ultimately enhancing our knowledge of the multisensory mind."
