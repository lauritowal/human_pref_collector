        "Title: Long-Term Investment\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Long-Term Investment,\" seeks to explore the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through a comprehensive, three-component study. The project acknowledges the shift in firm characteristics from capital-intensive and cost-efficient in the 20th century to competing on product quality and relying on intangible assets, such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture, in the 21st century. \n\nThe study will examine the challenges of investing in intangible assets, which may take years to yield results, amidst managerial pressure to maximize short-term earnings. The three linked components of the project are: (1) Financial Markets, focusing on how information about future investment opportunities is incorporated into stock prices; (2) Incentives, investigating the optimal horizon of incentives and their effect on long-term decisions; and (3) Effects of Investment, aiming to demonstrate the benefits of corporate social responsibility and its linkage to firm value. \n\nBy exploring these critical aspects, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the intricacies of long-term investment, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of what drives firms to prioritize long-term success over short-term gains. The expected outcomes will inform strategies to encourage sustainable investment practices, benefiting both businesses and the broader economy."
