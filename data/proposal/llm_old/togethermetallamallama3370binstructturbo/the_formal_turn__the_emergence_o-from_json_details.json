        "Title: The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary and comparative study of the emergence of formalism in twentieth-century thought, focusing on the philosophy of science and logic. The project, \"The Formal Turn,\" will investigate the early contributions to formalism during the first half of the twentieth century. The study is divided into three subprojects: historical reconstruction, comparative study, and analysis of philosophical implications.\n\nThe historical reconstruction subproject will examine the roots of formalism in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology, with a focus on key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The comparative study subproject will explore the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism, highlighting the work of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The final subproject will analyze the philosophical implications of formalism, including semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of formalism and its significance in shaping twentieth-century thought."
