        "Title: Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators\n\nThis Proof of Concept grant proposal, submitted to the European Research Council (ERC), aims to develop a innovative software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring economic indicators. Building upon the foundations laid by our previous ERC grant (ERC-2007-StG, \"Change-Point Tests\"), this project seeks to introduce significant improvements over current software by incorporating real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. Our approach will utilize a novel model family, leverage high-frequency information, and enable real-time forecast monitoring and predictive breakdown tests.\n\nThe proposed toolbox is designed to be user-friendly, featuring a three-dimensional graphical representation, and will be made accessible to key decision makers. Our initial collaborations with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank are already established, ensuring a strong foundation for the project's success. The ultimate objective is to improve economic forecasts and decision making, contributing to prudent economic policy, economic growth, and enhanced economic and social welfare. By developing this cutting-edge software, we aim to provide governments, Central Banks, and firms with a powerful tool to inform their economic decisions and drive positive change."
