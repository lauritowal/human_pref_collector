        "Title: Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive historical study examining the experiences of boat refugees worldwide since the 1940s. The project will investigate how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary have shaped the journeys and receptions of boat refugees across different time periods and geographical locations. Focusing on the Mediterranean, South China Sea, Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Aden, the research will analyze the complex interactions between boat refugees, non-state actors, and states.\n\nKey research points include solidarity among boat refugees, encounters with non-state actors, state responses to boat refugees at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary after the journey. By adopting a comparative approach across time and space, this project will go beyond state-centric perspectives, exploring the role of non-state actors and the significance of sea routes in shaping the history of boat refugees.\n\nUsing a diverse range of sources, including interviews with boat refugees and non-state actors, oral history, state archives, and contemporary media coverage, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the historical patterns and trends that have influenced the experiences of boat refugees. The expected outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding boat refugees and inform more effective policies and practices for addressing the needs of these vulnerable populations."
