        "Title: MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE (MEGAMAPS)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a transnational, in-depth study on artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, focusing on the post-2011 period. The project, MEGAMAPS, aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region by investigating the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining history, social movements theory, gender studies, visual arts, and digital humanities, the project will frame, explore, and map emerging artivism for gender equality in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia.\n\nThe study will employ fieldwork and digital ethnography methods, utilizing living sources such as visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools. A key output will be an open-access, participative digital platform documenting and systematizing these living sources, making them FAIRly accessible to academics, stakeholders, and the general public. The project's dissemination activities aim to promote mutual exchanges of best practices, contribute to reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities, and propose an agency paradigm to overcome orientalism and Islamophobia. By providing a groundbreaking research platform for artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region, MEGAMAPS will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between art, activism, and social transformation."
