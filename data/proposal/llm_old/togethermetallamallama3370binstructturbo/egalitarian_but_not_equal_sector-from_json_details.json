        "Title: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\n\nAbstract:\nThe proposed project, WAGE, aims to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining and its impact on sectoral wage differentials. Despite efforts to promote equality, a significant gender pay gap persists, with a global average of 20% and 13% in Europe. This project will investigate the metal and nursing sectors in Germany, Norway, and Sweden, using ethnographic research to uncover the daily practices and negotiations that influence wage formation. The research objectives are threefold: (1) to compare and synthesise the histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap in the selected countries, (2) to analyse the collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector, and (3) to document how actors in these sectors relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. By exploring the gendered nature of collective bargaining, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the persistent gender pay gap, ultimately informing policies to promote greater equality in the labour market."
