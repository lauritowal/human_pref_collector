        "Title: From Warfare to Welfare: A Comparative Study of Combat Trauma Internalization and Institutionalization\n\nThis anthropological study proposes a comparative analysis of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Focusing on the military and psychiatric institutions, the project will utilize ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis to develop a framework for understanding the shaping of combat trauma. The aims are to shed light on conflicting values, analyze perceptions of ethnicity, and identify key problems in veteran care. The expected outcomes include advancing studies in biopolitics and medicalization, impacting policy and healthcare, and deepening understanding of war-related suffering internalization. The project targets veterans and clinicians, seeking to address the significance of combat trauma institutionalization, veterans' experiences with ethnicity, and resistance to clinical illness models. By examining the intersection of biopolitics, medicalization, and combat trauma, this research aims to inform and improve care and policy for veterans, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the complex issues surrounding war-related trauma."
