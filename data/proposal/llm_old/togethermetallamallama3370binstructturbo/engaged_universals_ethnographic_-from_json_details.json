        "Title: Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of Universal Health Coverage and the Public Good in Africa\n\nThis anthropological study proposes to investigate the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Africa, with a focus on its interpretation and implementation in three African countries. UHC, defined as ensuring access to essential health services without financial hardship, is a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, its pursuit in Africa is complicated by historical issues such as structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, and privatization, which have led to a burden of payment on the poor and neglect of national health-care systems.\n\nThrough a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, this project will examine the relationships between states and citizens, formal systems of social protection, and informal social networks supporting health. It will also consider national histories and social practices that shape the implementation of UHC. The study aims to contribute to new research directions and provide knowledge relevant beyond Africa, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities of achieving UHC in resource-constrained settings. By exploring the complexities of UHC in Africa, this project seeks to inform policy and practice, ultimately promoting more equitable and effective health systems."
