        "Title: Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a pioneering approach to understanding the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' culture, with a focus on its role in shaping identity formation and initiation into adulthood. The project addresses the limitations of current research by moving beyond a selective focus on Western culture and instead applying regional perspectives to comparative studies across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. An international team of scholars will conduct a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyze crucial reception cases, and develop materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations and a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture. The project aims to contribute to integration and stimulate cultural exchange, ultimately enriching our understanding of the influence of popular culture on Classical Antiquity and its relevance in today's globalized world."
