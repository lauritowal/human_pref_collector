        "Title: Metacognition of Concepts (MetCogCon)\n\nThis grant proposal, Metacognition of Concepts (MetCogCon), seeks to investigate the metacognitive processes underlying the use of concepts, such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES. Despite the crucial role of concepts in human cognition, the thoughts and feelings that accompany their use are poorly understood, lacking a clear theoretical framework. The proposed project aims to address this knowledge gap by combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, employing psychological model-building, and conducting experimental investigations.\n\nThe project's objective is to examine how metacognition influences the decision to rely on, reject, or embrace concepts, affecting their selection for reasoning and induction, and impacting cognitive processes competing for action control. The expected outcomes of MetCogCon include an enhanced understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind, improved understanding of cognitive control, and addressing long-standing philosophical problems.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are significant, with applications in informing reasoning policies in everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and determining the reliability of heuristics in concept selection. By exploring the metacognition of concepts, MetCogCon aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of human cognition, ultimately improving our ability to think, reason, and make informed decisions."
