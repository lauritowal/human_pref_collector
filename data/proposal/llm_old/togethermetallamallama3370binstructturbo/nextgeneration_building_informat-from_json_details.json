        "Title: NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that integrates form, function, and use information to better evaluate the impact of built environments on human behavior. Current building information modeling (BIM) tools are limited by their focus on physical and material characteristics, neglecting the context, intended use, and user considerations. These limitations hinder the ability to predict a building's effect on future users' lives and activities, and to assess whether a building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nThe proposed research aims to address these limitations by developing a next-generation BIM system that includes user behavior and context. This innovative approach will enable better-designed buildings that enhance the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment. The recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth underscores the importance of this research. By supporting the development of advanced BIM systems, this project will contribute to creating buildings that promote occupant well-being, productivity, and sustainability. The expected outcomes of this research will have far-reaching benefits, ultimately leading to improved building design and a better quality of life for users."
