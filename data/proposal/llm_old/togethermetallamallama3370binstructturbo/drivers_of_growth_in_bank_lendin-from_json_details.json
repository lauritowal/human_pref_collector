        "Title: Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the underlying factors contributing to strong credit growth and its subsequent impact on banking crises. Despite the consensus that tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension can mitigate negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector, decisive empirical evidence is lacking. The proposed project aims to address this knowledge gap by empirically identifying the individual ingredients that drive credit growth, including financial innovations, loan securitization, and mortgage lending booms.\n\nUsing exceptional micro-level datasets and appropriate methodologies, this study will estimate the impact of each factor on loan growth, assessing potential combinations of ingredients and their interactions. The project's objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of credit growth, ensuring external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies. By shedding light on the complex relationships between these factors, this research will contribute to the development of more effective regulatory policies, ultimately enhancing the stability of the global banking system."
