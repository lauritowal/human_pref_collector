        "Title: Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training,\" aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying stress resilience and sensitivity. Our objective is to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale neural network shifts during acute stress and recovery, identifying transdiagnostic biomarkers that predict stress resilience. We hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale networks, impacting higher-order cognition. \n\nUsing a multi-modal approach, including network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback, we will examine the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts and test the disruption of cognitive functions by shifting network balance. Our goal is to develop an fMRI neurofeedback method for training adaptive reallocation of neural resources, promoting stress resilience. This project will provide valuable insights into brain adaptation to acute stress, ultimately leading to the development of a novel framework for understanding and training stress resilience. The proposed research has the potential to identify neural markers of stress resilience and sensitivity, informing the creation of targeted interventions for individuals with high stress sensitivity."
