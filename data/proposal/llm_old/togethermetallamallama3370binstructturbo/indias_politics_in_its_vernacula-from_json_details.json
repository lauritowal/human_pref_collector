        "Title: India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multidisciplinary research project that explores the conceptual foundations of India's political life, focusing on the ideas guiding ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement. Despite India's status as the world's largest democracy and a rising power, little is known about the vernacular languages and ideas that shape its political landscape. Our project will employ an ethnographic and historical approach, collaborating with anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics to examine India's demotic political ideas through its vernacular languages. The objectives include developing a vernacular lexicography of India's political life, creating an online Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, and exploring implications for global political theory. Inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, this project aims to lay groundwork for the study of subcontinental politics, provide methodological insights beyond Europe, and advance global political theory. The expected outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of India's political life and have broader implications for the study of politics globally."
