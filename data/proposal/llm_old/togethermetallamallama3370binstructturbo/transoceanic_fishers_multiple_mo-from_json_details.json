        "Title: Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple Mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to challenge prevailing assumptions about fishers as mere instruments of state agendas by exploring the complex, transoceanic movements of fishers in and out of the South China Sea. Focusing on the shift in fishing practices, transoceanic expansion, and fisher movements, our project will employ a novel theoretical and methodological framework, incorporating radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and relational and shifting multiple mobilities. Through fine-grained ethnography, we will study Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, examining their intersections as fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers. Our research will shed light on the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood and its implications. With significant scientific and policy value, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the transoceanic fishers' world, ultimately informing more effective management and conservation strategies for the world's oceans. By analyzing shore-based key nodal points and the complex networks of fishers, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the human dimension of marine resource exploitation."
