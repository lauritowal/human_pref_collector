        "Title: The Design, Creation and Survival of Democratic Laws (DEMOLAW)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the DEMOLAW project, a comprehensive study on the design, creation, and long-term survival of democratic legislation. The project aims to analyze legislative texts in the US, UK, and EU, utilizing cutting-edge computational methods to address three major research questions. These questions focus on capturing the conceptual dimensions of law design, explaining variations in democratic legislation, and understanding the stability or change in laws over time. \n\nThe DEMOLAW project will contribute to the field by introducing a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design, developing an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival, and advancing methodological approaches for computational analysis of legislative content. The project will examine legislative texts across multiple dimensions, including versatility and precision. By investigating the design, creation, and survival of democratic laws in different political systems, this project will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of legislation and inform policy-making processes. The expected outcomes of this project will enhance our understanding of democratic legislation and contribute to the development of more effective and efficient legal frameworks."
