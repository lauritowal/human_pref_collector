        "Title: Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges\n\nThis grant proposal, \"REPAIR,\" seeks to investigate the emerging calls for reparations in global development contexts, examining their role in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. The project aims to compare how reparations payments are established, implemented, and received, providing insights into their economic, moral, and political implications. By exploring the type of wealth transfer reparations constitute, this study will shed light on the \"reparative aspects\" of economic life.\n\nAs the first comparative social-science study of reparations in development, REPAIR will broaden the existing framework of reparations research and introduce novel theoretical and methodological approaches from economic anthropology. This innovative project will contribute significantly to our understanding of reparations as a form of wealth transfer, filling a critical knowledge gap in the field. The proposed research has the potential to inform policy and practice, ultimately enhancing our ability to address global development challenges through reparative measures."
