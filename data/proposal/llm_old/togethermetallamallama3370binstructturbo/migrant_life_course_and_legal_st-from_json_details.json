        "Title: Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project investigating the impact of citizenship on migrant integration, with a focus on the timing and policy variations influencing legal status transitions and integration outcomes. The project aims to model migrants' legal status transitions as life course events and analyze the relevance of citizenship for various aspects of integration, including work and income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment. Using longitudinal register-based micro-data and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries, the project will develop and test methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact. The target population includes immigrants and their children. The ultimate goal is to inform targeted citizenship policies that maximize settlement success, contributing to more effective migrant integration strategies. By exploring the complex relationships between legal status transitions, policy variations, and integration outcomes, this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to promote successful migrant settlement."
