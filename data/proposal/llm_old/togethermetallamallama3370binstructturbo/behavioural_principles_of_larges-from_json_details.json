        "Title: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation (PRINCIPLES)\n\nAbstract:\nThe proposed project, PRINCIPLES, aims to develop a unified science of human cooperation by investigating the behavioural principles underlying large-scale cooperation. Current models focus on narrow aspects, neglecting the complexity of real-world problems like global warming and Covid-19. PRINCIPLES will adopt an integrated research approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology. The project objectives include developing a comprehensive model of cooperation, experimentally testing behavioural principles, and analyzing models of social dilemmas. By using incentivized experiments in representative samples, PRINCIPLES will provide a novel framework for understanding cooperation in large-scale problems, with a focus on rule-following as a key concept. The project's target problems include climate care, and its findings will be tailored for researchers and policy makers across disciplines. Ultimately, PRINCIPLES will equip stakeholders with behavioural principles, tools, and data to address pressing cooperation problems, promoting collective action in the face of global challenges."
