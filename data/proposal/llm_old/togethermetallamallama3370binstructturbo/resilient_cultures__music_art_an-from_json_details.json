        "Title: Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Resilient Cultures,\" explores the intersection of cultural production and social critique in mainland China and Hong Kong. By examining popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, our research investigates how these fields express social and political discontent, and develop resilient tactics to navigate authoritarianism and platformization. A comparative analysis of indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui will provide insights into the complexities of cultural critique. Using a mixed-methods approach combining ethnography, textual analysis, and digital methods, we aim to foster a collaborative research network spanning East Asia, Europe, and beyond. Our expected outcomes include promoting multivocality, diversity, and vitality in cultural production. By situating our research within a broader comparative context, including Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, we seek to contribute to a deeper understanding of the global dynamics of cultural resilience. Ultimately, this project will showcase the innovative strategies employed by cultural practitioners to challenge dominant narratives and foster social change."
