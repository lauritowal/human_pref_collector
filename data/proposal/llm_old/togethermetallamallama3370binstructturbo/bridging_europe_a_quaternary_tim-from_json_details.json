        "Title: Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a precise Quaternary timescale for understanding human expansion and evolution in Europe over the last 2.6 million years. The project focuses on overcoming the limitations of radiocarbon dating (~60,000 years) by utilizing paired dating methods, including amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating, on calcitic fossils and snail opercula. The research aims to refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change, including climatic oscillations, ice sheet expansion, and sea-level changes. By addressing critical questions about the timing of early human expansion into Europe, climatic conditions during this period, and differences in tool technologies, this project will provide a breakthrough in our ability to understand human history. The pan-European chronology developed by this research will cover the entire Palaeolithic in Eurasia, with a focus on regions such as Britain and the Black Sea, ultimately shedding new light on human evolution, migration, and adaptation to environmental change."
