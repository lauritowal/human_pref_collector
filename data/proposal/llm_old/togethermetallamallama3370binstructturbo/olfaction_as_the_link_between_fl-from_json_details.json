        "Title: Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption (OLFLINK)\n\nAbstract:\nThe OLFLINK project aims to transform human diets for global health and sustainability by overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors. This grant proposal seeks to investigate the cortical processes of appetitive property transfer from odor to taste, a critical knowledge gap in understanding flavor preference formation. The project will explore three key objectives: determining the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (CODE), delineating the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations (CONTROL), and determining interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (REGULATE). By examining these processes across three nested levels of investigation, OLFLINK will uncover the complex relationships between olfactory perception, flavor preference, and digestive signals. The expected outcomes include the development of novel interventions for dietary changes, a deeper understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a paradigm shift in our understanding of flavor preference formation and retrieval, enabling more effective strategies for promoting healthy and sustainable diets."
