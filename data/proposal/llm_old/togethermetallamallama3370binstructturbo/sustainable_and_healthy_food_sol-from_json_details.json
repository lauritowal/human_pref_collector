        "This grant proposal, titled \"Sustainable and healthy food solutions: system dynamics and trade-offs\" (FLORA project), aims to contribute to a global transformation of agri-food production, trade, and consumption. The project seeks to create essential evidence for identifying and implementing practice and behavior shifts. By adopting a systemic approach, it will diagnose global food systems' integrated health and environmental outcomes, identify key threats and opportunities, and evaluate tailored solutions using an interdisciplinary modelling framework. The FLORA project will focus on sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption, with a global scope. Its innovative and interdisciplinary approach will enable the identification of effective, targeted solutions, considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics."
