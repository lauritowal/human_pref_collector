        "Title: The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the influence of the international right to housing on national legal discourse, focusing on eviction litigation cases in Europe between 2007 and 2011, which affected approximately 700,000 people. The project will utilize data science techniques, including citation network analysis and machine learning, to analyze legal big data from national supreme courts and lower-level courts. The objective is to conduct an empirical analysis of the interaction between national and international law, identifying predictors of court decisions and conceptualizing the right to housing as a network of international rights. By applying a data-driven approach, this research aims to provide novel insights into the impact of international human rights on national legal systems. The potential outcomes of this project include the identification of predictors of court decisions and the development of a framework for future research applications in other areas of the law. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between international and national law, informing policy and practice in the field of housing rights."
