        "Title: Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind\n\nThis grant proposal aims to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate relationships between brain function and mental processes. Situated within the field of Cognitive Neuroscience, our project seeks to achieve four primary objectives: elucidate the nature of mental processes, determine how these processes emerge from neural machinery, identify the basis of impairments in neurological patients, and enhance clinical management and treatment of these patients.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining experimental psychology, behavioural neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies. Our main activities will focus on converging methods and developing novel neurocomputational models that can mimic both normal and impaired behaviour, while connecting neuroanatomy and cognition. By securing systematic methods for bridging cognitive science and systems neuroscience, we aim to provide a novel formalism for understanding the complex interplay between brain and mind. Ultimately, this project will contribute significantly to the development of more effective treatments for neurological patients and advance our understanding of the human brain."
