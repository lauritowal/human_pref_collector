        "Title: Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC)\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the POLEMIC project, a comprehensive investigation into the role of emotions in politics. The project aims to address three key research questions: whether emotional appeals influence citizens' political choices, if politicians are making more emotional appeals than in the past, and the reasons behind this trend. POLEMIC will analyze political discourse in nine countries from 1945 to the present, bridging the fields of party politics and political psychology. The study will test three theories - vote-maximizing strategy, politician personality, and fashionable trend - using innovative methods, including automated text analysis and physiological measurement. By adopting both macro and micro perspectives, the project will explore the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. The expected outcomes of POLEMIC will extend existing theory and provide novel insights into the persuasive power of emotional appeals, shedding light on the complex interplay between emotions, politics, and citizen engagement."
