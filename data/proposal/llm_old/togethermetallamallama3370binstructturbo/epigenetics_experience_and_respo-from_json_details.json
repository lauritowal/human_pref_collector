        "Title: Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for Neurodevelopmental Disorders\n\nThis grant proposal, NEUROEPIGENETHICS, seeks to investigate the ethical implications of epigenetics on neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project will focus on the interplay between epigenetics, social and physical environments, and their influence on the development of these disorders. By exploring the conceptual changes in our understanding of innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, and biological/psychosocial factors, this study aims to shed light on the ethical dimensions of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility. Using a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, NEUROEPIGENETHICS will engage with persons with neurodevelopmental disorders, their families, and relevant stakeholders to inform its inquiry. The ultimate goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility, with significant implications for the care and support of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders."
