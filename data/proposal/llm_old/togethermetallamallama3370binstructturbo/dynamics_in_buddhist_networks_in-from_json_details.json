        "Title: Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish a novel framework for understanding the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia, with a focus on Buddhism from the 6th to the 14th centuries. By adopting a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, our project will reconstruct the Buddhist network in this region, analyzing the complex, multi-layered relationships between Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan cultures. \n\nOur interdisciplinary approach combines philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies to investigate Buddhist localisations in Eastern Central Asia. The unique perspective of this project lies in its analysis of religious exchange as a dynamic network in both spatial and temporal aspects. By integrating Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into comparative religious studies, this project aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of the region's cultural and religious heritage. The expected outcomes will provide new insights! into the dynamics of Buddhist networks and their impact on the cultural landscape of Eastern Central Asia."
