        "Title: Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of funding frictions on financing conditions for various entities, including countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies, in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 market turmoil. The project focuses on understanding funding frictions, optimizing policy responses, and reducing funding risk for institutions. It examines how market developments, such as ballooning deficits, tighter regulations, and pension risk transfers, have affected funding costs, credit market access, and default risk. The research aims to provide insights on debt management strategies for sovereigns, policy maker awareness of regulatory consequences, and guidance on reducing funding risk. By exploring these critical issues, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of funding frictions and inform policy decisions to mitigate their effects, ultimately promoting more stable and resilient financial markets. The expected outcomes will have significant implications for entities affected by funding frictions, enabling them to better navigate complex financing conditions and make informed decisions."
