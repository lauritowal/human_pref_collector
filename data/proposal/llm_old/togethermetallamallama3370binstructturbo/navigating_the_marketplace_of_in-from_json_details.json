        "Title: Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the complex landscape of country performance indicators (CPIs) across multiple policy fields, including education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. The abundance of CPIs, while intended to simplify evaluation and decision-making, paradoxically multiplies complexity when considered collectively. Our research seeks to address the knowledge gap in navigating policy fields with numerous CPIs, exploring how both users and producers adapt over time.\n\nInspired by the concept of a \"marketplace of ideas,\" our study will employ a systemic, longitudinal analysis to examine how CPI users learn from criticism and make decisions amidst diverse indicators. We will also investigate the competitive dynamics among CPI producers within crowded policy fields. By shifting the focus from individual CPIs to their collective impact, our research aims to advance the field of CPI research systematically. The proposed project will provide valuable insights into the intricacies of CPI navigation, ultimately informing more effective decision-making and policy development in various fields."
