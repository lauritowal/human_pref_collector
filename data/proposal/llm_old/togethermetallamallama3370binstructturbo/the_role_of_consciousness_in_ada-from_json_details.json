        "Title: Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) - Unveiling the Functional Role of Consciousness in Adaptive Behavior\n\nThis grant proposal, \"The role of consciousness in adaptive behavior: A combined empirical, computational and robot-based approach,\" aims to investigate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior. The CDAC project seeks to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action by identifying neuronal principles of consciousness and constructing a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture. Our hypothesis is that a shift to an intentional agent-dominated world requires different control architectures, specifically parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation and a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene. \n\nThe project's expected outcomes include a framework advancing beyond the state of the art, system-level models of conscious architecture, and empirical validation with both humanoid robots and stroke patients. By addressing questions on the function and genesis of consciousness, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the mind and brain, provide new neurorehabilitation technologies, and pave the way for a new generation of robots with advanced social competence. Ultimately, the CDAC project will significantly advance our knowledge of consciousness and its role in adaptive behavior, with far-reaching implications for fields such as neuroscience, robotics, and neurorehabilitation."
