        "Title: Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive investigation into new ways to read the Latin Aristotle, focusing on textual variance in hundreds of handwritten books preserving 12th- and 13th-century translations. The project will concentrate on critical editions of key treatises, including De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. By documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses, this research aims to uncover the importance of textual fluidity in manuscripts, shedding light on how readers interacted with recently available translations that differed from the Greek originals.\n\nThe study will have a significant impact on the fields of philosophy, science, and theology, particularly in the late medieval and early modern periods. The proposed research method, which involves analyzing manuscript witnesses, will develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science. By exploring the dynamic nature of these translations, this project will provide new insights into the transmission and reception of Aristotelian thought, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the intellectual history of the medieval and early modern periods."
