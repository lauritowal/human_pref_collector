        "Title: Non-elected politics. Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe crisis of representative democracy in Europe, marked by growing citizen disengagement, historically low electoral turnout, and declining trust in institutions, has sparked debates on potential solutions. This project investigates the effects of delegating decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts, a phenomenon known as non-elected politics. Despite its growing popularity as a means of reviving democracy, non-elected politics poses a paradox: it contradicts the fundamental principle of elected control in representative democracies.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a detailed study of European preferences for democratic functions and reforms, compile a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and analyze the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy using online survey experiments and panel surveys.\n\nThis research has far-reaching societal implications, as it will provide policymakers with a nuanced understanding of the potential effects of non-elected politics on the legitimacy and effectiveness of representative democracy. By exploring the complex relationships between non-elected politics and democratic support, this project aims to contribute to the development of evidence-based institutional reforms for democracy revitalization in Europe."
