        "Title: Intergroup Toleration: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs societies become increasingly diverse, the need to understand the dynamics of intergroup toleration has never been more pressing. Despite its significance, systematic empirical research on this topic remains scarce. This proposed project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by advancing the state of the art in social sciences, particularly in the realm of social psychology.\n\nThrough a multi-method approach combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, this study will investigate the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the psychological processes that drive it, its limits, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. The expected outcome of this research is to provide groundbreaking insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society.\n\nBy addressing the pressing question of how to live harmoniously in diverse societies, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of intergroup relations and inform strategies for promoting social cohesion. The findings will be highly relevant to policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to foster more inclusive and tolerant communities."
