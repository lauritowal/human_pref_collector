        "Title: The Formal Turn: Unveiling the Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project, \"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought,\" situated at the intersection of the philosophy of science and logic. The project aims to investigate the early contributions to formalism in the first half of the twentieth century through an in-depth, comparative analysis of its historical, logical, and philosophical dimensions.\n\nThe project consists of three interrelated subprojects. The first, \"Historical Reconstruction,\" delves into the roots of formalism in nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology (1860-1910), focusing on key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The second, \"Comparative Study,\" examines the formal turn in logic and its relation to logical empiricism (1920-1940), centering on the contributions of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick.\n\nThe third subproject, \"Analysis of Philosophical Implications,\" explores the far-reaching consequences of formalism on various philosophical topics, including semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. By integrating historical, analytical, and comparative methodologies, this project will shed new light on the emergence of formalism and its profound impact on twentieth-century thought, providing a richer understanding of the intricate relationships between logic, philosophy, and science."
