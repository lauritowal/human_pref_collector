        "Title: Biomarkers of individual differences in human cortical visual processing\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking study that aims to unravel the complex relationship between physiology, personality traits, and cortical visual processing in humans. By combining cutting-edge techniques such as ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the visual cortex, pupil responses, and psychophysics, our research will investigate how normally sighted individuals, including young children, perceive the world differently. We predict that behavioral and cortical properties will co-vary with personality traits, shedding new light on the neural mechanisms underlying human vision.\n\nOur innovative approach will involve the use of physiological interventions, including ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, to modulate visual processing and identify reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception. This research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and inform therapeutic approaches that target general physiology.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this study include the discovery of new biomarkers and evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic changes. By bridging the knowledge gap in our understanding of human vision, our research will provide new insights into the intricate relationship between brain, body, and perception, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for visual processing disorders."
