        "Title: How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the complex relationship between nationalism and electoral polarization in advanced democracies, challenging the conventional view of a transnational cleavage based on cultural conflict. By adopting a multi-method comparative research design, this study will examine the diverse forms of nationalism and their impact on public opinion, partisan divisions, and elite mobilization efforts.\n\nThe project consists of three complementary work packages. The first package will analyze novel survey data to explore how public conceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions, utilizing open-ended survey questions to capture nuanced attitudes. The second package will investigate elite mobilization efforts based on different varieties of nationalism, shedding light on the strategic deployment of national identity in electoral politics. The third package will assess the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility, providing insights into the mechanisms driving polarization.\n\nThis research aims to contribute to academic advancements in the field of nationalism and electoral politics, as well as enrich public debate on the societal challenges posed by rising nationalism. By providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between nationalism, public opinion, and partisan divisions, this project seeks to inform policymakers and citizens alike, ultimately promoting a more inclusive and cohesive public discourse."
