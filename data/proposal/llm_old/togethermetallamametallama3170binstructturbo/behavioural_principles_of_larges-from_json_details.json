        "Title: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation (PRINCIPLES)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, PRINCIPLES, seeks to develop a unified science of human cooperation to address pressing global challenges such as climate change and public health crises. Current models of cooperation often focus on narrow aspects, neglecting the complexity of real-world problems. PRINCIPLES will adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology.\n\nThis project aims to develop a comprehensive model of cooperation, experimentally test key behavioural principles, and investigate the links between these principles. By analyzing models of social dilemmas and explaining behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems, PRINCIPLES will provide researchers and policymakers with a novel framework to study cooperation problems.\n\nUsing incentivized experiments in representative samples, this project will equip stakeholders with behavioural principles, tools, and data to tackle pressing global challenges, such as climate care. The expected outcomes of PRINCIPLES include a deeper understanding of the rule-following mechanisms underlying human cooperation and the development of evidence-based policies to promote collective action. By advancing our knowledge of human cooperation, PRINCIPLES will contribute to the development of more effective solutions to global problems."
