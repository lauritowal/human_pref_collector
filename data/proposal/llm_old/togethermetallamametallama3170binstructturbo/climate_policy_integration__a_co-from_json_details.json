        "Title: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe European Union's projected failure to meet its 2050 net-zero target underscores the pressing need to understand and address the complexities hindering effective climate policy integration. This project proposes a novel theoretical framework to explain the persistence of poorly coordinated policy regimes, despite growing policy efforts. By combining quantitative modeling, network analysis, and process tracing, we will uncover patterns of policy (dis)integration, temporal dynamics, and system-level solutions in the EU and selected member states.\n\nOur comparative analysis will focus on coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration, identifying best practices and challenges. The project's expected outcomes include actionable insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, as well as broader implications for policy design and governance in complex systems. With the researcher's expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, this project aims to advance the debate beyond climate policy, contributing to a deeper understanding of policy integration and its challenges."
