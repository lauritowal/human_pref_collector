        "Title: What are the Origins of Empathy? A Comparative Developmental Investigation\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis innovative, interdisciplinary project seeks to investigate the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy through a comparative study of humans and bonobos. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, our research team will conduct longitudinal observations and experiments in diverse contexts, including humans from Vanuatu and Samoa, and bonobos in both wild and semi-captive settings.\n\nOur research aims to challenge prevailing perspectives on human uniqueness in empathy by exploring the role of distributed-caregiving societal structures in shaping empathetic capacities. We hypothesize that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but that humans diverge in their motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states, and possess a unique capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange.\n\nThis project integrates insights from biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology to advance our understanding of empathy's origins. The potential outcomes of this research include a deeper understanding of the evolutionary roots of human-unique sharing and cooperation, and significant contributions to the development of more effective interventions for promoting empathy and cooperation in human societies."
