        "Title: Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis transnational research project, led by a principal investigator and a team of multiple researchers, seeks to recover the connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Focusing on the period between 1500 and 1750, this project will examine the experiences of Eastern Christians who migrated from the Ottoman Empire to various regions, including Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. By analyzing source materials from dozens of archives across three continents and written in ten languages, the research team will employ a rigorous methodological core of philology and source criticism to uncover the everyday lives of these migrants.\n\nThe project's analytical frame is rooted in global and connected histories, aiming to overcome the conceptual challenge of linking micro-scale experiences to macro-narratives in global history. Expected outcomes include print publications, workshops, and the development of a searchable database. The project will contribute to a deeper understanding of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, shedding new light on the stories of survival and adaptation of Eastern Christians in the early modern world. By adopting a transnational approach, this project will provide a nuanced and multifaceted perspective on the complexities of global migration and the interconnectedness of cultures in the early modern era."
