        "Title: The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed ethnographic project, \"The Upcycled Clinic,\" aims to investigate the creative repurposing of materials in healthcare settings worldwide, addressing the pressing issue of wastefulness in medicine. Through a globally oriented study of improvisation in the clinic, our research will explore the conditions that facilitate creative material engagement among healthcare professionals, including ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff.\n\nConducted across five sub-projects in diverse locations (Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, U.S., and U.K.), our study will employ a mixed-methods approach combining fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets. By moving beyond the traditional patient encounter focus in hospital ethnographies, this research will contribute to the advancement of theories of materiality, resilience, and innovation in the workplace.\n\nThe practical outcomes of this project will inform the development of local solutionsconds to address wastefulness and shortages in healthcare settings, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of medical practices. By articulating the conditions for healthcare creativity, our research will provide a framework for promoting resourceful and effective healthcare delivery worldwide."
