        "Title: Good Attention: Attention Norms and their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics (GOODATTENTION)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe GOODATTENTION project seeks to provide a groundbreaking and interdisciplinary investigation of attention norms, a long-overlooked aspect of human cognition. By integrating insights from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and other fields, this project aims to develop a novel conceptual framework for understanding the emergence and evaluation of attention norms. The primary goal is to create a unified foundation for the study of attention norms, focusing on the hypothesis that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance.\n\nThe project will achieve its objectives through a range of research activities, including investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social relevance in guiding attention, and analyzing the epistemic and ethical implications of attention norms. By integrating attention norms into normative philosophy, the project expects to have a significant impact on various philosophical fields, including practical reason, epistemology, and ethics.\n\nFurthermore, the project's analytical framework will provide policymakers with a valuable tool for decision-making, enabling them to better understand the role of attention norms in shaping individual and collective behavior. Ultimately, the GOODATTENTION project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between attention, cognition, and society, with far-reaching implications for various fields of study and real-world applications."
