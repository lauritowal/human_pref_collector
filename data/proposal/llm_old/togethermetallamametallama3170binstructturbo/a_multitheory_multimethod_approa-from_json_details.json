        "Title: A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn line with the United Nations' Decade of Action (2020-2030), this project proposes a comprehensive approach to address the pressing issue of radicalization leading to violence. The current state of research on this topic is hindered by theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings, including the lack of consensus on the nature and causes of radicalization, limited access to relevant populations, and methodological limitations.\n\nThis project aims to overcome these shortcomings by developing a multi-theory model of radicalization and deradicalization, an innovative methodology for data collection, and conducting comparative studies across 10 countries (Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan). The project consists of four work packages, focusing on model development, methodology, data collection and analysis, and the development of evidence-based prevention and deradicalization programs.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a significant advancement in scientific understanding of radicalization and deradicalization, as well as the development of novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism. By addressing the complex and multifaceted nature of radicalization, this project aims to contribute to the global effort to prevent and reduce radicalization leading to violence, ultimately promoting peace, security, and human well-being."
