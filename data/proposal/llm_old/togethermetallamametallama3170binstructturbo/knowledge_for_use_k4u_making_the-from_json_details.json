        "Title: Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, Knowledge For Use [K4U], aims to revolutionize the application of social science in policy-making by developing a practical approach to policy design and deliberation. Funded by the Horizon 2020 program, K4U seeks to bridge the gap between knowledge production and knowledge use in social science research. By adopting a Popperian philosophical approach, this project will reconceptualize objectivity and deliberation, and explore the role of values in the science-society interface.\n\nCurrent social science research focuses excessively on knowledge production, often neglecting the importance of knowledge use. K4U addresses this issue by developing a balanced approach to policy design, considering effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. The project's outcomes will have a profound impact on policy-making, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions and develop evidence-based policies.\n\nK4U will make significant contributions to the field of social science, introducing a new philosophical approach to policy design and launching the philosophy of social technology field. The project's practical insights will provide policymakers and stakeholders with a valuable tool to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies, ultimately leading to more effective and sustainable social policies."
