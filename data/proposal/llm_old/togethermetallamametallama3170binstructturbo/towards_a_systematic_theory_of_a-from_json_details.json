        "Title: Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry (STARTDIALOG)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry (STARTDIALOG),\" aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams, addressing the current lack of understanding of their logical properties and unappreciated heuristic potential. By creating a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and a comprehensive diagram database, this project seeks to clarify and solve current issues in the field, provide an accurate understanding of the methodological importance of these diagrams, and study them as objects of independent interest.\n\nThe STARTDIALOG project will have a significant impact on logical geometry, with far-reaching implications for philosophical logicians and various disciplines, including philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. The proposed research will break new ground in the field, leading to a deeper understanding of the role of Aristotelian diagrams in logical reasoning and their potential applications. By exploring the properties and applications of these diagrams, this project will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in multiple fields, ultimately enhancing our understanding of logical reasoning and its interdisciplinary connections."
