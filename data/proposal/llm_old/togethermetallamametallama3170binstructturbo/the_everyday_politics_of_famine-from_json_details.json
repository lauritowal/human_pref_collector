        "Title: The Everyday Politics of Famine\n\nAbstract:\n\nFamines are becoming increasingly frequent and deadly, with 250,000 people experiencing famine in 2022 and 35 million people on the edge of disaster. Despite the urgency of the issue, the persistence of famines remains poorly understood. The proposed project, \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring the everyday politics of famine in communities.\n\nThis ethnographically-informed comparative study will be conducted in South Sudan and Somalia, two regions heavily affected by famine. Our research team, composed of Somali and South Sudanese researchers with extensive experience and networks in the field, will employ a multi-stranded approach to examine the complexities of famine politics. We will investigate histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives that enforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics.\n\nOur research goals are fourfold: (1) to understand why famines persist, (2) to contribute to a shift in the science of famine politics, (3) to explore the normalization of new deadly famines, and (4) to examine the displacement of blame for famine suffering. By shedding light on the everyday politics of famine, this project aims to provide new insights and perspectives that can inform more effective famine prevention and response strategies."
