        "Title: Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC) project seeks to investigate the role of emotions in shaping citizens' political choices and politicians' campaign strategies across nine countries from 1945 to the present. This interdisciplinary research endeavor bridges the fields of party politics and political psychology, adopting a dual perspective that examines both what politicians say (macro) and how citizens respond (micro). By testing three competing theories - vote-maximizing strategy, the product of politician's personality, and fashionable trend - POLEMIC aims to explain the increasing prevalence of emotional appeals in politics and their impact on citizens' decision-making processes.\n\nCombining cutting-edge methods, including automated text analysis and physiological measurement, POLEMIC will provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between emotions and politics. The expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. By extending existing theory and employing novel methods, POLEMIC will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the complex relationships between politics, emotions, and persuasion."
