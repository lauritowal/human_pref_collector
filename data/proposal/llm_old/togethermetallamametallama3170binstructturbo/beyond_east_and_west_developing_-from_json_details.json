        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\n\nThis project seeks to bridge the cultural divide in music by integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. Through a series of research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, we will bring together traditional Turkish instrumentalists and singers, as well as Western musicians, to develop new repertoire and explore non-Western vocal techniques.\n\nOur objectives include training traditional and Western musicians in new musical practices, developing ensemble interfaces with newly designed instruments, and producing studies on timbre. We will also create a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems, ultimately establishing a model for transcultural musical practice that can overcome cultural barriers.\n\nThe project's outputs will include an e-book titled 'Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music', an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds, and online audio and visual examples. Published by Cambridge University Press (CUP), these resources will provide a valuable framework for musicians, educators, and researchers seeking to explore the possibilities of transcultural music-making."
