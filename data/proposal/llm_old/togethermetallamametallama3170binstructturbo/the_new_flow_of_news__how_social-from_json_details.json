        "Title: \"The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe rise of social network sites (SNS) has revolutionized the news landscape, transforming the way news is produced, disseminated, and consumed. This project aims to explore the process of news transformation and its implications for citizens' political behavior. By adopting a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, this research seeks to develop a new understanding of the complex relationships between news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees in the SNS era.\n\nUsing a multi-method approach, including big data analysis, in-depth interviews, and laboratory observations, this project will investigate the impact of SNS on news production, news consumption, and citizens' political beliefs and behavior. The study will consist of three main components: an examination of news organizations' adaptations to SNS, an analysis of users' behavior and attention patterns, and a longitudinal assessment of the long-term effects of SNS on citizens' political behavior over a period of two years.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, as well as the establishment of a new methodological standard for audience research. The findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between SNS, news, and politics, ultimately informing strategies for promoting a more informed and engaged citizenry."
