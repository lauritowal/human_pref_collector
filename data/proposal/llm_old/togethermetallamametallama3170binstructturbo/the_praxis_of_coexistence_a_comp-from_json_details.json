        "Title: The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research program that addresses the pressing issue of ethno-religious coexistence through a novel empirical and comparative approach. The project, \"The Praxis of Coexistence,\" focuses on the everyday practices of coexistence in diverse communities across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. By adopting an inductive methodology, this research aims to shed light on the spontaneous ways in which communities accommodate difference and maintain civil relations.\n\nThe project's primary objectives are to understand and map the diverse practices of coexistence, inform policy decisions through empirical study, and illuminate community expectations for coexistence. Specifically, this research seeks to answer two core questions: How do communities accommodate difference spontaneously, and what resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict?\n\nBy exploring the complexities of ordinary coexistence in diverse contexts, this project aims to open up new theoretical and normative spaces for thinking about coexistence, taking into account the cultural and practical nuances of each community. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to the development of more effective policies and practices that support the peaceful coexistence of diverse communities."
