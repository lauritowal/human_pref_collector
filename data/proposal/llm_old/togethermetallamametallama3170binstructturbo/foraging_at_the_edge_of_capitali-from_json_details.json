        "Title: Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism: A Political Ecology of Foraging in the Anthropocene\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the face of the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and the post-2008 financial crisis, foraging has emerged as a globally significant economic strategy and socio-environmental entanglement. Despite its growing relevance, mainstream attention to foraging remains patchy. This interdisciplinary project, grounded in anthropology, seeks to develop a comprehensive political ecology of foraging, situating this practice within the context of the Anthropocene.\n\nThe research team, consisting of five international researchers based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, will investigate diverse foraging examples, including yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US. Through a critical analysis of these cases, the project aims to reveal the complex relationships between foraging, capitalism, and environmental degradation.\n\nOver the course of the project, the research team will produce a range of outputs, including two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition. By shedding light on the intricacies of foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersections between human and non-human worlds in the Anthropocene. Ultimately, the project aims to inform policy and practice, promoting more sustainable and equitable relationships between humans and the environment."
