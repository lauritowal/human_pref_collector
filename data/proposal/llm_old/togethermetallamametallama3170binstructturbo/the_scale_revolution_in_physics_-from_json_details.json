        "Title: The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe RESCALE project seeks to investigate the profound implications of the shift in modern physics towards scale-based theories, which has led to a fundamental transformation in our understanding of the natural world. This interdisciplinary study combines historical and philosophical perspectives to examine the evolution of scale-based theoretical practice in physics since the 1950s and its far-reaching consequences for our understanding of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of the development of scale-based physics and its philosophical interpretations, this project aims to reveal how the ideal of a final theory has influenced modern physics and its implications for our understanding of the world. We will investigate how the shift towards scale-based theories has led to a complex hierarchy of overlapping layers across scales, and how philosophers should adapt their interpretative practice to accommodate this new perspective.\n\nBy exploring the historical and philosophical dimensions of this transformation, the RESCALE project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the epistemological foundations of modern physics and its implications for our understanding of the world. This research has the potential to reveal new insights into the nature of scientific knowledge and its relationship to the world, and to inform future debates in the philosophy of physics."
