        "Title: Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed project, 'Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons,' aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of egalitarian practices and processes across diverse cultural contexts. Through a library-based global comparative study and field ethnographic research, our multidisciplinary team seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical insights to capture the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values.\n\nBy adopting a decentering orientation, our research approach acknowledges and explores the contradictions, limitations, and variations of egalitarian practices, moving beyond traditional notions of equality. We will investigate the cultural significance of egalitarianism, examining its forms and practices in Europe and beyond.\n\nOur research goals include the development of a comparative method that is responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances, and open to diverse conceptions and imaginations of egalitarianism. Key research questions address the role of the state, religion, economic distribution, and scale in shaping egalitarian practices. By exploring these complex dynamics, our project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of egalitarianism as a cultural value, ultimately informing more nuanced and effective strategies for promoting social equality and justice."
