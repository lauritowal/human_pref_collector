        "Title: Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proliferation of country performance indicators (CPIs) in various policy fields has introduced a paradox: while individual CPIs aim to simplify complex issues, collectively they complicate decision-making. The \"Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators\" project addresses the research gap in navigating policy fields with multiple CPIs, such as education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness.\n\nInspired by the \"marketplace of ideas\" framework, this systemic and longitudinal study investigates how CPI users and producers adapt over time to the abundance of indicators. The project focuses on two main aspects: (1) CPI users' learning from criticism and decision-making strategies when confronted with diverse CPIs, and (2) the competitive dynamics among CPI producers within crowded policy fields.\n\nBy examining the interactions between CPI users and producers, this research aims to advance our understanding of the complexities surrounding CPIs and contribute to a systematic problem shift in CPI research. The findings of this project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking to improve the effectiveness and usability of CPIs in informing decision-making processes. Ultimately, this project will help navigate the marketplace of indicators, promoting more informed and sustainable policy choices."
