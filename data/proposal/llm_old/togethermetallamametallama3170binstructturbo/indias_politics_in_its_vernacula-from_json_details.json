        "Title: India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project proposes an ethnographic and historical investigation into the conceptual foundations of India's political life, focusing on the ideas that guide ordinary Indian citizens' engagement with politics. Despite India's status as the world's largest democracy and a Rising Power, its vernacular political languages and concepts have received little scholarly attention. Drawing inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte tradition of inquiry into German political concepts, our project will bring together anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics to develop a vernacular lexicography of India's political life.\n\nThe project has three main objectives: (1) lay empirical and analytical groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of India's demotic political ideas, (2) create an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, and (3) explore the implications of our findings for global political theory in collaboration with European scholars. By examining India's political life through its vernacular languages, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of subcontinental politics, offer methodological insights beyond Europe, and advance global political theory. The project's innovative approach has the potential to reshape the study of politics in India and beyond."
