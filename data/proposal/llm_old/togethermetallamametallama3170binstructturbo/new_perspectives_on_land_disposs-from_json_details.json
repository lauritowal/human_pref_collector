        "Title: New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to investigate the complex relationships between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration in the West African Sahel, with a focus on Mali. By examining the experiences of farmers and pastoralists, the project aims to challenge prevailing narratives around land dispossession and its consequences. Our hypothesis suggests that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, with violent resistance linked to the rise of 'jihadist' groups. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis, we will assess why some smallholders resist violently while others remain compliant. Grounded in the theoretical frameworks of political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, this research will provide novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, as well as new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration. The project's expected outcomes will inform policy formulation, ultimately contributing to more effective and sustainable solutions for addressing the root causes of conflict and migration in the West African Sahel."
