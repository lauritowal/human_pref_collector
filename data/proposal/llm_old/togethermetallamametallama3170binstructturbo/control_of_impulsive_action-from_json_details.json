        "Title: Control of Impulsive Action\n\nAbstract:\n\nImpulsive actions can have devastating consequences for individuals and society, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive these actions remain poorly understood. This project aims to elucidate the complex processes that govern impulsive behavior and develop novel interventions to improve impulse control. \n\nBy combining behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS and EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, we seek to answer a series of critical research questions. These include the origins of novel impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions in impulsive behavior, the impact of learning on impulsivity, the functionality of impulsive actions, and the relationship between state and trait impulsivity.\n\nOur objectives are ambitious, including the development of a new behavioral model of impulsive action, the explanation of impulsivity and control across time and space, and the understanding of individual differences in impulsivity and impulsivity-related disorders. Ultimately, this project aims to replace the currently dominant 'inhibitory control' models of impulsive action with detailed, multifaceted models that can inform the development of novel interventions and treatments. By advancing our understanding of impulse control, this project has the potential to benefit individuals, communities, and society as a whole."
