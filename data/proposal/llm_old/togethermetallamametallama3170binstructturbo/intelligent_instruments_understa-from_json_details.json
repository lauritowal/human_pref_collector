        "Title: Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Intelligent Instruments project seeks to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and musical creativity, examining the profound implications of creative AI on our understanding of art, culture, and society. This interdisciplinary research initiative will develop novel instruments that integrate creative AI, facilitating human-AI collaboration in music and using sonic instruments as scientific tools to investigate the human experience.\n\nThe project's objectives are two-fold: (1) to understand how creative AI alters our relationships with technology and others, and (2) to initiate a public discourse on the role of AI in shaping our future society. By bringing together diverse scientific disciplines, including music, philosophy, computer science, and AI, this research will develop a theoretical framework for reevaluating notions of self, others, and knowledge.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and a reflection of AI's potential impact on future society. The proposed research will also contribute to the development of a theoretical framework for creative AI, initiate a discourse on human-centred AI, and define principles for ethical AI design in products and services. Ultimately, Intelligent Instruments aims to establish a platform for public understanding of AI, using music as a catalyst for exploring the complexities of creative AI and its far-reaching implications for humanity."
