        "Title: Collaborative AI Counters Hate\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proliferation of online hate speech and disinformation poses significant challenges to social cohesion and digital citizenship. The proposed project, Collaborative AI Counters Hate, aims to develop an innovative solution to address AI-assisted extreme speech moderation challenges through a collaborative bottom-up coding approach. Building on the AI4Dignity project model, this initiative seeks to improve AI-assisted speech moderation by addressing the limitations of existing training datasets and the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural contextualization.\n\nOur solution involves the development of a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions, a community-based classification approach, and collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries. The project's key objectives include creating an open-access toolkit, setting procedural benchmarks, operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle, and developing inclusive training datasets. By tackling online hate speech and disinformation, this project will contribute to a safer and more inclusive digital environment, promoting dignity and respect for all individuals. We believe that this collaborative approach will yield more effective and culturally sensitive AI-assisted moderation solutions, ultimately enhancing digital citizenship and social cohesion."
