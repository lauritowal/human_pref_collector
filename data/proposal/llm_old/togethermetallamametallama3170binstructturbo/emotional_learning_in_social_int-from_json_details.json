        "Title: Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed project, \"Emotional Learning in Social Interaction,\" seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying social-emotional learning and its critical role in shaping social behaviors and interactions. The primary objectives of this study are to identify the mechanisms of aversive learning about others, from others through observation, and during interaction, as well as to develop and test a neural model of social-emotional learning.\n\nThe project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The study will examine various factors, including stimulus-bound characteristics (ethnic group belonging, emotional expressiveness), conceptual factors (moral and social status, empathy, and mental state attributions), and social characteristics (described in objectives 1 and 2).\n\nThe predicted neural networks involved in social-emotional learning include affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed networks. Notably, this project proposes the existence of a social-cognitive network for social learning and a fourth network for social learning through interactions and shaping of behavioral norms.\n\nThe outcomes of this study are expected to have significant impacts on our understanding of group conflicts, norm compliance, and social anxiety disorders, such as autism and psychopathy. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying emotional learning in social interaction, this project aims to contribute to the development of novel interventions and treatments for social-emotional learning deficits."
