        "Title: Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis longitudinal grant proposal, \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks,\" aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescent development. The study will integrate social network research and social brain research to clarify how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure. \n\nThe proposed study will recruit a cohort of 1000 adolescents from 50 classes, with six measurements over a period of three years. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo yearly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to assess the neural basis of social-cognitive functions. Participants will complete experimental tasks designed to evaluate understanding and interaction with others, and ecological momentary assessments will be used to capture real-time social experiences. Social network data will be collected through surveys and mobile sensing techniques.\n\nThis project will provide novel insights into the complex relationships between social networks and the developing social brain, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of adolescent social cognition and its implications for mental health and well-being. The findings of this study will have significant implications for the development of targeted interventions aimed at promoting healthy social development in adolescents."
