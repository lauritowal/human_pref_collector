        "Title: Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for a research project that investigates the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy. The project will focus on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, which allow for the distinction between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents. The primary objectives of the project are to develop an organizing framework to distinguish between these agent types and to conduct a comparative analysis of HANK and Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) models.\n\nThe project will analyze the heterogeneity wedge in consumption or investment and explore the channels through which heterogeneity operates in HANK models and actual economies. A comparative analysis of HANK, TANK, and Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models will be conducted to examine aggregate equilibrium dynamics.\n\nThe proposed research has several important applications, including examining the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on optimal monetary policy. By shedding light on the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying economic outcomes and to inform the design of more effective monetary policy strategies."
