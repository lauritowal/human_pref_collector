        "Title: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries: A Theoretical Framework for Advancing Efficiency and Regulation\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed project, \"Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries,\" seeks to advance the theory of decentralized trade by addressing the pervasive issue of informational asymmetry and limited commitment in repeated transactions. In most trading situations, parties possess unequal information, leading to market inefficiencies. This project aims to provide a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets, focusing on the impact of informational asymmetries on trading mechanisms and market outcomes.\n\nThe proposed research will investigate the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, explore potential remedies for enhancing efficiency, and contribute to the design of market institutions. By shedding light on the intricacies of decentralized markets with informational asymmetries, this project will inform market regulation and policy decisions. The findings will be relevant to various markets, including financial markets, non-durable goods and services, and divisible goods. Ultimately, this project aims to provide insights into trading mechanisms that can improve market efficiency, reduce inefficiencies, and promote better market outcomes."
