        "Title: Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project investigating the origins of state capacity, democracy, and the emergence of political dynasties. We focus on the colonial conquest of Latin America, specifically the initial years of Spanish colonization, as a unique laboratory to examine the long-term effects of early institutions on state development and democratic outcomes.\n\nOur methodological approach combines case studies, panel data analysis, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables to disentangle the causal relationships between colonial-era institutions and modern-day state capacity and democracy. By limiting our analysis to the early years of colonization, we exploit the fact that Spanish conquerors lacked knowledge about the land, allowing us to isolate the impact of initial institutional choices on long-term outcomes.\n\nUtilizing historical documentation from Capitulaciones and Archivo de Indias, we will examine the rules governing early institutions and the location of initial settlements at the subnational level. Our research aims to contribute to the understanding of how colonial legacies shape state development and democratic trajectories, providing insights into the complex relationships between historical institutions, state capacity, and democratization.\n\nThe proposed project will advance our knowledge of the origins of state capacity and democracy, with implications for policymakers seeking to promote institutional development and democratic consolidation in post-colonial societies."
