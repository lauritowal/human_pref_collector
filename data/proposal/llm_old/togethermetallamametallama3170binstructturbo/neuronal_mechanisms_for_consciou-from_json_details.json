        "Title: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NEMERC)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe NEMERC project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception, specifically why some visual stimuli are consciously perceived while others are not. Building on our previous work demonstrating that weak simple stimuli can be reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, this proposal seeks to investigate the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory.\n\nUsing a multi-faceted approach, we will compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions, leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as single neuron recordings in human patients with epilepsy and non-human primates. By characterizing neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex, and employing perturbation methods and functional imaging to measure a 'functional connectome', we will identify brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience.\n\nOur research will provide novel insights into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception, shedding light on the complex interplay between visual cortex, associative brain regions, and working memory. By advancing our understanding of the neural basis of consciousness, NEMERC has the potential to inform the development of novel treatments for neurological disorders and improve our understanding of the human experience."
