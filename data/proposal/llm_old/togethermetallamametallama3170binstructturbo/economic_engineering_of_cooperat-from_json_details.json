        "Title: Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets,\" seeks to address pressing cooperation problems in modern markets and societies. Building on the work of Nobel laureate Alvin Roth, this project adopts an economic engineering approach to design innovative solutions that promote cooperation in the digital world. Through a combination of experimental methods and behavioral game theory, we will tackle three critical challenges: (1) flawed electronic reputation mechanisms, (2) the arms race for speed in real-time financial and electricity market trading, and (3) market designs that conflict with ethical considerations.\n\nOur research will be organized into three work packages, each focusing on a distinct aspect of cooperation in modern markets. The expected outcomes of this project include improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. By developing evidence-based solutions to cooperation problems, we aim to contribute to a more efficient, stable, and equitable economy and society. This project has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of cooperation and inform policy and market design decisions that promote cooperation and social welfare."
