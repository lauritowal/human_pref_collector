        "Title: Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes an interdisciplinary investigation into the development of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in the Greater Gandhāra region during the first millennium of the Common Era. Focusing on Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts written in Indic languages, the research will draw upon recent discoveries from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand. Through a combination of philological, paleographical, and codicological methods, the project will examine the textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of these manuscripts across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India.\n\nThe project's output will include a comprehensive digital archive, an akṣara database, and digital preservation of the manuscripts. Critical editions and translations of the texts will be produced, accompanied by a feature study of their textual, paleographical, and codicological characteristics. A multi-language content comparison will also be conducted to identify patterns and relationships within the manuscript networks. By shedding new light on the development of Buddhist textuality in this pivotal region, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the history of Buddhism and the cultural heritage of the Indian subcontinent."
