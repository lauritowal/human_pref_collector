        "Title: We are all Ayotzinapa: The Role of Digital Media in Shaping Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project proposes an in-depth examination of the role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, using the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico as a case study. By analyzing the impact of new media on citizen engagement and counter-movement against the Mexican government, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the complex dynamics between digital memory, social movements, and state power.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach that combines theoretical and empirical perspectives, this project will explore the concept of disappearance as a crime and its representation in digital memory, as well as the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World. A comparative analysis of Mexico's case with social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina will provide a nuanced understanding of the transnational scope of digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements.\n\nThe project's expected output is a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope, which will shed light on the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries transgression in digital memory. This research has the potential to inform our understanding of the role of digital media in shaping collective memories and mobilizing social movements, and to contribute to the development of new methodologies for studying digital memory and its impact on society."
