        "Title: Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders (NEUROEPIGENETHICS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, NEUROEPIGENETHICS, seeks to investigate the complex interplay between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). By integrating theoretical and empirical approaches, we aim to challenge existing conceptual frameworks that distinguish between innate and acquired, genetic and environmental, and biological and psychosocial factors. This project will explore how social and physical environmental factors shape epigenetic mechanisms, influencing the development and manifestation of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our research will focus on the implications of these findings for capacity responsibility and normative responsibility, with a particular emphasis on the experiences and perspectives of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families. The outcomes of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility, ultimately informing more nuanced and effective approaches to supporting individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders."
