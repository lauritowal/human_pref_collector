        "Title: Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Topological Atlas project proposes a transdisciplinary research program to develop a novel approach to mapping and analyzing border spaces. Contemporary borders are characterized by porosity, shifting boundaries, and solidified barriers, reflecting a dichotomy between openness for some and impenetrability for others. This project seeks to challenge traditional cartographic norms by employing a topological framework, which emphasizes the complex relationships and seamless transitions within border spaces.\n\nThrough a participative approach, the project will utilize digital technologies, including GIS technology and Google Earth, to co-produce visual counter-geographies with migrants and other stakeholders. The resulting Topological Atlas will provide a nuanced representation of borders as experienced by those who encounter them, highlighting the variable enforcement of treaties, mobility of geopolitical territorial formations, and operation beyond legal frameworks.\n\nBy disrupting traditional cartographic norms, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of contemporary borders and their impact on the lives of individuals and communities. The research will be adapted to situations of crisis, ensuring the project's relevance and responsiveness to evolving border dynamics. Ultimately, the Topological Atlas project seeks to answer the question: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?"
