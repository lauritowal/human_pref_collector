        "Title: STUDACT - Exploring Students' Understanding and Appropriation of Global Citizenship Education\n\nAbstract:\n\nSTUDACT is a research project aiming to investigate students' understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship Education (GCE) in diverse contexts. Aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target year of 2030, this project seeks to transform education systems, empower learners, and build peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies. Our hypothesis is that students engage with GCE based on personal traits or context. \n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, involving group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis in six countries (Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK), we will explore how students from different backgrounds understand and appropriate GCE. Our research questions focus on the variations in student understanding within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems. We also aim to examine the alignment between student attitudes and those inferred by international organizations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, or teachers.\n\nBy treating students as core partners and agentic participants, STUDACT will provide a systematic baseline on student understanding and appropriation of GCE, addressing the current lack of research in this area. The project's findings will inform policy and curricula development, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the SDG target year 2030."
