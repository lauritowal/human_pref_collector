        "Title: The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes the development of an alternative theory of moral progress, expanding the expanding circle account to overcome current limitations. The traditional theory is constrained by parochial empathy, where altruism is primarily directed towards friends and kin. Our goal is to extend moral concern beyond features that are eth immediate, but morally arbitrary, such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. We will explore different forms of moral progress, attitudes not bound by evolutionary constraints, and the potential of smart institutions to bypass the limits of our inherited psychology. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and inclusive framework for understanding moral progress, enabling us to better address pressing social and environmental issues. By rethinking the boundaries of moral concern, we can work towards a more just and equitable society for all beings."
