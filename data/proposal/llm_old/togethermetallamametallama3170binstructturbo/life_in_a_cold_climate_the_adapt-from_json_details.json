        "Title: Life in a Cold Climate: Unraveling Cereal Adaptation and the Establishment of Agriculture in Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe widespread adoption of agriculture in Europe during the Neolithic period remains a complex phenomenon, influenced by both human and environmental factors. This project, \"Life in a Cold Climate,\" seeks to rectify the current imbalance between these two dimensions by investigating the impact of environmental adaptation on the spread of agriculture in Europe. Focusing on barley and wheat, our team will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining population genomics, ecological modeling, ancient DNA sequencing, and advanced computational methods to identify the key genetic adaptations that facilitated the establishment of farming in Europe.\n\nOur research aims to identify the loci in barley and wheat genomes under selection, associate these with ecogeographical variables, and reconstruct the temporal order of adaptations. By integrating these findings with archaeological, demographic, and archaeobotanical data, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between environmental pressures, crop productivity, and human population dynamics during the Neolithic transition. The expected outcomes of this project will not only shed new light on the early history of European agriculture but also offer valuable insights into the complex relationships between humans, crops, and the environment, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the past and its relevance to contemporary societal challenges."
