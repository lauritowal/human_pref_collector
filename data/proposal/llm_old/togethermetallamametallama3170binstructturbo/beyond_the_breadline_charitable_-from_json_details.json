        "Title: Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe rise of charitable food provision (CFP) has become a crucial buffer against food insecurity and hunger, particularly in the wake of the Great Recession and reduced welfare benefits. However, existing research lacks a robust framework for comparing CFP across countries and cities, neglecting the interplay between CFP, welfare regimes, and civil society. This project seeks to bridge this gap by charting the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, with in-depth case studies of Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam.\n\nThrough event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, we will investigate the dynamics of CFP, including professionalized sectors, provider interrelationships, and ties with state and non-state authorities. We will also introduce an innovative tool for real-time data collection in city workshops. Our research aims to create new knowledge, offer comparative insights into food support and insecurity, and craft an overarching framework for CFP comparison. The anticipated impact of this project is to extend CFP comparison to other countries and cities, ultimately informing sustainable food surplus use and waste reduction strategies that reflect societal changes."
