        "Title: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe increasing prevalence of widowhood in ageing societies poses significant challenges for individuals, families, and policymakers. Despite this trend, research on widowhood remains underdeveloped compared to divorce, with a limited understanding of the risk and vulnerability associated with bereavement. This project proposes a comprehensive social demography of widowhood, examining the probability and duration of widowhood, as well as the mental health and economic consequences for individuals and their families.\n\nThe study will employ a four-pillar approach, focusing on (1) risk and vulnerability, (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age, (3) country differences, and (4) changes over time. Utilizing high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries between 1985 and 2050, the project will apply advanced statistical methods to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates of the challenges facing the widowed population and their family members.\n\nThe research aims to facilitate new insights into sustainable pension and elder care systems, ultimately informing policies that address the needs of this growing demographic. By exploring the complexities of widowhood in ageing societies, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and economic implications of bereavement and inform evidence-based solutions to support the well-being of widowed individuals and their families."
