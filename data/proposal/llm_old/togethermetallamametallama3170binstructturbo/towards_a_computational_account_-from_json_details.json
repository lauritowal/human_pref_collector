        "Title: Towards a Computational Account of Natural Sequential Behavior\n\nAbstract:\n\nEveryday tasks, such as navigating through a room or making a sandwich, involve complex sequential decisions under uncertainty. This project aims to develop computational models that capture the intricacies of human perception, cognition, and action in these tasks. We propose an interdisciplinary approach, integrating psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning.\n\nOur objectives are two-fold: first, to understand and model sequential actions involving perceptual uncertainty and action variability; and second, to characterize internal and external costs and benefits in the context of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty. We will employ behavioral experiments, including classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making, to gather data on human behavior.\n\nBy analyzing the data using computational models, we expect to recover subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits, including effort, and action variability. This project builds upon our previous experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical work in modeling behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis. The outcomes of this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of natural sequential behavior and contribute to the development of more accurate and human-centered artificial intelligence systems."
