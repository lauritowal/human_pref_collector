        "Title: Microfoundations of Collective Defence: A Cross-National Investigation of Public Opinion and Allied Decision-Making\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence, focusing on the views of individuals in key NATO member states. By integrating experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology approaches, our project aims to investigate how attitudes towards allied assistance are formed, aggregated into public opinion, and influence decision-makers in allied states. We hypothesize that strategic context, types of collective defence scenarios, and public opinion polarization play crucial roles in shaping the dynamics of military alliances. To test these hypotheses, we will employ novel immersive mixed-media experiments, providing participants with an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience. Our findings have significant policy implications, as they could redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances. By exploring the microfoundations of collective defence, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between public opinion, decision-making, and the effectiveness of military alliances."
