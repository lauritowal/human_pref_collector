        "Title: The Legal Status of Religious Minorities in the Euro-Mediterranean World (5th-16th centuries): A Collaborative Interdisciplinary Project\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project aims to collect, publish, and study the legal texts that defined the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe and the Euro-Mediterranean world from the 5th to the 16th centuries. By examining a diverse range of sources, including Roman law, Canon law, national or royal law, and rabbinical and Islamic legal texts, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and often intersecting laws that governed the lives of Christian, Muslim, and other religious minority groups.\n\nThe project's outputs will include a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, and a sourcebook of selected legal texts. A series of workshops, an international conference, and comparative thematic studies will facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. The project's ultimate goal is to create a major reference tool for research in the history of minority law and interreligious relations, promoting innovative and interdisciplinary research across traditional divides. By shedding light on the historical experiences of religious minorities, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of interfaith relations and the evolution of minority law in the Euro-Mediterranean world."
