        "Title: Unraveling the Enigma of the Bantu Expansion: A Multidisciplinary Investigation of Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change, and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative, cross-disciplinary research project that aims to shed light on the long-standing controversy surrounding the Bantu Expansion, a pivotal event in African history that occurred during the Late Holocene. By integrating archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics, our team will investigate the timing, location, and characteristics of the first Bantu-speaking village communities in Central Africa. Fieldwork will take place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola, with a focus on reconstructing the subsistence strategies, land use, and interactions with hunter-gatherers of these early communities.\n\nUsing a combination of lexical reconstruction, phylogenetic modeling, and the analysis of archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data, we will reconstruct a holistic view of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in the region. Our research will provide a critical understanding of the complex dynamics driving the Bantu Expansion, with significant implications for the fields of African history, linguistics, and archaeology. By fostering interuniversity collaboration and a multidisciplinary approach, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of this pivotal event and its far-reaching consequences for the continent."
