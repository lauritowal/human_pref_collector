        "Title: Information Services: Competition and Externalities\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive examination of the economics of information services, focusing on the strategic interactions and externalities that arise in the production and exchange of these services. By integrating theoretical and empirical approaches, the study aims to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between information services, physical infrastructures, and competition policy.\n\nThe project consists of four parts: (1) Background theory, exploring two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities; (2) Virtual layer, investigating recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs using empirical data from e-commerce platforms; (3) Physical layer, analyzing pricing and investment strategies in the context of net-neutrality and data pricing; and (4) Competition policy, examining the implications of two-sided markets on policy-making.\n\nThrough the development of original dynamic investment models and tools for competition policy makers, this research will provide valuable insights into the role of externalities in shaping the economics of information services. The findings are expected to inform evidence-based policy decisions, promoting a more efficient and competitive information services market."
