        "Title: OsciLang: A Novel Neurofeedback System for Diagnosing and Intervening in Language and Reading Impairments\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of OsciLang, a wearable brain-computer interface neurofeedback system designed to detect and treat language disorders, specifically dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). By leveraging the synchronization of brain activity with speech signals, OsciLang aims to improve literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia by enhancing their brain-speech tracking capabilities.\n\nBuilding on research demonstrating reduced auditory tracking in the delta band in dyslexic readers, OsciLang utilizes a novel neurofeedback mechanism based on phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech. The system will provide real-time EEG-based feedback, enabling users to exert top-down control over specific brain activation patterns. Key monitoring parameters will include phase coherence at theta and delta bands.\n\nThe proposed system has the potential to significantly improve literacy skills in dyslexic individuals, even in noisy environments. Furthermore, OsciLang's framework and technology can be extended to enhance reading abilities in a broader population. The successful development of OsciLang will provide an affordable, lightweight, and user-friendly tool for diagnosing and intervening in language and reading impairments, addressing a critical need in the field."
