        "Title: Solidarity in the European Union\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity in the context of the European Union (EUSOL1). The proposed project will then apply this model to four critical issues facing the EU: the free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession (EUSOL2). By providing a nuanced understanding of solidarity in these key areas, this research aims to inform policy debates and contribute to a more cohesive and equitable European Union. The project's normative account of solidarity will offer valuable insights into the complexities of European integration, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the EU's social and economic dynamics."
