        "Title: Crisis on the Margins of the Byzantine Empire: A Bio-archaeological Project on Resilience and Collapse in Early Christian Development of the Negev Desert\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary project exploring the dynamics of collapse and resilience in the Byzantine early Christian urban centres of the Negev Desert during the 4th-7th century AD. Through an innovative integration of archaeology, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, and geological analysis, this project will examine the impact of social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and disease on the long-term sustainability of complex societies in resource-limited environments.\n\nOur research will provide critical new insights into the vulnerabilities of marginal regions in the face of global challenges. By analyzing household, landscape, and artefactual data, we will re-evaluate current understanding of the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development. While acknowledging the risks associated with working with historical and proxy data, we anticipate significant benefits from this research, including more nuanced generalizations regarding societal vulnerability and the development of evidence-based strategies for mitigating the effects of collapse. Our findings will have far-reaching implications for understanding the complexities of human societies in the face of environmental and socio-economic stress."
