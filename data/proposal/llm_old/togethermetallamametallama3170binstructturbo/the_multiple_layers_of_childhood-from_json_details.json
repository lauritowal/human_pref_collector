        "Title: The Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Adversity: A Complex Systems Approach to Understanding Intergenerational Health Inequality\n\nAbstract:\n\nChildhood adversity is a critical determinant of long-lasting health inequities, with effects extending across multiple generations. Existing research primarily focuses on social adversity, overlooking the complex interplay between biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental factors that shape life course trajectories. The \"Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Adversity\" initiative aims to create a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of childhood adversity in 2 million people across three generations, using an interdisciplinary approach integrating data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework.\n\nThis project seeks to understand the patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of multiple layers of childhood adversity, redirecting the focus from a single aspect of adversity to a comprehensive understanding of its intersecting forms. By integrating a nationwide policy data lab, we will simulate the impact of policy interventions on childhood adversity and identify targets for support, ultimately informing evidence-based policies to mitigate health inequities. Our research will have significant implications for policymakers, practitioners, and families, providing critical insights into the prevention and mitigation of childhood adversity and its long-lasting effects on health and well-being."
