        "Title: Overcoming the Frontiers of Biomolecular Studies on Human History and Adaptation using Palaeoproteomics (BACKWARD)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe BACKWARD project aims to revolutionize our understanding of human history and adaptation by developing and deploying cutting-edge palaeoproteomic workflows, advanced mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic solutions. This project seeks to address the phylogenetic relationships among extinct hominids in Africa and Asia, extending molecular-based phylogeny beyond the limitations of ancient DNA (aDNA). By applying palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing, we will reconstruct the evolutionary history of species that went extinct millions of years ago. The project will focus on the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia, with potential applications in identifying and correlating processes of human brain expansion and reorganization. Additionally, the project will explore the commercial repurposing of palaeoproteomics in diagnostics, the food industry, and pharmaceuticals. A strong partnership among participating institutions will be established, with the goal of achieving a transformative impact akin to that of aDNA over the past two decades."
