        "Title: Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe,\" seeks to investigate the location strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their territorial impacts across Europe. Given the significant economic influence of MNEs - contributing over a quarter of the world's GDP, with a value-added of US$16 trillion - and the growing role of developing economies in foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows, it is essential to understand the dynamics of MNEs' location choices and their consequences for regional development.\n\nThis project aims to bridge existing gaps in literature by providing in-depth analysis of the complex relationships between MNEs, institutions, and innovation in European regions. By doing so, it will offer valuable insights and policy-making tools for decision-makers seeking to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The project's findings will have significant implications for regional development policies, particularly in the context of increasing FDI outflows from developing economies, which rose from 16% of global outflows in 2007 to 31% in 2012, with a notable $426 billion in outflows from developing economies in 2012 alone."
