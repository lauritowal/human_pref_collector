        "Title: Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC): Elucidating the Functional Role of Consciousness in Adaptive Behavior\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe CDAC project aims to elucidate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior through a multidisciplinary approach combining empirical, computational, and robot-based methodologies. Our central hypothesis posits that a shift towards intentional agent-dominated environments necessitates novel control architectures, which we propose to develop and test. We will address three primary objectives: (1) resolve the paradox of consciousness and action, (2) identify the neuronal principles of consciousness, and (3) construct a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture.\n\nOur proposed framework integrates parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation, with a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene generation. We hypothesize that conscious scenes play a crucial role in credit assignment and planning beyond immediate information. The project's expected outcomes include a state-of-the-art framework, system-level models of conscious architecture, computational studies of the neuronal substrate, empirical validation with humanoid robots and stroke patients, and the development of advanced tools.\n\nBy addressing fundamental questions on the function and genesis of consciousness, the CDAC project will significantly advance our understanding of the mind and brain. Additionally, our research will contribute to the development of new neurorehabilitation technologies and the next generation of robots with advanced social competence."
