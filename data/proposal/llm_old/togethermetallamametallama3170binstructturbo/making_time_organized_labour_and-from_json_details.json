        "Title: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" aims to advance our understanding of the role of organized labour in promoting sustainable work policies through care-related leave rights and protections in Europe. The project focuses on the intersection of work-life balance, social policies, and trade union activism, with a particular emphasis on the predominance of women in caregiving roles and union membership.\n\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of 50 years of care leave provisions in rich democracies (1965-present) with in-depth qualitative case studies of Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, this project will investigate the influence mechanisms of trade unions in shaping care leave policies, including child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits.\n\nBy examining the relationships between organized labour, policy innovation, and institutional settings, this research will contribute to the development of comparative labour studies and theories of union-policy relationships. The project's outcomes will provide valuable insights into the role of organized labour as a partner in developing sustainable work policies, ultimately informing more effective social policies for work-life balance and care-related leave provisions."
