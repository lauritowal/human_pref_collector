        "Title: Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project seeks to rewrite the history of Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity (circa 3rd-6th centuries CE), a period marked by significant transformations in the Roman Empire. Our research will focus on the persistence of a high-level legal culture, the manuscript transmission of juristic texts, and the role of classical jurists in shaping the legal landscape. A particular emphasis will be placed on the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations, including the works of Justinian as a lawgiver.\n\nThrough a collaborative effort among three research teams, this project will bring together scholars from diverse disciplines to investigate the complex relationships between juristic writings, imperial legislation, and the social context of Late Antiquity. Key activities will include the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, workshops with European scholars, and a final international conference on Late Antique legal culture.\n\nThe project's expected outputs include a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity and its manuscript transmission, this project will significantly contribute to our knowledge of this pivotal period in Western legal history."
