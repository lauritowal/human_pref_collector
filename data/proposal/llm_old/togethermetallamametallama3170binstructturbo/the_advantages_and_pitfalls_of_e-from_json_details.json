        "Title: The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project proposes to investigate the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. Through a combination of empirical approaches, lab experiments, and field experiments, we aim to understand the mechanisms underlying user engagement, its direct value for businesses, and the broader societal implications of user engagement expectations.\n\nOur preliminary results indicate that calls to action have strong effects on conversion and information revelation, suggesting significant economic and social impacts. Building on these findings, this project seeks to characterize the effects of calls to action in multiple product domains and isolate the underlying mechanisms driving these effects.\n\nIn collaboration with a leading website-development service provider operating under a freemium business model, this project will provide valuable insights into the economic and societal implications of social computing. Our expected outcomes include an enhanced understanding of the direct value of user engagement for businesses and the broader societal implications of user engagement expectations. By shedding light on the advantages and pitfalls of elicited online user engagement, this research aims to contribute to a deeper economic and societal understanding of social computing."
