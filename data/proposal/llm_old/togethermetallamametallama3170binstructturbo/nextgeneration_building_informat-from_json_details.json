        "Title: NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe built environment has a profound impact on human behavior and quality of life. However, current Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools are limited in their ability to evaluate the effects of built environments on users. These tools focus primarily on physical and material characteristics, neglecting the critical aspects of building use, context, and intended user experience. As a result, they fail to predict how buildings will influence future users' lives and activities, and whether they will meet the needs of their intended users.\n\nThis proposal seeks to address these limitations by developing a comprehensive building modeling method that integrates form, function, and use information. The proposed research aims to create next-generation BIM systems that account for user behavior and context, enabling designers and architects to create buildings that better meet the needs of their users. The benefits of this research will be twofold: better designed buildings that enhance user experience, and an improved ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment. By advancing the field of BIM, this project has the potential to transform the way we design and interact with buildings, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and livable future."
