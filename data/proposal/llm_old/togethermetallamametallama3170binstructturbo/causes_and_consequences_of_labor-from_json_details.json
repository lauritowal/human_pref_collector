        "Title: LABFLEX - Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe LABFLEX project aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, a pressing concern in today's globalized and rapidly changing work environment. The proposed research will examine the interplay between globalization, technological advancements, and workplace transformations, and their impact on labor market flexibility. Specifically, we will analyze the effects of labor market flexibility on wage inequality, division of resources, and worker well-being. To address these research questions, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining register data, experimental evidence, and text analysis of job vacancies. Our research design will allow us to disentangle the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, including the role of worker preferences, technological advancements, and labor market institutions. The project's expected outcomes include new evidence on the drivers of labor market flexibility and its impacts on workers and society as a whole. By shedding light on the complexities of labor market flexibility, LABFLEX will inform policy debates and contribute to the development of more effective labor market policies that promote fairness, equality, and economic growth."
