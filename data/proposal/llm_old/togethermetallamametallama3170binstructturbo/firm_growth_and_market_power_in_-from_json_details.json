        "Title: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy,\" aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power, providing insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. Drawing inspiration from the European Commission's 2007 reference on market power, this five-year research endeavor seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical models of international trade and empirical evidence. By incorporating richer firm behavior in trade models and examining the impact of trade and industrial policies on growth, particularly in less developed markets, this project addresses critical research questions.\n\nThese questions include how trade and competition policy can ensure that consumers benefit from globalization when firms have market power, how domestic policies affect small farmers in agribusiness, how industrial policies influence firm growth through input linkages, and the impact of banking globalization on firm growth in the real sector. The project will focus on developing economies, integrating theoretical work with rich data to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research project are to provide new insights into welfare and policy, offering a basis for informed policymaking in a globalized world. By advancing our understanding of firm growth and market power, this project will contribute to more effective policy design, ultimately benefiting consumers and promoting economic development."
