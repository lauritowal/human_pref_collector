        "Title: Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities,\" seeks to bridge the gap between geographical information systems (GIS) and the digital humanities. By developing methodologies for integrating unstructured texts into a GIS environment, we aim to revolutionize the analysis of historical and literary sources. Leveraging the expertise of the principal investigator in digital humanities and historical geographical information systems (HGIS), this project will employ a combination of GIS and corpus linguistics to examine two case studies: the representation of the English Lake District across different time periods, and the mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England and Wales.\n\nThrough a range of outreach activities, including short courses, expert meetings, and a conference, we will disseminate the findings and methodologies to a broader audience. This project will have a major impact within the humanities and beyond, with applications in the analysis of ancient manuscripts, modern newspapers, and e-resources. By answering the research question \"How can textual sources within a GIS broaden our understanding of the humanities?\", we will establish a new paradigm for the spatial humanities, bringing together HGIS, digital humanities, corpus linguistics, literary studies, and history."
