        "Title: METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe METABODY project introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining to capture the dynamic interplay between prior expectations and new information in shaping body image. In today's modern context, body image is a complex phenomenon that involves a delicate balance between invariance and invention, reflecting an ongoing negotiation of identity.\n\nThis project aims to investigate body image as a dynamic inference process, focusing on the metacognitive level and the interplay between prior beliefs and new information. We hypothesize that disturbances in body image are related to first- and second-order metacognitive abilities.\n\nTo address this hypothesis, the METABODY project will consist of three empirical work packages: (1) Body Metacognition, examining the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives; (2) Body Mentalizing, exploring the balance between embodied experience and social perspectives; and (3) Body Decision Making, investigating the balance between current, future, and ideal body perspectives.\n\nUltimately, the METABODY project seeks to advance our understanding of identity negotiation in the context of body modification options, shedding light on the intricate processes that shape our body image and inform our decisions about our bodies. By exploring the dynamic interplay between cognition, metacognition, and social influences, this project aims to contribute to the development of innovative interventions and strategies for promoting positive body image and well-being."
