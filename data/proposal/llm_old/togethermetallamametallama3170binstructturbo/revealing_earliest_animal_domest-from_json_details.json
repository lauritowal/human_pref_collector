        "Title: Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive Neolithic archaeological research project focused on the early domestication of animals in the Fertile Crescent. Titled \"Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent,\" the project aims to unravel the paradigms surrounding the origin of animal domesticates, particularly sheep and goats, by investigating the earliest evidences of their management.\n\nThrough the application of biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, the project will examine key mechanisms underlying the domestication process, including the control of animals' reproductive cycles, changes to their feeding habits, and the interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. A comparative analysis of faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centres will be conducted across the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent.\n\nBy shedding light on how human societies altered the biology and ecology of early domesticates, this project seeks to identify the earliest caprine management practices and establish the timing and location of animal domestication processes. The findings of this research will significantly contribute to our understanding of the complex relationships between humans and animals during the Neolithic period, providing new insights into the emergence of animal domestication as a cornerstone of human societies."
