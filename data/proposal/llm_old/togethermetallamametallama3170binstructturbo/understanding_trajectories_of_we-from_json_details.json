        "Title: Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability (WEALTHTRAJECT)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project, WEALTHTRAJECT, seeks to illuminate the complex and diverse patterns of wealth accumulation across individuals' lifetimes. By combining longitudinal data from surveys and administrative registers, and collecting novel life history data, we aim to document and analyze variability in wealth trajectories, identify intragenerational drivers of this variability, and establish intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth trajectories.\n\nOur innovative approach emphasizes the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses, moving beyond traditional analyses that focus on average wealth outcomes. By adopting advanced quantitative methods, we will provide a more nuanced understanding of long-term wealth accumulation trajectories, shedding light on the mechanisms driving wealth inequality.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute significantly to the existing literature on wealth inequality by providing new insights into the trajectories of wealth accumulation and the factors influencing them. Our findings will have important implications for policymakers seeking to address wealth disparities and promote economic mobility. Ultimately, this research will enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics underlying wealth accumulation, informing evidence-based policies to reduce wealth inequality and promote more equitable economic outcomes."
