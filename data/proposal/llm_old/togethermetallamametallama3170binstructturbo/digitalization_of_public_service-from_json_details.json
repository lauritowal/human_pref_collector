        "Title: Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development\n\nAbstract:\n\nApproximately 5.7 million annual deaths and 100 million people living in poverty are attributed to limited access to public services, as reported by the Lancet Health Commission in 2018. In response, governments globally are adopting digital technologies to enhance service delivery. However, low-income countries face significant challenges, with one-third of digitalization projects abandoned, as reported in the 2016 World Development Report.\n\nThis project aims to investigate the determinants of success or failure of digitalization and improve efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery. Through a collaborative effort with local governments and NGOs, we will conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The study will focus on two key areas: demand for public services via digital access and supply of in-person services with remote monitoring.\n\nThe findings of this research will inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately seeking to increase access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment. By addressing the risks of digitization projects, such as excluding individuals with limited connectivity, we aim to promote inclusive development and reduce disparities in public service delivery."
