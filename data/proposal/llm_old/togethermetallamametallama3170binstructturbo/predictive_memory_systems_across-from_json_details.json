        "Title: Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan (PIVOTAL)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan (PIVOTAL) project proposes to investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying predictive processing in relation to memory across the human lifespan. Leveraging the predictive coding framework, this research aims to advance our understanding of neurocognitive architectures and examine the role of predictive processing in shaping memory systems. \n\nThe study will address two key empirical questions: (1) the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, and (2) the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation and senescence. By integrating predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, and employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs, this project will provide novel insights into the dynamic interplay between prediction, memory, and brain development.\n\nThe study population will comprise children, younger adults, and older adults, with a focus on episodic and semantic memory types. By examining the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits and their developmental orientations, PIVOTAL aims to develop a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle. The project's findings will have significant implications for understanding the emergence of cognitive disorders across the lifespan, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions and therapies."
