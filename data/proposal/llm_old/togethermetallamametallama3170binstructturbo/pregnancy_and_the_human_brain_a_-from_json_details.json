        "Title: Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\n\nAbstract:\n\nPregnancy is a transformative period in a woman's life, marked by significant physiological and psychological changes. Recent evidence suggests that pregnancy also leads to profound, long-lasting changes in brain structure, revealing a remarkable window of neuroplasticity. This prospective cohort study, \"Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity,\" aims to comprehensively map changes in brain anatomy and function across pregnancy and the postpartum period.\n\nBy leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, psychopedagogic measures, and biomedical assessments, we will track a cohort of women from before conception through the postpartum period. Our investigation will focus on maternal caregiving, mental health disorders, and memory issues, with the goal of pinpointing key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity and revealing the neural substrates underlying adaptive and maladaptive processes.\n\nThe proposed research has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the neurobiological journey to motherhood and the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related mental health disorders. Our study will lay the foundation for the emerging field of human neuroscience, providing novel insights into the dynamic interplay between brain, body, and behavior during this critical period of development."
