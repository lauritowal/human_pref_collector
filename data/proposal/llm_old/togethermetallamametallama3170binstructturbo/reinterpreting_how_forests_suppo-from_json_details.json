        "Title: Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite global efforts to address nutrient deficiencies affecting over 2 billion people, a crucial blind spot remains: the role of forests in supporting dietary quality. Traditional solutions focus on increasing agricultural production and access to calories, overlooking the contributions of forests. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by reinterpreting the linkages between forests and dietary quality in low-income countries.\n\nOur research will employ a multi-scale, multi-country approach, combining data-rich methodologies to investigate the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality. We will develop a framework on forest-diet linkages and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality, focusing on the benefits of wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock that contribute to meat, milk, eggs, and manure production.\n\nThrough a broad-scale perspective, hotspots identification, and in-depth fieldwork in two locations, we will explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes, and elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes. Our findings aim to shift the conceptualization of food security, highlighting the critical role of forests in supporting people's dietary quality and informing more effective strategies to address global nutrient deficiencies."
