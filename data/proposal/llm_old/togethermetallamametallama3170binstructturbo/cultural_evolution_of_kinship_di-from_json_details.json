        "Title: Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project investigates the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time, seeking to understand the dynamics of change in kinship terminologies and family norms. Through a multidisciplinary approach integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, our research will analyze the universality of patterns in kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, and link individual usage patterns to historical processes. We will also characterize the cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children in small-scale, non-Western communities.\n\nOur research will consist of three interconnected components: VARIKIN-Evolution, which applies comparative phylogenetic modeling to kinship terminologies and family norms in eight language families; VARIKIN-Usage, which examines the usage of kinship language through corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews; and VARIKIN-Development, which investigates children's acquisition and understanding of kinship through participant observation and elicitation tasks. By bridging the gap between macro-evolutionary patterns and micro-evolutionary processes, this project aims to provide a comprehensiveidores understanding of kinship diversity and its evolution over time. Our highly multidisciplinary team is well-positioned to tackle this complex and multifaceted research question."
