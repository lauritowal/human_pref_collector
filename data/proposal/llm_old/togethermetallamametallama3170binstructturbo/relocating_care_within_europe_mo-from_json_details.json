        "Title: Relocating Care within Europe: An Exploration of Transnational Care Mobility and its Welfare Implications\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multi-sited anthropological study, \"Relocating Care within Europe,\" seeks to investigate the phenomenon of care relocation, where elderly individuals from Austria and Germany are moved to care homes in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where care costs are significantly lower, approximately one-third of the cost in their home countries. This trend, referred to as \"grandmother deportation\" and \"geriatric colonialism,\" highlights the complex entanglements of welfare states and entitlements across borders.\n\nFocusing on the intersection of marketization of care, labour migration, and regional migration, this research aims to understand the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and the implications of care relocation on the elderly and their families. Through in-depth ethnographic studies, investigation of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and historical analysis of the German and Habsburg-Hungarian legacy, this project will explore the complex dynamics of care relocation and its future-making potential.\n\nUltimately, this research seeks to shed light on the question of what it means to become old and in need of care in an intertwined Europe, and how care relocation can be seen as a response to the privatization of care landscapes. By examining the experiences of care homes, caregivers, and elderly individuals, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and political implications of care relocation, informing policies and practices that prioritize the well-being of the elderly in Europe."
