        "Title: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History (NUCLEARWATERS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nNUCLEARWATERS is a groundbreaking project that seeks to revolutionize our understanding of nuclear energy history by placing water at its core. By adopting a novel, water-centred approach, this research challenges the conventional narrative of nuclear energy development and instead situates it within the broader context of centuries of hydraulic engineering and hydraulic civilizations.\n\nThrough a comprehensive investigation of historical water-manipulating technologies and competing conceptions of risk, this project will explore the intricate relationships between water, nuclear energy, and human societies. Six work packages will delve into key themes, including the formation of the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the Soviet Union's nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley's nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nBy repositioning water as a central actor in the history of nuclear energy, NUCLEARWATERS aims to resolve key riddles in the field and provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between technology, environment, and society. The project's findings will have far-reaching implications for the history of technology field, environmental history, and the ongoing public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond, contributing to a more informed discussion about the role of nuclear energy in our collective future."
