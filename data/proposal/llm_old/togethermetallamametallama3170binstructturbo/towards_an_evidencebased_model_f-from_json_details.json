        "Title: Towards an Evidence-Based Model for Big Data Policing: An Interdisciplinary Approach\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking research project aimed at developing an evidence-based model for big data policing. By integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions, our project addresses the current knowledge gaps in this field, including fragmented expertise, lack of interdisciplinarity, and insufficient scientific evaluations of big data policing models. Our objective is to create a model that optimizes police resource deployment, reduces crime rates, and ensures transparency, reliability, validity, effectiveness, and adherence to legal and ethical standards.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, our project will analyze key variables such as previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, and police patrol intensity to identify high-risk crime locations. The model will be tested through randomized controlled trials, adhering to European and interdisciplinary principles. Our project will also provide a unique opportunity for PhD training in four tracks: statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical. By focusing on transparency and accountability, our approach differs significantly from commercial and economic initiatives in the field. The proposed project has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of evidence-based big data policing strategies, ultimately leading to safer and more just communities."
