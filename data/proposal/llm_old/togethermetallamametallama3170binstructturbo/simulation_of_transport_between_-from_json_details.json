        "Title: Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA), aims to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system to model ancient water and land-borne transportation networks between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier. By integrating historical research, experimental data, and technological advancements, STRADA seeks to reconstruct the complex relationships between transportation systems, environmental factors, and the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe proposed project will focus on three key areas: (1) reconstructing ancient land and water routes, (2) experimentally determining the performance of various transportation means under changing environmental conditions, and (3) developing a time-related simulation system that incorporates local topography, historical weather data, and the physical limitations of ancient transportation methods. The simulation system will be designed with a modular approach, ensuring sustainability and future extensibility.\n\nSTRADA's research will explore the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscapes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier. By introducing dynamic simulations into historical research, this project will offer a novel approach to understanding the ancient transport system and its influence on the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire."
