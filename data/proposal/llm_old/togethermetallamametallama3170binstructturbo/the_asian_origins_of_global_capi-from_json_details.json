        "Title: The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis five-year research project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins of modern industrial capitalism by examining the pivotal role of European East India companies in Asian ports during the period 1500-1800. Focusing on over 150 factories that served as key nodes in the global trade network, this study aims to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, and recast the narrative of global economic change and the emergence of capitalism.\n\nBy integrating large archival repositories and collaborating with scholars globally, this project will investigate the economic activities in imperial trading centres, the interactive roles of European and local merchants, and the spatial dynamics that facilitated the growth of intercontinental trade. Building on the New History of Capitalism and the decolonization of the history of capitalism, this research will develop a spatial theory of capitalist development that highlights the significance of Asian ports in shaping the course of global economic history.\n\nBy challenging traditional Eurocentric narratives, this project will provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex, interconnected processes that underpinned the rise of modern capitalism. The findings of this research will contribute to a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of the global economic past, with significant implications for our understanding of contemporary economic systems and the ongoing legacies of colonialism."
