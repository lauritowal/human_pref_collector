        "Title: South American Population History Revisited: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the Upper Amazon\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support a multidisciplinary investigation of the evolution of linguistic diversity in the Upper Amazon region of western South America. By reconstructing and comparing geographical, socio-historical, and communicative layers of history, our project aims to uncover past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade that have shaped the complex linguistic landscape of the region. The Upper Amazon, with its diverse sociohistorical layers, offers a unique window into the interaction between ecology, human behavior, and cognition.\n\nOur research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, combining insights from linguistics, anthropology, ecology, and history to understand the complex dynamics that have influenced linguistic diversity in the region. By analyzing patterns of linguistic diversity across the Upper Amazon, we will shed light on the historical processes that have shaped the distribution of languages and language families.\n\nThe proposed project has significant implications for our understanding of social dynamics and their impact on linguistic diversity. By using linguistic diversity as a window on our past, we will gain a deeper understanding of the historical events that have shaped the region and its inhabitants. Our findings will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between ecology, human behavior, and cognition, with broader implications for the study of human history and cultural evolution."
