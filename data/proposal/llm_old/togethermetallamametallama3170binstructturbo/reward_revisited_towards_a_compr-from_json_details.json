        "Title: Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a novel, unifying conceptual and neural framework that elucidates the complex mechanisms by which reward influences human cognition. By integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the impact of irrelevant information, our project aims to extend the current understanding of reward effects on cognitive operations, including motivation, conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach will employ optimized neuroimaging methods to investigate the neural activity underlying reward processing in the dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems. This research will have significant implications for basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research, providing valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind and shedding light on disturbances in DA and NA systems in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nUltimately, our project aims to contribute to the development of more effective interventions and treatments for these disorders, and to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between reward, motivation, and cognition in both healthy and pathological conditions."
