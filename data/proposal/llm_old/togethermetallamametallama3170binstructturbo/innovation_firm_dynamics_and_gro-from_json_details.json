        "Title: INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: What Do We Learn from French Firm-Level Data?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the interplay between innovation, firm dynamics, and economic growth, grounded in the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth. Leveraging French firm-level data, our study will explore the relationships between innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions in driving growth. We will address four key research questions: (1) the measurement of productivity growth, focusing on the factors contributing to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth and the role of new innovation; (2) the causal links between trade and innovation; (3) the impact of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship and self-employment incentives; and (4) the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing.\n\nOur research will shed light on pressing growth challenges, including the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics. By identifying key policy levers, this project will inform the design of effective growth policies that promote innovation, social mobility, and overall wellbeing. By confronting theory and data, our study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between innovation, growth, and social outcomes, ultimately informing evidence-based policy interventions."
