        "Title: The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multidisciplinary research proposal seeks to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the normal development of parental caregiving and its disruptions. The project aims to elucidate the brain changes associated with the transition to parenthood in both women and men, using a combination of neuroimaging techniques and psychological testing.\n\nThe study will comprise three interconnected subprojects. Subproject 1 will conduct a longitudinal investigation of normal parental caregiving development, starting before pregnancy and continuing postpartum. This will involve assessing structural and functional brain changes, as well as behavioral measures of caregiving tasks. Subproject 2 will employ a cross-sectional design to examine the effects of disrupted parental caregiving, focusing on two specific disruptions: parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality of cleft lip and palate. Subproject 3 will integrate the findings from the first two subprojects using advanced computational models to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying parenting development.\n\nThis research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the neural basis of parenting and its vulnerabilities, ultimately informing the development of interventions aimed at supporting new parents and their children. By elucidating the brain mechanisms underlying parental caregiving, this project has the potential to improve outcomes for families and promote healthy child development."
