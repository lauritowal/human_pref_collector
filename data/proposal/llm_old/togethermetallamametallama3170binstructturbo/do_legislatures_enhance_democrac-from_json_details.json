        "Title: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, a context in which legislatures are often assumed to be powerless or merely symbolic institutions. Our research aims to shed light on the question of whether legislatures in authoritarian countries have the potential to enhance democracy. Through a mixed-methods design combining qualitative and quantitative data, we will examine the legislative behavior, interaction patterns, and constituency responsiveness of national assemblies in seven African countries. Our investigation will focus on three key areas: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness.\n\nBy collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies, our study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between legislatures, democracy, and authoritarianism in Africa. Our research team, comprising partner institutions in seven African countries, is well-equipped to tackle the challenges associated with studying opaque authoritarian regimes. Our findings will have important implications for the design of democracy promotion programs and the development of more effective strategies for supporting democratic transitions in Africa."
