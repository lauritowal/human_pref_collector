        "Title: Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of Universal Health Coverage and the Public Good in Africa\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis anthropological research project proposes an in-depth exploration of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Africa, shedding light on its interpretation, implementation, and impact on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, UHC aims to ensure that all people can access necessary health services without financial hardship. However, the pursuit of UHC in Africa has been partial, and its implementation has been hampered by conflicting interests and contested interpretations.\n\nBy adopting a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, this project will investigate the dynamics between actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, with a focus on three African countries. The research will examine the relations between states and citizens, formal systems of social protection, informal social networks supporting health, and the influence of national histories and social practices on UHC implementation.\n\nThis project seeks to contribute to new research directions on UHC and its relevance beyond Africa, providing valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing this policy in diverse contexts. By exploring the complexities of UHC in Africa, this project aims to advance our understanding of the public good and state responsibility in healthcare, ultimately informing more effective and inclusive health policies."
