        "Title: Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours\n\nThis project proposes to revolutionize our understanding of Iron Age populations in Britain and their relationships with continental European neighbours through a pioneering genome-wide ancient DNA analysis. By combining cutting-edge methodologies, including ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological approaches, we aim to investigate key aspects of Iron Age communities.\n\nOur objectives include mapping genetic clusters, addressing population movement, exploring inter-regional connectivity, examining social dynamics, investigating household compositions, identifying familial relationships, analyzing gender-specific mobility, and studying the development of social inequalities. Focusing on Britain within the broader European context, we will analyze 1000 individuals from the UK, complemented by 250 from Europe, spanning the period from 800 BC to AD 100.\n\nAs the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations, this project will yield a new vision of Iron Age communities, shedding light on the complex dynamics of this pivotal period in European history. Our interdisciplinary team brings together expertise in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology, ensuring the highest standards of research and analysis. This project will set a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of human history and migration patterns."
