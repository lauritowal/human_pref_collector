        "Title: STONECULT: Investigating the Origins of Human Culture through Early Stone Tools\n\nAbstract:\n\nSTONECULT is an interdisciplinary research project that aims to investigate the origins of human culture by examining early stone tools. The project seeks to answer the question of when forms of culture first arose in the human lineage, a pressing scientific inquiry that has significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and colonization of the planet. Building on recent advances in comparative psychology and archaeology, we propose to test two hypotheses: that early stone tools do not reflect cumulative culture, and that the latent solutions model provides a more accurate explanation for the development of early stone tool technology.\n\nUsing a combination of top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, we will compare early stone tools to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, providing a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying early hominin technology. The results of this project have the potential to transform our understanding of human culture evolution, informing fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. If confirmed, the latent solutions model will indicate that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, challenging current theories of human cultural development."
