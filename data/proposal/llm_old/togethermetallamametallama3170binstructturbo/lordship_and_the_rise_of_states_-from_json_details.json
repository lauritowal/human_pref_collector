        "Title: Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a new interpretation of state formation in Western Europe between 1300 and 1600, challenging the traditional assumption that centralization was a top-down process driven by princes. Instead, our research hypothesis posits that the decentralization of legal authority played a crucial role in shaping the rise of states. We will investigate the complex interplay between state formation, urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent in five case study regions: Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire.\n\nUsing a path-dependency analytical framework, we will examine the role of local elites in supporting or resisting state centralization, highlighting the existence of 'states within states.' Our project aims to improve our understanding of the social history of power and its development over time.\n\nThis research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of state formation in Western Europe, integrating insights from central and eastern Europe to provide a comprehensive picture of the region's development. The project's methodological innovation will provide a new framework for analyzing the complex dynamics of state formation, challenging existing assumptions and shedding new light on this pivotal period in European history."
