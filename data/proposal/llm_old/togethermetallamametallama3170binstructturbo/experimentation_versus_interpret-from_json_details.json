        "Title: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis artistic research project, hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, seeks to challenge the traditional conception of music performance tied to historical interpretation. By exploring the shift from text-based to performative-based musical works, this project aims to create new paths through experimental performance practices and assess the transferability of scientific experimentation models to music performance.\n\nThrough material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs, this research will investigate the potential of artistic experimentation to drive innovations in theory and practice. The project's outcomes are expected to contribute to the field of musical performance by providing concrete examples of alternative approaches, opportunities for scholarship, and new performance practices.\n\nBy reconfiguring the relationship between music performance and experimentation, this project will offer a radical alternative to traditional 'interpretation' and contribute to a deeper understanding of the possibilities and limitations of artistic research in the twenty-first century. The project's practical components, including theoretical investigation and music practice, will provide a comprehensive framework for exploring the intersection of artistic experimentation and music performance."
