        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management\n\nThe LostInZoom project proposes a novel approach to addressing the challenges of navigating multi-scale interactive maps, particularly in crisis management contexts where efficient information retrieval is critical. Current map design guidelines are inadequate for multi-scale interactive maps, leading to disorientation and confusion among users after zooming interactions. This project will investigate the cognitive processes underlying the use of multi-scale interactive maps, with a focus on identifying visual landmarks that serve as anchors during zooming. Through a combination of experimentation, cartographic generalization technique design, and zooming interaction design, we aim to develop new zooming paradigms that prioritize user orientation and exploration. The project's outcomes will provide valuable insights and guidelines for map designers, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of crisis management operations that rely on multi-scale interactive maps. By improving the usability and accessibility of these maps, we can facilitate more efficient and informed decision-making in high-pressure situations."
