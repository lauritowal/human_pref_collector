        "Title: Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe GLOBECOSAL research project, \"Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period,\" seeks to investigate how artworks were utilized to negotiate spiritual status within post-Tridentine Catholic communities. This project focuses on the production and circulation of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, with a particular emphasis on local constructions of sanctity within the Iberian empires. By analyzing the adherence to Tridentine models of sanctity in artworks, this research aims to challenge existing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach combining critical sociology and art history, this project will employ a global market of symbolic values framework to examine the negotiation of sanctity in artworks. By tracing the circulation of material objects, iconographies, and global networks of knowledge transmission, this research will reveal the significant role artworks played in self-representation and social identity formation in Catholic communities.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the early modern period by globalizing the history of art and highlighting the complex dynamics between the Catholic Church and local communities in the context of Iberian hegemony and the Protestant Reformation."
