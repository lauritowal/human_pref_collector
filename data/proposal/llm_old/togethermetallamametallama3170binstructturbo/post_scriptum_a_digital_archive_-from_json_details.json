        "Title: Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\n\nThis project proposes the systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic study of personal letters written by ordinary individuals in 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain. The archive will feature letters from a diverse range of authors, including servants, children, wives, and others, who wrote to institutions such as the Inquisition and civil courts. By analyzing these letters, the project will provide a well-contextualized study of inter-personal modes of relation and traditional communities. The archive will highlight the oral rhetoric, emotional expressions, and everyday concerns of ordinary people, offering a unique window into the culture and language of the time. The project's output will include a large collection of assembled letters, an online digital edition, and a philological treatment of the texts, adhering to the standards of Textual Criticism. This project aims to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the everyday lives and experiences of ordinary people in early modern Portugal and Spain."
