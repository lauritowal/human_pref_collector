        "Title: The mental economy: testing a dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling (HOMEOSTASIS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe HOMEOSTASIS project proposes a novel theoretical model of working memory, shifting the focus from its limited capacity to its dynamic interaction with the visible world. Current research predominantly explores the maximum capacity of working memory, overlooking its interplay with external sampling. Our hypothesis posits that observers minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature, instead relying on external sampling to maintain perceptual homeostasis.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we will employ novel paradigms that allow for interaction with physically present environments, leveraging electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology. Additionally, we will conduct a patient study involving individuals with restricted deficits to specific components of the model, providing a comprehensive understanding of the proposed internal mental economy. Machine learning applications will be used to discover biometric signatures in eye movements, further validating the model.\n\nThe proposed model has significant implications for understanding working memory disorders and human interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments. By developing a more nuanced understanding of the mental economy, we can improve diagnostic tools and inform the design of more effective virtual reality experiences. The HOMEOSTASIS project aims to revolutionize our understanding of working memory, bridging the gap between internal storage and external sampling."
