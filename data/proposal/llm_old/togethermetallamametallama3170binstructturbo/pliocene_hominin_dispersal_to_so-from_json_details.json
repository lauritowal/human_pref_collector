        "Title: Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to Southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive investigation into the dispersal of Pliocene hominins to southern Africa, leveraging a multifaceted approach that integrates geomorphological, palaeoecological, and anatomical analyses. Focusing on the period from 3.7 million years ago, our research seeks to elucidate the factors contributing to the initial hominin presence in southern Africa. We hypothesize that the expansion and contraction of East African hominin ranges, influenced by wet and dry phases, led to reproductive isolation of southernmost populations, ultimately resulting in the emergence of distinct lineages in southern Africa.\n\nOur investigation will test three key hypotheses: (1) the cyclical expansion and contraction of hominin ranges in East Africa during the Pliocene (>2.6Ma) led to the initial dispersal to southern Africa; (2) the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (~2.6-1.5Ma) modulated dispersal corridors and facilitated intermittent hybridization between East African and southern African hominins; and (3) tectonic and hydrographic changes, including the establishment of the Zambezi River, created a barrier to gene flow after ~1.5Ma, resulting in endemism and ecological niche partitioning among southern African hominins.\n\nBy synthesizing paleoecological, anatomical, and genetic data, this project will provide novel insights into the dynamic processes underlying Pliocene hominin dispersal to southern Africa, shedding light on the complex history of human evolution and adaptation in diverse environments."
