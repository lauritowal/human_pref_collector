        "Title: Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed research project investigates the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas in Europe. The recent rise of far-right parties and growing prejudice towards marginalized groups underscore the need to understand how financial crises contribute to this phenomenon. Despite the timely relevance, existing literature lacks a comprehensive explanation for why economic hardship coincides with increased support for far-right parties.\n\nThis project addresses this knowledge gap by employing a multi-method empirical approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics. Focusing on five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) with varying levels of economic hardship compensation, the study aims to unravel how economic hardship affects support for socially conservative agendas and how policy contexts at local and national levels influence this relationship. By exploring the narratives of loss triggered by economic hardship, this research seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the complexities underlying the surge in far-right ideologies, ultimately informing policies to promote community cohesion and social inclusion."
