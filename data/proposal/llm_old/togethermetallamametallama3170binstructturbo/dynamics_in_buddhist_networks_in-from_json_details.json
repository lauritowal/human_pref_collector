        "Title: Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia by creating a novel framework to analyze the dynamics of Buddhist networks in the region from the 6th to the 14th centuries. By adopting a trans-regional and trans-cultural approach, our research will reconstruct the complex Buddhist network that connected various cultures, including Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan. Through a multidisciplinary methodology combining philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies, we will investigate the localizations of Buddhism in Eastern Central Asia and integrate them into comparative religious studies.\n\nOur project will provide a unique perspective on religious exchange by analyzing it as a dynamic network in spatial and temporal aspects. This approach will enable us to uncover the multi-layered relationships between different cultures and traditions, shedding new light on the mechanisms of cultural and religious transfer. By doing so, our research will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of Eastern Central Asian Buddhism but also offer a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious exchange in other regions and contexts."
