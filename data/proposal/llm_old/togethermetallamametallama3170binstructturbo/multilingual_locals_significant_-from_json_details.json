        "Title: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the field of world literature by challenging the dominant English-centric and monolingual paradigm. Our project, 'Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies,' adopts a multilingual and located approach to explore the complex dynamics of literary production and circulation in diverse cultural contexts. Focusing on north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, we will investigate the intersections of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions during key historical periods, including imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment.\n\nBy examining local transculturations, debates on world literature, and forms of multilingualism, our research aims to develop a theoretical approach that acknowledges the multiplicity of choices and trajectories in literary production. We will also design methods for multilingual training and research, facilitating strategic dialogues between scholars from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France.\n\nThe proposed project critiques the modern literary histories that partition non-Western literature and seeks to move beyond the monolingual straitjacket that has limited our understanding of world literature. Our research will contribute to a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of literary production, ultimately redefining the way we approach and engage with world literature."
