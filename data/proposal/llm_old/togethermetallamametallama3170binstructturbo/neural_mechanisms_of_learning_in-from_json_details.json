        "Title: Neural Mechanisms of Learning in the Infant Brain: From Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying infant learning, with a specific focus on the development of language and complex social interactions. Our research aims to investigate the emergence of human cerebral architecture and its access to a rich symbolic system, from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. We will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optical topography to probe the neural bases of infant learning.\n\nOur proposed project consists of six work packages, each addressing distinct aspects of infant learning. These include the development of statistical inferences, the impact of pre-term environments on early statistical computations, the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, and the identification of infant symbolic competency criteria. Additionally, we will use MRI to localize functional brain areas and track maturational markers, and develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis.\n\nBy clarifying the specificities of a neural functional architecture critical for human learning, our research will provide fundamental insights into the early stages of cognitive development, shedding light on the intricate relationships between brain, language, and social interaction. The proposed project has significant implications for our understanding of human learning and development, and will contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for early childhood disorders."
