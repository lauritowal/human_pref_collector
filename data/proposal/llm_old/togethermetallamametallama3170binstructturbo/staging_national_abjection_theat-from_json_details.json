        "Title: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis transdisciplinary research project examines the intersections of theatre, national identity, and politics in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a combination of theoretical and ethnographic research methods, this study will investigate the role of theatre in shaping and challenging the notion of 'the Turkish nation' and its Others. The project focuses on five case studies, each highlighting a distinct aspect of national abjection and the politics of belonging: Armenian theatre after the Genocide, queer dramas, Islamic theatre, Sephardic Jewish theatre, and Alevi theatre.\n\nThe research objectives are multifaceted: to analyze the constitution of the Turkish nation and its Others through theatre; to provide insights into the contemporary Turkish theatre scene under a conservative neoliberal government; to explore the relationship between artistic performance and everyday citizenship; and to advance understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe. By examining the cultural politics of post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies, this project will shed light on the complex dynamics of national identity, politics, and performance. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of theatre in shaping and challenging dominant narratives of national belonging."
