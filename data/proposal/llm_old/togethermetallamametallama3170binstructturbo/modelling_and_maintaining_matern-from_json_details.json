        "Title: Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health: The HealthyMom Project\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe HealthyMom project proposes a comprehensive, interdisciplinary investigation into the impact of pregnancy loss on maternal mental health. By combining longitudinal data collection, multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry, we aim to identify the neural and genetic factors underlying maternal mental health vulnerability following early miscarriage or stillbirth. Our objectives are fourfold: (1) to study the effects of unwanted terminated pregnancy on the female brain, (2) to understand the reversal of motherhood-associated changes in brain anatomy and function after pregnancy loss, (3) to identify the determinants of afflicted mental health post-pregnancy loss, and (4) to uncover the relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors for mental health maintenance.\n\nThis project will provide critical insights into female-specific brain dynamics and reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability. The expected outcomes will have significant implications for women's health and, indirectly, for the health of future offspring. By identifying targets for maintaining maternal mental health, the HealthyMom project will contribute to the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies, ultimately improving the lives of women and their families."
