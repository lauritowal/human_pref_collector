        "Title: Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the way historians create, curate, and analyze digital data on historical phenomena, with a specific focus on the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095). The project, \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aims to develop and test novel methodologies for reframing historical data as assertions linked to authoritative sources, enabling the manipulation and linking of these assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict.\n\nBy acknowledging the complexity of pre-modern history, characterized by few undisputed facts, this project addresses the challenge of contextualizing and reusing existing online data to prevent waste. Focusing on the eastern half of Christendom, with additional attention to newly Christianized kingdoms in central Europe, this research will examine trans-regional trends often obscured by regional narratives.\n\nDrawing on a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, the project aims to provide a nuanced, multi-perspective understanding of historical events. By developing a traceable authority framework, this research will enable historians to view history from diverse vantage points, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the past.\n\nThe proposed project has significant implications for the field of medieval history, offering new insights into the complex dynamics of eastern Christendom and central Europe during the late 11th century. By providing innovative methodologies for digital data curation and analysis, this project will contribute to the advancement of historical research and have a lasting impact on the field."
