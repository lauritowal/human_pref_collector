        "Title: PRILA - Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe PRILA project seeks to bridge the research gap in understanding the complex interplay of power dynamics, rights, and accountability in European prisons. This interdisciplinary study will explore the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies, examining how mechanisms for securing rights and upholding the rule of law are perceived and implemented. Through a mixed-methods approach combining legal, qualitative, and quantitative research, PRILA will investigate the structures and processes that underpin fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making, as well as appeal and review processes.\n\nBy shedding light on the lived experiences of those within the prison system, PRILA aims to transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advance judicial review of administrative action, and enhance understanding of penal power experiences. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, ultimately supporting better penal policies and practices that protect the rights and dignity of prisoners.\n\nWith a focus on the European experience of penal concepts, PRILA offers a distinctive perspective on the intricate relationships between power, law, and rights in prisons. The project's outcomes will have significant implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to promote just imprisonment, good order, and human rights in the prison system."
