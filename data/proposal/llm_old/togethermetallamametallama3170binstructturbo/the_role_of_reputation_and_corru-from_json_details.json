        "Title: The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement: A Multi-Sectoral Analysis\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project examining the interplay between reputation and corruption in procurement across multiple sectors, including defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The study aims to advance our understanding of these critical factors and their impact on public procurement outcomes, with a focus on avoiding waste, enhancing social welfare, preventing corruption, and ensuring contractor compliance.\n\nThrough three empirical projects, this research will investigate the use of reputation in contract procurement, corruption in public procurement, and the effectiveness of healthcare procurement regulations. The first project will assess the impact of vendor rating systems on contractor performance, procurement costs, corruption concerns, and new bidder entry. The second project will analyze the extent of criminal networks in procurement, the effectiveness of awarding rules in preventing corruption, and develop corruption detection tests. The third project will conduct a descriptive analysis of EU healthcare procurement practices, evaluate the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, and assess the effects on patients' welfare.\n\nThis research has significant implications for policy and practice, providing insights into the design of effective procurement systems that promote transparency, accountability, and social welfare. The findings of this study will inform the development of more efficient and equitable procurement practices, ultimately contributing to better public services and outcomes."
