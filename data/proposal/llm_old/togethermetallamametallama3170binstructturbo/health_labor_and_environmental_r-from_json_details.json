        "Title: Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between environmental quality, health, labor, and policy-making in post-industrial Europe. The project addresses two pressing concerns: global climate change and the increasing demand for environmental quality. By focusing on the combustion of fossil fuels as a primary source of regulated pollution, this research aims to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making, particularly in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management.\n\nThe proposed project is divided into two main parts. Part I will examine the economic implications of local air quality changes resulting from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, while Part II will investigate the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. This interdisciplinary approach will integrate causal inference on pollution emissions with chemical transport models, and incorporate subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include the development of novel tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, which will contribute significantly to addressing global environmental problems and informing policy focus. With its large potential impact, this research has the capacity to shape environmental policy-making and contribute to a more sustainable future for post-industrial Europe."
