        "Title: Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of China's urban governance model, addressing both theoretical and policy challenges in the context of its world-historical significance. By adopting a multi-scalar approach, investigating neighbourhoods, cities, and regions, we will employ ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and collaborative engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers to uncover the intricacies of China's urban transformation.\n\nCase studies in Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area will span coastal, central, and western regions, encompassing recent national strategic projects. This research is particularly timely, given the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and ongoing trade tensions.\n\nThe project aims to contribute to theory by developing the concept of entrepreneurial urban governance and offer an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. Outputs will include six workshops and a publication series, ultimately providing a grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China and transforming our understanding of the country and its governance."
