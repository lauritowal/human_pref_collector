        "Title: The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project proposes to investigate the influence of the international right to housing on national legal discourse through the analysis of eviction litigation cases in Europe. Leveraging data science techniques, we aim to examine the intersection of international and national law in the context of the European financial crisis (2007-2011), which resulted in approximately 700,000 evictions.\n\nBy applying data-driven analysis methods, including citation network analysis and machine learning, to a comprehensive dataset of national supreme courts and lower-level courts, we seek to identify predictors of court decisions and empirically assess the impact of international law on national judicial outcomes. Our research will conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights, shedding light on the complex interactions between international and national legal frameworks.\n\nThe proposed study has significant potential outcomes, including the identification of predictors of court decisions and the development of a research framework applicable to future projects in other areas of the law. By enhancing our understanding of the interplay between international and national law in the context of the right to housing, this research will contribute to the advancement of human rights and inform policy-making in the field of housing and tenancy law."
