        "Title: Energy and Emissions Thresholds for Providing Decent Living Standards to All\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project aims to quantify energy needs and climate change impacts for providing decent living standards to all, focusing on five emerging economies. We will operationalize basic needs views of human development and empirically validate the characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. Using lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modeling, we will quantify energy needs and climate-related emissions for decent living constituents, considering factors such as culture, climate, technology, and other contextual conditions.\n\nOur objectives are to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts of energy use, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and inform burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. By analyzing path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity, we will provide insights into the challenges and opportunities for sustainable development.\n\nThis project will contribute to a better understanding of the energy and emissions thresholds required to achieve decent living standards, ultimately informing policy decisions and international agreements on climate change mitigation and sustainable development."
