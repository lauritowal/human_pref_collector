        "Title: Reframing the History of Welfare and Social Care in European Borderlands, 1870s-1990s\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, \"Social politics in European borderlands: A comparative and transnational study, 1870s-1990s,\" seeks to challenge conventional narratives on the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe. By focusing on the border regions of Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German borders, this study will investigate the contributions of local actors in the co-construction of welfare systems and the interactions between public and private actors in shaping local welfare structures. Through a comparative and transnational approach, this project will examine the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, the competition between social providers, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders.\n\nBy exploring the intersection of national and non-national identities and solidarities in the context of local welfare provision, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex social politics that have shaped European borderlands over the past century. The anticipated outcomes of this project will inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address pressing social rights issues in Europe, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe."
