        "Title: Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project undertakes a comprehensive examination of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism, a formative yet understudied component in the development of social science. By analyzing a diverse corpus of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, this research will shed new light on the representational techniques, epistemic connections, and socio-spatial contexts that underpinned sociographic journalism.\n\nEmploying anthropological and historiographical approaches, this project will investigate the intricate relationships between sociographic journalism and the emergence of academic disciplines, artistic projects, and governmental initiatives. It will also situate journalistic sketches within the broader context of urbanization, cultural transfer, and nation-building.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a co-edited volume, and two monographs. By recovering the significance of sociographic journalism in the formation of ethnographic and sociological knowledge, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex intersections between journalism, social science, and culture in the nineteenth century."
