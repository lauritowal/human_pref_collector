        "Title: In praise of community: Shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, 'In praise of community: shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979)', aims to investigate the role of commonality practices in shaping the performing arts in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. Focusing on artist collaborations and the concept of 'will-to-the-common', this study seeks to contextualize and analyze the significance of artistic communities in Italy during this period, both locally and internationally. The project will draw on historical, philosophical, artistic, sociological, and social network theory perspectives to develop a comprehensive approach to collecting, digitalizing, restoring, and disseminating the works of Italian performing artists.\n\nThe proposed research will employ innovative methodologies, including new models for performing arts knowledge and interpretation, and digital archive visualization. The expected outcomes include the creation of a digital archive of Italian artists' performances and the preservation of Italy's performing arts heritage. By exploring the intersections between art, politics, and community, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of commonality in shaping artistic expression and cultural identity."
