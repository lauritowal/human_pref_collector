        "Title: Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Transoceanic Fishers,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of fishers as mobile maritime actors, challenging the prevailing assumption that they are mere instruments of state agendas. Focusing on the South China Sea, the project investigates the transoceanic expansion of fishing practices, exploring the multiple mobilities of fishers from China, Vietnam, Africa, and Oceania. By employing a novel theoretical and methodological framework that incorporates radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, relational and shifting multiple mobilities, and thalassographic analysis, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics shaping the fishing industry.\n\nThrough fine-grained ethnography, the project will examine the experiences of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, identifying the key nodal points of shore-based activities that drive the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. This research will yield significant scientific and policy value, informing more effective management and conservation strategies for the world's oceans. By redefining fishers as mobile, maritime actors, \"Transoceanic Fishers\" will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness of human and oceanic systems."
