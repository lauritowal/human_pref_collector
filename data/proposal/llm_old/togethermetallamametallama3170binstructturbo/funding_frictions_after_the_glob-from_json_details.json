        "Title: Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis: Investigating the Impact on Financing Conditions and Informing Policy Responses\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and subsequent market turmoil in March 2020 have underscored the significance of funding frictions in exacerbating financial instability. This project seeks to investigate how funding frictions have affected financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies post-GFC. By examining the impact of market developments, such as ballooning deficits in developed economies, tighter regulation, and pension risk transfers, this research will gain a deeper understanding of funding frictions and their manifestations, including elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and limited credit market access.\n\nThe project aims to address critical research questions, including the effect of market developments on funding frictions and their implications for financing conditions. Expected outcomes include insights on funding costs and credit market access, informed debt management strategies for sovereigns, and increased policy maker awareness of regulatory consequences. By providing evidence-based guidance for policy makers, this research will contribute to the optimization of policy responses and the reduction of funding risk for institutions, ultimately promoting financial stability and resilience. This project will shed light on the complex interactions between funding frictions, financing conditions, and regulatory environments, informing the development of effective policy interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of funding frictions."
