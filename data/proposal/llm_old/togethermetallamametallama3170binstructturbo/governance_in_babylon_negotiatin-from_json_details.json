        "Title: Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, 'Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires,' seeks to investigate the dynamics of governance in ancient Babylon under the successive rule of the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian empires from the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC. The proposed study, GoviB, will examine how local actors in Babylon negotiated imperial rule and how rulers employed various strategies to achieve stability or exacerbate instability. Despite incomplete and ambivalent historical data, this research aims to develop a nuanced understanding of politics and authority in ancient Babylon, evaluate the role of successive empires in shaping cultural transformation, and challenge modern perceptions of 'oriental governance' and regime stability.\n\nUsing a governance studies conceptual framework, this project will analyze Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological materials from German excavations in Babylon, and museum collections at the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin. By shedding light on the complex interactions between imperial powers and local actors in ancient Babylon, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of governance in ancient societies and provide valuable insights for contemporary discussions on governance, authority, and cultural transformation."
