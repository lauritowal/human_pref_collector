        "Title: Decolonising Madness? Transcultural Psychiatry, International Order, and the Birth of a Global Psyche in the Aftermath of the Second World War\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a historical and interdisciplinary project examining the emergence of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry concepts in the aftermath of the Second World War and during the decolonisation era. Through a critical analysis of colonial and post-colonial roots of global mental health, this research aims to investigate the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health notions, provide a systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry, and define universal psychological mechanisms.\n\nBy engaging with experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe, this project seeks to foster an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities. Key research questions include how culture, race, and individual psyche were re-defined post-WWII and post-colonialism, the role of non-Western experts in this process, and whether the new global and transcultural psychiatry departed from colonial frameworks.\n\nExpected outcomes of this project include new cross-cultural models of the mind, a redefinition of universal psychological mechanisms, and a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between culture, power, and mental health. By shedding light on the historical and cultural context of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry, this project aims to contribute to a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of mental health and its global applications."
