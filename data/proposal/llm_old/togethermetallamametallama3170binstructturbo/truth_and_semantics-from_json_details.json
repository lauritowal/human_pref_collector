        "Title: Truth and Semantics: A Unified Perspective on Natural Language Semantics and Self-Applicable Truth\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Truth and Semantics,\" seeks to develop a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the complex relationship between truth and natural language semantics. Our research will unify two distinct but interconnected areas of inquiry: truth-conditional semantics and the study of semantic paradoxes in the form of theories of self-applicable truth. \n\nThe project is divided into two main parts: \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics.\" The first part aims to develop novel semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, focusing on the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. The second part adopts a metasemantic perspective to investigate the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to provide the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, which will significantly advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between truth, semantics, and the foundations of natural language. The expected outcome of this project will be a deeper understanding of the nature of truth and its role in shaping our understanding of natural language, ultimately contributing to the development of more comprehensive and accurate semantic theories."
