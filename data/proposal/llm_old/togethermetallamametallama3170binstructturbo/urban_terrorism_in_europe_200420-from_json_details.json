        "Title: Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" seeks to investigate the complex dynamics of memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in Europe. Focusing on the aftermath of more than ten terrorist attacks in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany between 2004 and 2019, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries, this project will employ a multifaceted approach, integrating memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining after attacks; develop a new materialist approach to terrorism; assess existing policies and security infrastructures; and explore alternative forms of remembering and future visions through performance art. The project will produce a range of outputs, including a website featuring interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and public performances in collaboration with the Center for Political Beauty.\n\nBy providing the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent urban terrorism in Europe, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between terrorism, memory, and security. The findings of this research will inform the development of more effective policies and strategies for mitigating the impact of terrorism and promoting a more resilient and responsive society."
