        "Title: Florilegia Syriaca: Unveiling the Intercultural Dissemination of Greek Christian Thought in Syriac and Arabic in the First Millennium CE\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, \"Florilegia Syriaca,\" proposes to illuminate the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic during the first millennium CE. By examining the cultural mediation of Syriac Christianity, our research aims to address a significant knowledge gap in understanding the dissemination of Christian ideas in the Late Antique period. Through the creation of open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia (anthologies) and a comprehensive study of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors, this project seeks to shed light on the complex dynamics of cultural exchange and the formation of religious identities.\n\nOur research objectives include defining the religious identity of Syriac Christians, analyzing the cultural creativity laboratories of Syriac florilegia, and investigating the shared intellectual heritage of European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures. By producing groundbreaking digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th-10th centuries and studying neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors, this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity and the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge between intellectual history of Europe and the Middle East. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper comprehension of Europe's current religious discourses and the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians."
