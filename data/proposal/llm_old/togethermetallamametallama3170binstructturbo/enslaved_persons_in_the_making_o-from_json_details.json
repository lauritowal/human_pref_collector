        "Title: SLaVEgents: Unveiling the Agency of Enslaved Persons in Ancient Western Eurasia and Africa\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, SLaVEgents, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the role of enslaved persons in shaping ancient societies and cultures in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By focusing on slave agency, our team of 19 researchers will analyze the complex identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals and their significant influence on historical changes.\n\nThrough the lens of Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin languages, we will create a comprehensive digital prosopography of enslaved persons, shedding light on their lives, interactions, and impacts on ancient societies. Our research outputs will include a monograph, two collective volumes, 15 articles, three PhD dissertations, and a project website. We will also organize three workshops and an international conference to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\nBy recentering the narratives of enslaved persons, SLaVEgents aims to challenge prevailing historical accounts and provide a more nuanced understanding of the ancient world. Our project has the potential to transform the field of ancient history, shedding new light on the agency and contributions of enslaved individuals in shaping the course of human history."
