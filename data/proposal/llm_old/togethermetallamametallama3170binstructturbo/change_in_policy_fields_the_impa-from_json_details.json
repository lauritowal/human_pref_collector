        "Title: Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed project seeks to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies across 25 OECD countries from 1980 to 2010. The study aims to identify patterns of change in policy fields, comparing morality policies over time and across countries, as well as examining variations within policy subfields such as life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances and behavior. \n\nA macro-quantitative analysis of legislative output data will be conducted to identify trends and patterns, supplemented by qualitative case studies of critical cases selected based on the quantitative findings. This mixed-methods approach will enable a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between international and domestic factors influencing morality policy development.\n\nBy examining the dynamics of morality policy change over three decades, this project will contribute to our understanding of the interplay between domestic and international factors in shaping policy fields. The findings will inform policymakers, scholars, and the broader public, providing valuable insights into the evolution of morality policies and their implications for societal values and norms."
