        "Title: Between Canon and Coincidence: Unveiling Art World Patterns in Ethnographic and Archaeological Collections (BECACO)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, BECACO, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections by applying data-driven approaches to the study of Art Worlds. Building on Howard Becker's concept of Art Worlds (2008[1982]), our research will reconceptualize provenance as a large-scale examination of the socio-politico-historical contexts that have led to the translocation of cultural material. Focusing on Indigenous Latin American material, we will analyze a vast corpus of provenance data from 12 museums across 9 countries in Europe, spanning the period from 1850 to 2000. Employing quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining methodologies, our study will uncover patterns and connections that have shaped the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe. By developing new models for provenance research and advancing conceptual and methodological frameworks, BECACO aims to contribute significantly to the field of art history and cultural heritage studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the complex dynamics that have influenced the creation and circulation of cultural artifacts."
