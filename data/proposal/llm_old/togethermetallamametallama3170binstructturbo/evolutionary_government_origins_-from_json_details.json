        "Title: Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government (STATE-DNA Project)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the STATE-DNA project, a pioneering research initiative that explores the evolution of government structures and their impact on policy. Building on the theoretical framework of Evolutionary Government, this study aims to address two fundamental questions: why do government structures change, and how does structural change affect government policy? To answer these questions, we will analyze a comprehensive dataset of approximately 150,000 units within ministries and agencies across six countries, spanning from 1815 to 2025.\n\nBy employing innovative methodologies, including genetic measures for assessing structural change and data assimilation techniques borrowed from biology, we will investigate the complex interactions between structural features and organizational/environmental environments that drive government transformation. Our expected outcomes include a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy, a predictive forecasting model for future changes, and the creation of a comprehensive dataset of government structures since the early 19th century.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to our understanding of government evolution, shedding light on the consequences of structural change and informing policy decisions. Ultimately, the STATE-DNA project will provide a robust framework for understanding the dynamics of government transformation, enabling policymakers to make more informed decisions about the future of governance."
