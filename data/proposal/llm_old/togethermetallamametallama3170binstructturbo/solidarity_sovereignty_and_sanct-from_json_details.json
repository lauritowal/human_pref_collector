        "Title: Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to explore the complex interplay between notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping the experiences of boat refugees across the globe since the 1940s. Focusing on four key periods and regions, including the Mediterranean (1940s), the South China Sea (1970s-80s), the Caribbean (1980s-90s), and the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean (1990s-2000s), this research aims to understand how these concepts influenced the reception and treatment of over 1 million boat refugees during these timeframes.\n\nThrough a comparative and transnational approach, this project will examine the relationships between state and non-state actors, as well as the dynamics of solidarity onboard and during encounters with external parties. Key research questions include: Who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, and why? How did states respond to the arrival of boat refugees, and what were the outcomes for those seeking sanctuary?\n\nDrawing on a diverse range of sources, including interviews with boat refugees and state and non-state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical patterns and global dynamics of boat refugee movements. By \"thinking through seas\" and moving beyond state-centric approaches, this research will provide new insights into the complex and often fraught relationships between solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in the context of refugee movements."
