        "Title: The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study proposes to investigate the causal effects of various public policies and income shocks on child health and human capital development in Spain. Leveraging 35 years of administrative data, this project applies cutting-edge econometric techniques to assess the impact of different interventions on child outcomes from birth to age 15. Specifically, we focus on the 'missing middle' period, a critical phase of child development where existing research is scarce. Our analysis will examine the effects of household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks on child health, hospital and primary care records, school grades, and standardized test scores.\n\nGuided by the fetal origins hypothesis, this study aims to identify the key channels through which policy interventions influence child development, including family size, parental time use, and labor market outcomes. The findings of this research will have important policy implications, providing insights into effective interventions that can improve child health and human capital outcomes. By shedding light on the causal relationships between policy, income, and child development, this project will contribute to the development of evidence-based policies that promote the well-being of children in Spain and beyond."
