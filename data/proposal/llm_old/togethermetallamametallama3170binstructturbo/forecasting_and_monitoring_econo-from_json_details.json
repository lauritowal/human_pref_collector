        "Abstract: \n\nTitle: Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators\n\nThis ERC Proof of Concept grant proposal seeks to develop a cutting-edge software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring key economic indicators in real-time. Building upon the foundational work conducted under the ERC-2007-StG grant \"Change-Point Tests\", our project aims to create a novel model family that integrates high-frequency information and predictive breakdown tests to enhance the accuracy and reliability of economic forecasts.\n\nOur proposed toolbox will address the limitations of current software by providing real-time monitoring capabilities and predictive breakdown tests, thereby enabling more informed decision-making among governments, Central Banks, and firms. The software will feature a user-friendly interface, three-dimensional graphical representation, and accessibility to decision makers.\n\nBy improving economic forecasts, our project aims to contribute to prudent economic policy, foster economic growth, and ultimately enhance economic and social welfare. Established collaborations with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank will facilitate the development and testing of our software. Upon successful completion, our project will provide a valuable tool for policymakers and stakeholders, enabling them to make more informed decisions in an increasingly complex economic landscape."
