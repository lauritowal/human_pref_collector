        "Title: Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, TransCorr, seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe during the transformative period of 1750-1850. By examining the intersection of politics, culture, and economy, we aim to understand how perceptions of corruption evolved over time, particularly in the context of foreign interventions and the rise of modernity. A multidisciplinary approach will be employed to analyze the assessments of foreign observers and indigenous critics, revealing the complex motivations and claims that shaped the notion of corruption in the region.\n\nOur research objectives include tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes surrounding corruption, reframing debates on patronage and graft, and demonstrating the reframing of customs as corrupt. By aligning historiography with scientific innovations and engaging in a dialogue with global modernization, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of center-periphery relations and the cultural and economic underpinnings of corruption in the region. The proposed project will provide a nuanced understanding of the historical roots of corruption in Central-South-East Europe, shedding light on the complex dynamics that have shaped the region's development over time."
