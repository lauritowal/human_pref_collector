        "Title: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe project (LostMa) seeks to revolutionize our understanding of human cultural evolution through the transmission of written artefacts. By combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise, this interdisciplinary project aims to model the dynamics of manuscript text transmission in medieval Europe. Focusing on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, LostMa will analyze the copying, transformation, and destruction of texts, shedding light on the role of chance and human agency in cultural transmission.\n\nThrough a case study of chivalric literature in European context, LostMa will investigate the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons across Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages. Employing stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection, the project will examine the transmission of texts as a process akin to the evolution of organisms or language variants. By analyzing a vast corpus of 4000 documents, LostMa will provide novel insights into the complex interplay between human culture, language, and the written word.\n\nThe project's findings will have far-reaching implications for our understanding of cultural transmission, manuscript studies, and the evolution of human knowledge. By uncovering the hidden patterns and mechanisms governing the transmission of texts, LostMa will contribute significantly to the field of cultural evolution and shed new light on the medieval manuscript tradition."
