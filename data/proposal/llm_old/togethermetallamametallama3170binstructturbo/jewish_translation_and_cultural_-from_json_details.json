        "Title: Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to redefine our understanding of Jewish modernization in early modern Europe by examining the pivotal role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages. Challenging the conventional narrative of a radical break with tradition, this research instead reveals the dynamic process of cultural transfer and intercultural dialogue between Christians and Jews during this period. By conducting the first comprehensive study of these translations, this project aims to uncover the active engagement of Jewish translators with their sources, resulting in a distinctly Jewish corpus that interacted with majority culture.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, this project will analyze the translations, their contexts, and their impact on Jewish culture, providing new insights into the early modern 'Jewish book' and Jewish modernization. By shedding light on these intercultural encounters, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of Jewish identity and cultural exchange during a transformative period in European history. Ultimately, this project will offer a new paradigm for understanding the intersections of Jewish and non-Jewish cultures in early modern Europe, with significant implications for the fields of Jewish studies, translation studies, and early modern European history."
