        "Title: Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to bridge the gap between brain and mind by developing and delivering neurocomputational models that integrate systems-level neuroanatomy and function with detailed cognitive behavior. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, our proposal aims to understand the nature of mental processes, their neural underpinnings, and the basis of impairments in neurological patients. To achieve this, we will investigate complex mental behaviors and underlying cognitive processes, map neural systems and their function, and develop innovative methods and tools to bridge brain and mental behavior.\n\nOur approach combines experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies to create a new type of neurocomputational model that can mimic normal and impaired behavior, connecting neuroanatomy and cognition. By converging multiple methods and forcing a convergence of results, we aim to secure a systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. Our goals include developing a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition, planning and executing neuroscience and cognitive methods simultaneously, and providing a robust framework for improving clinical management and treatment of neurological patients. Ultimately, our project seeks to advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between brain, mind, and behavior, with significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders."
