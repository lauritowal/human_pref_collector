        "Title: Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction (MADVIS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, MADVIS, aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal plasticity in the occipital cortex following visual deprivation at different developmental stages. By employing a combination of cognitive neuroscience and ophthalmological methods, we will investigate how specific brain regions adapt their function in the absence of visual input and leverage this understanding to predict outcomes of sight restoration.\n\nOur objectives are twofold: (1) to understand the effects of visual deprivation on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex, and (2) to use this knowledge to develop predictive models for sight restoration outcomes. We anticipate that this research will have a significant impact on our understanding of experience-dependent brain development, bridge the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, and lead to the development of new predictive tools for sensory restoration procedures. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the advancement of our knowledge on brain plasticity and inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for visual disorders."
