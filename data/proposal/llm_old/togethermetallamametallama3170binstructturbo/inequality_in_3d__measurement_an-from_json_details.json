        "Title: Inequality in 3D – Measurement and Implications for Macroeconomic Theory\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, \"Inequality in 3D – Measurement and Implications for Macroeconomic Theory,\" aims to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between economic inequality and macroeconomic outcomes. By measuring the economy at the household level across three dimensions (consumption, income, and wealth), this study seeks to quantify micro-level heterogeneity that has significant implications for macroeconomic theory. Leveraging novel microdata and heterogeneous agent models, our research will contrast traditional representative agent models to provide a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy.\n\nExpected outcomes of this project include informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing novel insights for fiscal and monetary policy improvements, and shedding light on the ongoing debate on economic inequality. Our findings will offer valuable lessons to policymakers, enabling them to better address economic inequality and its far-reaching consequences. By bridging the gap between micro and macroeconomic analysis, this project has the potential to shape a more informed and effective policy response to the pressing issue of economic inequality."
