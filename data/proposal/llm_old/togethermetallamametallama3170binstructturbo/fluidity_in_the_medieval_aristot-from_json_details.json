        "Title: Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support a comprehensive investigation into the ways medieval readers engaged with the Latin translations of Aristotle's works, particularly during the 12th and 13th centuries. By examining hundreds of manuscripts containing Greek-Latin translations, our research aims to document variant readings and shed light on the textual fluidity that characterized the transmission of these influential texts. We will focus on three critical treatises: De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo.\n\nOur research will contribute to the fields of philosophy, science, and theology by demonstrating how the Latin translations of Aristotle's works diverged from the Greek originals and how these variations impacted the understanding of his ideas during the late medieval and early modern periods. Through a meticulous examination of manuscript witnesses, we will develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science, providing new insights into the complex dynamics of textual transmission and the ways in which readers interacted with these texts.\n\nBy exploring the textual fluidity of medieval Aristotle manuscripts, this project will not only advance our understanding of the medieval reception of Aristotle's works but also provide a nuanced perspective on the evolution of philosophical and scientific thought in Europe. We believe that this research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of the intellectual history of the Western world."
