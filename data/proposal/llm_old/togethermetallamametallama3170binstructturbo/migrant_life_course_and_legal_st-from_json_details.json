        "Title: Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, 'Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition,' aims to investigate the complex relationship between citizenship acquisition and migrant integration, with a focus on the impact of policy variations on legal status transitions and integration outcomes. By modeling migrants' legal status transitions as life course events, this study seeks to analyze the relevance of citizenship for various aspects of migrant life, including employment, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment.\n\nUsing longitudinal register-based micro-data and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries, this project will develop and test innovative methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact. The target population includes immigrants and their children, providing a comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects of citizenship acquisition.\n\nThis research has significant policy implications, as it aims to inform targeted citizenship policies that maximize settlement success. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between migrant integration, policy variations, and citizenship acquisition, ultimately enhancing the development of effective integration strategies."
