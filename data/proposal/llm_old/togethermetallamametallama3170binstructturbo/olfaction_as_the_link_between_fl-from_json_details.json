        "Title: Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, OLFLINK, aims to revolutionize our understanding of how flavor preferences are formed and retrieved during food consumption, ultimately driving dietary changes for global health and sustainability. Our goal is to overcome the barrier of familiar food flavor preferences, which are shaped by odor-taste associative learning. However, the cortical processes underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully understood.\n\nOLFLINK will address this knowledge gap by investigating the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (CODE), the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations (CONTROL), and the interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (REGULATE). These three objectives will be explored across three nested levels of investigation, providing a comprehensive understanding of the biological basis of flavor preference formation and retrieval.\n\nThe outcomes of OLFLINK will have significant impacts, including the development of novel interventions for dietary changes across the lifespan, the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, and a deeper understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns. By uncovering the processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth, OLFLINK will pave the way for a new generation of evidence-based strategies to promote healthier eating habits and mitigate the global health burden associated with malnutrition."
