        "Title: It Takes a Village: An Interdisciplinary Community Neuroscience Approach to Characterize Multigenerational Interactions\n\nAbstract:\n\nEffective communication across generations is crucial in fostering social cohesion and bridging intergenerational gaps. However, little is known about the complex dynamics of multigenerational interactions. This project, InterCom, proposes an innovative, interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to investigate these interactions within and beyond family contexts. By combining laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal and interpersonal measures, we aim to understand how age-related differences in brain rhythms, speech processing, and predictive abilities influence conversational flow and intergenerational miscommunications.\n\nOur objectives are to integrate laboratory and real-world data collection, and to develop stimuli and analyze data in a reciprocal manner between lab and real-world settings. We will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during co-designed storytelling events with community partners. Our goals are to gain a deeper understanding of multigenerational communication and to generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations. By testing a novel community neuroscience approach, we will leverage the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and connected society."
