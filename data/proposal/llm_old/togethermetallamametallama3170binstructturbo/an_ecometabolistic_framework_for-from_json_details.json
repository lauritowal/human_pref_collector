        "Title: An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe global crisis of material depletion necessitates a paradigm shift in sustainable building practices, focusing on the adoption of bio-based materials in architecture. However, this transition poses several challenges, including the representation, conceptualization, operationalization, and value proposition of bio-based materials. This project proposes an eco-metabolistic framework to address these challenges and foster sustainable architecture.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary research-by-design approach, this project will investigate the use of glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria in sustainable building design. Advanced computational modelling networks, including predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing, will be employed to optimize design solutions. The project aims to achieve carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions, while redefining traditional design agency through the concept of continual construction beyond building completion.\n\nBy challenging conventional practices and promoting participatory, socially conscious, and democratic models of production, this project seeks to revolutionize sustainable architecture and contribute to a more environmentally conscious built environment."
