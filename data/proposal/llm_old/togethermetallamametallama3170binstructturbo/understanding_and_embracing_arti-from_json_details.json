        "Title: F-AI-MILY: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on Family Social Dynamics\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project seeks to investigate the impact of artificial agents on family social dynamics, bridging the knowledge gap between family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. This interdisciplinary study aims to establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to examine the effects of long-term interactions with artificial agents on family neurocognition. Our objectives include describing developmental changes in social dynamics, identifying sustainable interactions that support households with chronic illness, and guiding the development of artificial agents to aid vulnerable families.\n\nUsing a combination of behavioural and brain measures, we will investigate the attitudes and behaviours of family members interacting with artificial agents. Our study will focus on families with children aged 4-12, exploring both short-term and long-term effects of living with artificial agents. By adopting a neurocognition-at-home approach, we aim to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, ultimately transforming maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness. The F-AI-MILY project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human-AI interaction and its impact on family relationships, informing the development of artificial agents that support and enhance family well-being."
