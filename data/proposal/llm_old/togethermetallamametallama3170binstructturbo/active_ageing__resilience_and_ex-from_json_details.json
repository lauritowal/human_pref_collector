        "Title: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop and test novel interventions to promote active ageing in older adults, focusing on the interplay between individual resilience and external support. Guided by the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing, our project will develop a multidimensional scale to assess active ageing across four key dimensions: ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy. We will collect cross-sectional data from a sample of 1000 older adults aged 75-85 and utilize state-of-the-art statistical methods to examine the determinants and modifiers of active ageing.\n\nA randomized controlled trial with 200 participants will test the feasibility and effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention combining counselling, information technology, and volunteer support. Our study will also investigate cohort effects by comparing the current data with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago, providing valuable insights into the long-term dynamics of active ageing.\n\nThis project seeks to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and produce evidence for active ageing promotion. Our expected outcomes include the development of a novel scale for active ageing, training opportunities for young scientists, and the advancement of new concepts and theories in the field. By addressing the complex interplay between individual and environmental factors, our project aims to contribute to the development of effective strategies for promoting active ageing and healthy ageing outcomes."
