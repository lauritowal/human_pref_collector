        "Title: Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability (RICA)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe RICA project seeks to challenge conventional wisdom on regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability by re-examining the fundamental assumptions of the regulatory state. In the face of rising non-majoritarianism, devaluation of the political process, and evolving relationships between accountability and autonomy, this project aims to provide new theoretical frameworks for understanding regulatory governance.\n\nThrough a two-module approach, RICA will investigate the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, hypothesizing that insulation negatively affects credibility. Additionally, it will explore how reputation shapes accountability behavior, developing a novel theory of accountability. Drawing on insights from the political science literature on reputation, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability.\n\nBy addressing key challenges in regulatory governance, RICA will provide policymakers and scholars with a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between regulatory institutions, reputation, and accountability. Ultimately, this project aims to inform the design of more effective and accountable regulatory institutions, promoting better governance in the regulatory state."
