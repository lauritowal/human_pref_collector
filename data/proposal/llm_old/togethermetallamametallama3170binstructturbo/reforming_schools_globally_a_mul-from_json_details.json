        "Abstract: \n\nTitle: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nThe project REFORMED aims to comprehensively analyze the adoption, reformulation, and effects of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector worldwide. In response to the growing trend of global reform pressures, this research seeks to address the dissemination of SAWA policies, policy convergence in education, and the contextual and institutional circumstances surrounding these policies. The study also investigates the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity.\n\nBuilding on the mixed findings from existing research, REFORMED will employ a robust, multi-scalar methodological strategy combining quantitative and qualitative methods to examine SAWA policies from their inception in global agendas (e.g., OECD) to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. The project will focus on institutional frameworks, policy enactment processes, and the actors involved, including international bureaucrats and teachers.\n\nBy examining the effects of SAWA policies at the school level, REFORMED aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between policy adoption, reformulation, and educational outcomes. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights for policymakers, international organizations, and education stakeholders seeking to improve the quality and equity of education worldwide."
