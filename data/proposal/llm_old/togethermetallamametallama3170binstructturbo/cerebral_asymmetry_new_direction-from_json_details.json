        "Title: CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed research project, \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to explore the functional cerebral asymmetry underlying language development and its etiology, 150 years after Paul Broca's pioneering work. Building upon the foundations laid by Broca, our study will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating genetic and neuropsychological methods to investigate the complex relationships between brain lateralization, language development, and cognitive functions.\n\nThe project comprises five interconnected modules: identifying individual differences in language lateralization patterns (Project A), investigating the risk of language and literacy impairment associated with atypical language lateralization (Project B), simulating genetic models to understand the heritability of language lateralization (Project C), testing the \"double hit genetic model\" to explain neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Project D), and searching for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements in individuals with inconsistent language laterality patterns (Project E).\n\nOur central hypothesis, the \"network efficiency hypothesis,\" posits that the brain's lateralization patterns are optimized for efficient language processing. By exploring the correlates and etiology of cerebral asymmetry, this project seeks to shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of language development and its disorders, ultimately informing the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
