        "Title: Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men: An Examination of the Impact of Changing Family and Working Lives\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed research project, \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" aims to address the growing concern of men's premature mortality rates and significant preventable excess mortality. Despite advancements in healthcare, men continue to experience disadvantages in health outcomes, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Our project seeks to improve men's health and cognition by investigating the complex relationships between men's changing family and working lives.\n\nUtilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Norwegian population, we will analyze a large sample of over 12,000 men across various life stages, from late teens to midlife. Our research objectives focus on examining cohort and period differences, the work-family interface, the male breadwinner model, and fathers' participation in childcare. By disentangling selection and causality, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing men's health and cognition.\n\nOur study has significant social implications, including enhancing men's participation in the labor market, extending their potential, and promoting a more equitable distribution of family roles. The expected outcomes of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between men's family and working lives, ultimately informing policies and interventions aimed at improving men's health and cognition."
