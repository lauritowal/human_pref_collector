        "Title: Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an interdisciplinary research project, 'Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,' that aims to conduct a historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). This devastating pandemic, which resulted in an estimated 12 million deaths worldwide, provides a unique lens through which to examine the intersection of technology, culture, and public health.\n\nOur research team, led by a principal investigator and consisting of three full-time postdoctoral researchers, will investigate the influence of photography on the visual representations of the plague pandemic across various regions, including China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America. We will focus on four key aspects of the pandemic: the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses and burial, and the intersection of race, class, and discrimination.\n\nBy analyzing a wide range of visual materials, including photographs, illustrations, and films, our project will provide a nuanced understanding of how the plague pandemic was perceived, experienced, and represented across different cultures and societies. The findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between technology, culture, and public health, and will have implications for the study of global health crises and the role of visual media in shaping public perception."
