        "Title: Unveiling the Medieval Placebo Effect: A Triangular Exploration of Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe (1100-1500)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for \"MedPlaceboEffect,\" a groundbreaking research project that delves into the intricacies of the placebo effect in medieval medicine and healing within Christian Southern Europe between 1100 and 1500. By adopting a triangular approach, our study will examine the interplay between ideas, practices, and organizing structures that shaped the medieval placebo effect, focusing on core concepts such as hope, expectation for cure, belief, trust, and the placebo effect itself.\n\nThe project aims to achieve four primary objectives: identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect, facilitate a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions, demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities, and show the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing. By exploring the historical context of the placebo effect, our research will provide valuable insights into the therapeutic elements of medieval healing, the impact of the soul and mind on health, and lay the foundation for a contemporary examination of healing practices.\n\nUltimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the placebo effect's role in shaping healthcare systems and inform strategies to address distrust in medical services and the challenges of overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, with far-reaching implications for the development of more effective and patient-centered healthcare approaches in the 21st century."
