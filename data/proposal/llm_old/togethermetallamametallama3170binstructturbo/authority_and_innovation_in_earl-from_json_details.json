        "Title: Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by examining the hitherto overlooked innovative contributions of early Franciscan thinkers. Contrary to the prevailing assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past knowledge, this research will demonstrate their groundbreaking role in shaping the trajectory of Western thought. Employing a novel 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach, this study will delve into the interplay between theory and practice in early Franciscan scholasticism, highlighting the influence of Islamic sources and the emergence of a shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity.\n\nThe project's objectives include producing the first comprehensive study of early Franciscan thought, identifying novelty in their work, and drawing connections between early and late Franciscan schools. By re-envisioning the state of the art in the study of scholasticism, this research will provide a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought, showcasing the transformative impact of Franciscan ideas when removed from their original context. The expected outcome of this project is a significant breakthrough in understanding the medieval roots of modern Western philosophy, with far-reaching implications for the fields of philosophy, history, and interfaith dialogue."
