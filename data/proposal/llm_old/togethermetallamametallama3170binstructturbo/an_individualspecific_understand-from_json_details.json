        "Title: An Individual-Specific Understanding of How Synchrony Becomes Curative (SynSig)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe SynSig project challenges the prevailing assumption that higher interpersonal synchrony uniformly leads to improved mental health outcomes. Instead, this research aims to investigate the individual-specific effects of synchrony on mental health, exploring how unique synchrony signatures can be identified, analyzed, and leveraged to foster curative relationships.\n\nUsing multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression) and a novel multimodal feedback system, this study will examine dyadic interactions between humans and virtual humans. By facilitating individual-tailored changes in synchrony, we will draw causal inferences between synchrony adjustments and mental health outcomes.\n\nExpected outcomes of SynSig include evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the complex nature of synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. By developing a personalized approach to synchrony, this project has the potential to inform novel therapeutic strategies and interventions, ultimately promoting more effective and targeted support for mental health. The findings of SynSig will contribute significantly to our understanding of the intricate relationships between interpersonal synchrony, individual differences, and mental well-being."
