        "Title: Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society: Exploring Human-Environment Interaction in the Ancient Near East\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe CLaSS project proposes a comprehensive investigation into the complex dynamics of human-environment interaction in the Fertile Crescent region of the Ancient Near East, spanning 8,000 to 2,000 years Before Present. By leveraging a hybrid research approach that integrates archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data, this project aims to elucidate the factors contributing to the differential persistence of societies under changing climates. Employing cutting-edge techniques in archaeological data science and big data analysis, the project will generate high-resolution empirical datasets to analyze population densities, spatial distribution, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies.\n\nThrough the application of General Circulation Models, this research will explore the impacts of abrupt and longer-term climate changes on the sustainability and resilience of ancient societies. The project's findings will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between climate, landscape, settlement, and society, offering a nuanced understanding of the adaptive capacities of human societies in the face of environmental change. Ultimately, the CLaSS project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human-environment interaction, informing strategies for building sustainable and resilient societies in the face of climate uncertainty."
