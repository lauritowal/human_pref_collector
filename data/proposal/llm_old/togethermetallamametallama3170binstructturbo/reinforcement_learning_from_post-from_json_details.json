        "Title: Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the complex mechanisms underlying food-seeking behavior, with a particular focus on the role of post-ingestive reinforcement and its neural substrates. Our study hypothesizes that food selection is modulated by a dopaminergic substrate and associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach combining computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation in both rodents and humans. \n\nA key aspect of our research will be to elucidate how post-ingestive information about energy content, transmitted through the vagus nerve, influences food choice and consumption patterns. We will also examine the impact of obesity on these processes using human probabilistic decision-making tasks. By elucidating the neural mechanisms governing food-seeking behavior, our study aims to provide novel insights into the development of effective treatments for eating disorders and obesity. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between the body and brain in modulating behavior, with significant implications for public health and clinical practice."
