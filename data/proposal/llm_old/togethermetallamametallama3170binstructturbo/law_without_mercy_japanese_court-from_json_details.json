        "Title: Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes to investigate the role of Japanese courts-martial and military courts during the Asia-Pacific War (1937-1945), shedding light on the intersection of military justice, violence, and legitimacy in a time of conflict. Through a rigorous analysis of original archival sources, this study will examine the purposes and outcomes of these courts, focusing on their use to regulate violence for war goals, deter and coerce civilian populations, and legitimize Japan's war efforts. The research will center on the actions of key actors, including Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy soldiers, in East Asia and Southeast Asia during this period.\n\nBy exploring the routinization and escalation of violence through military justice, this project aims to contribute to our understanding of the Asia-Pacific War and its significance for contemporary humanitarian issues. The findings will provide historical insights into the tensions between military necessity and humanitarian law, informing our comprehension of the complexities of armed conflict and the importance of upholding the rule of law in times of war. Ultimately, this research will enrich our knowledge of modern Japanese history and international law, offering a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between war, violence, and the law."
