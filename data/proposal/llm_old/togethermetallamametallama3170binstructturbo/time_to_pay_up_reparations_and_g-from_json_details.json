        "Title: Time to Pay Up? Reparations and Global Development Challenges (REPAIR)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, REPAIR, seeks to investigate the emerging phenomenon of reparations in global development contexts. As calls for reparations intensify in response to infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments, a comprehensive understanding of these payments is crucial. By comparing and contrasting reparations initiatives across various global development challenges, our research aims to elucidate the economic, moral, and political dimensions of reparations.\n\nThrough a novel comparative social-science approach, REPAIR will analyze how reparations payments are established, implemented, and received, shedding light on the type of wealth transfer they constitute and the \"reparative aspects\" of economic life. By broadening the comparative frame of reparations study and employing innovative theory and methods from economic anthropology, this project will contribute significantly to the field of development studies.\n\nThe proposed research has the potential to inform policy and practice, providing insights into the effectiveness and implications of reparations as a tool for addressing global development challenges. Ultimately, REPAIR seeks to advance our understanding of reparations as a form of wealth transfer and its role in promoting global justice and development."
