        "Title: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe European Commission's prototype digital twin of the ocean (DTO) represents a significant opportunity to transform ocean governance and support sustainable ocean futures. However, the development and use of DTOs are fraught with challenges, including time pressure, persisting data gaps, and the implementation of global sustainability goals for ocean protection. Furthermore, the international deployment of DTOs is susceptible to risks such as perpetuating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe proposed project, TwinPolitics, seeks to address these concerns by examining the socio-technical making of DTOs for national scientific and political purposes and their use in an international setting. Our approach re-conceptualizes digital twins as socio-technical relations and combines qualitative and quantitative research methods to study the practices, policies, and politics of digital twins in the EU, USA, and China. We will also investigate the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations, shedding light on the complex dynamics at play.\n\nBy breaking new ground in the study of digital twins, TwinPolitics aims to provide critical insights into the politics of DTO development and use, ultimately unlocking their full potential to support sustainable ocean futures. This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between technology, politics, and sustainability, and inform evidence-based policy decisions in the field of ocean governance."
