        "Title: Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project investigates the impact of technology on corporate governance, environmental and social (ES) issues, and employee compensation. The study will examine three key areas: communication with shareholders, ES actions, and employee benefits. \n\nThe first pillar of the project will assess whether the shift to virtual-only shareholder meetings has muted shareholders' voices, potentially allowing firms to evade addressing critical questions. Preliminary findings suggest that this shift has indeed minimized communication.\n\nThe second pillar will utilize natural language processing to evaluate the relationship between firms' stated ES actions and actual actions, exploring whether investors prioritize stated intentions or tangible actions. Initial results indicate that market rewards are tied to stated actions rather than actual ES performance.\n\nThe third pillar will investigate the relationship between employee characteristics, specifically in the tech industry, and the Employee Benefits Compensation (EBC) they receive. This research aims to identify whether certain groups, such as women, face disparities in EBC value and the implications for their economic welfare.\n\nThe proposed study aims to provide insights into the intersection of technology, corporate governance, and individual prosperity, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between these factors and informing evidence-based policies to promote equitable economic growth."
