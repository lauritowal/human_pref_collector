        "Title: Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance: Understanding the Organizational Circumstances that Shape AI Adoption\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multi-sited ethnographic study investigates the nuances of human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance. Focusing on the intersection of big data, AI systems, and algorithmic ethics, we aim to fill critical research gaps in understanding the socio-cultural context and organizational collaboration with AI in healthcare decision-making. Our research goals include analyzing moments of human intervention with AI across six national settings, developing a theory on organizational factors for ethical AI, and employing future-scenarioing anthropological methods to connect anthropological insights with AI development. By partnering with health decision-makers and policy institutions, this project seeks to generate empirical evidence of human intervention with AI and its implications for national health policies and individual lives. Our expected outcomes include informing evidence-based national health policies and improving the lives of individuals through responsible AI adoption in healthcare governance. By exploring the complex dynamics of human-AI collaboration, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of how to harness the potential of AI in promoting equitable and effective healthcare systems."
