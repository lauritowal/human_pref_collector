        "Title: Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949\n\nThis multidisciplinary project proposes a comprehensive examination of the cultural landscape in the British and American zones of Occupied Germany between 1945 and 1949. It aims to investigate the cross-fertilisation of Anglo-American and German literature and film, providing a new interpretative framework for post-war culture. By combining literature and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing approaches, this study seeks to contribute to the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany and explore the relationship between post-war culture and the emerging Cold War."
