        "Title: The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, CCLAD, investigates the emergence and contestation of justice norms in the context of climate change loss and damage within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As the world grapples with the urgent need to address the consequences of climate change, the lack of consensus on loss and damage policy hinders effective international cooperation. This interdisciplinary study employs a theoretical and ethnographic methodology to examine the micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative domestic policy practices at the international and national levels.\n\nThe project aims to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, influence, contestation, or reversal, and to develop a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. By exploring how norms are partly constituted through policy-making and implementation, CCLAD seeks to make methodological contributions to political ethnography and practice-tracing methods. The research will focus on policy areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this study will provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage, ultimately informing more effective international cooperation and policy-making in this critical area."
