        "Title: Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships of Transgender People\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on the psychosocial functioning and social relationship experiences of transgender individuals. Despite the growing demand for gender-affirming healthcare, there is a pressing need to better understand the complex interplay between hormone therapy, psychosocial well-being, and social relationships in this population. Transgender people are disproportionately affected by high rates of social disruption and suicide risk, highlighting the urgency for evidence-based interventions.\n\nOur research will employ a biopsychosocial model and cutting-edge research methods to isolate causal pathways linking hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes. The proposed study will consist of four work packages, aimed at empowering transgender individuals to share their personal and relational experiences, and guiding policy and practice for gender identity services. By positioning itself at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare, this project seeks to improve psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes for transgender people. The study will adhere to an informed consent model, prioritizing the autonomy and well-being of participants. Ultimately, the findings from this research will contribute to the development of more effective and compassionate healthcare services for transgender individuals."
