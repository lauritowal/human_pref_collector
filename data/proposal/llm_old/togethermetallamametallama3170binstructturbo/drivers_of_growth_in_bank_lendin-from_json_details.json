        "Title: Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to investigate the complex relationships between bank lending, financial crises, and the underlying factors driving these phenomena. Despite a consensus on the need for tighter financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension, decisive empirical evidence on the individual drivers of credit growth is lacking. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by empirically identifying the impact of key ingredients, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending booms, real estate price booms, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios, on loan growth.\n\nUtilizing exceptional micro-level datasets and an appropriate methodology, this project will estimate the impact of each factor on credit growth, assess potential combinations of ingredients, and ensure external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies. Theoretical frameworks will be developed where necessary to support the analysis. By providing a deeper understanding of the drivers of credit growth, this project will contribute to the development of more effective financial regulations and policies to mitigate the risk of financial crises and their negative externalities on the macro real sector."
