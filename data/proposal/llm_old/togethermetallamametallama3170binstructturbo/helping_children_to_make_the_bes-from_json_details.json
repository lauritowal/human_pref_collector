        "Title: Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe transition to high school is a critical period in a child's development, marked by significant social, emotional, and academic changes. However, many children struggle with this transition due to peer rejection, victimization, low teacher support, and conflictual teacher-student relationships. These challenges can negatively impact their self-regulation and stress-regulation abilities, ultimately affecting their well-being and academic performance.\n\nThis project proposes the development and implementation of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to support children's transition to high school. A.L.I.B.I. is a virtual high school environment where players must uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, promoting prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and consideration of multiple response options with a focus on long-term perspectives.\n\nOur objectives are to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a standalone serious game, assess its effectiveness in improving children's transition experiences, integrate it into ongoing school transition trainings, and develop a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. We will partner with three school counseling organizations and implement the project in three regions in The Netherlands.\n\nBy providing a realistic yet safe learning environment, A.L.I.B.I. offers a unique opportunity for children to rehearse prosocial behaviors and develop essential skills for a successful transition to high school. We believe that A.L.I.B.I. has the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many children and contribute to a smoother and more supportive transition to high school."
