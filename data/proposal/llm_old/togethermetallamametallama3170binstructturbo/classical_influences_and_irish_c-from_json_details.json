        "Title: Classical Influences and Irish Culture\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project explores the underexamined relationship between ancient Greece and Rome and Ireland's unique cultural heritage. Despite not being part of the Roman Empire, Ireland has a long tradition of classical learning, evident in its earliest recorded literature. Our hypothesis is that Ireland's engagement with classical culture has had a profound and lasting impact on its literature, politics, and society.\n\nThis multi-thematic study will employ a heuristic framework to examine nine key themes, including language, land, travel and exile, and female voices, among others. By facilitating dialogue between fields such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, and postcolonial studies, we aim to shed new light on the intersections between classical culture and Irish identity.\n\nOur research coincides with the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state (1912-1922) and the ongoing struggles with violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. By investigating the influence of classical culture on Irish literary, social, and political discourse, we expect to uncover new avenues of investigation and reveal the enduring impact of classical culture on Irish society beyond the past 100 years. This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of Ireland's complex cultural heritage and its continued relevance in contemporary debates."
