        "Title: Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes to establish a comprehensive Quaternary timescale for human expansion and evolution in Europe, spanning the last 2.6 million years. By integrating amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating methods, specifically on calcitic fossils and snail opercula, this study will overcome the limitations of radiocarbon dating (~60,000 years) and provide a robust chronology for the entire Palaeolithic period in Eurasia. Focusing on key regions such as Britain and the Black Sea, our research aims to refine the understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change. Critical questions regarding the timing of early human expansion into Europe, climatic conditions during this period, and differences in tool technologies will be addressed. A pan-European chronology will be developed, shedding light on the complex interactions between human evolution, migration, and environmental factors, including climatic oscillations, ice sheet expansions, and sea-level changes. The proposed project will provide a breakthrough in our ability to understand our past, offering a nuanced and detailed framework for future research in the field of human evolution and migration."
