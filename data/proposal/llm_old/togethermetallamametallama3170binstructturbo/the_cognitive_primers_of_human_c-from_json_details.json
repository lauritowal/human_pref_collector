        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Cognitive Primers of Human Culture: A Comparative Approach to the Emergence of Innovations\n\nThis four-year study aims to investigate the conditions driving innovations across primates, with a focus on the creation and use of sharp stone tools (flakes), a pivotal milestone in human cultural development. By employing a triangulation approach, combining artificial intelligence coding methods, an experimental paradigm, and large sample sizes (N=350), we will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques. We will then test the roles of exposure and experience as drivers of innovations, comparing primate assemblages to the oldest human stone tools to infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates.\n\nUsing Structural Equation Models to analyze our findings, we anticipate that this study will significantly enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations and the primers of human culture. Our research has the potential to shed new light on the evolution of human cognition and the development of cultural capacities, ultimately informing strategies for promoting innovation and creativity in human societies. The proposed study will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive, social, and environmental factors that underlie human cultural emergence."
