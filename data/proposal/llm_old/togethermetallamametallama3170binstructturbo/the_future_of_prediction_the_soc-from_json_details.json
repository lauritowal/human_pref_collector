        "Title: The Future of Prediction: Investigating the Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecasting in Insurance, Medicine, and Policing\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, situated at the intersection of social sciences, insurance, medicine, and policing, proposes to investigate the far-reaching consequences of algorithmic forecasting on social institutions. As we increasingly rely on Big Data, Machine Learning, and digital forecasting, the traditional probabilistic approaches to prediction are being replaced by algorithmic methods. This shift has significant implications for personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing, where the interplay between individualization and mutualization principles, statistical and algorithmic methods, and the problem of bias must be carefully considered.\n\nOur research aims to examine the challenges and opportunities arising from the transition to algorithmic prediction, with a particular focus on the tension between prevention and repression in predictive policing. By analyzing the social consequences of this shift, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between technology, institutions, and society. The project will employ a multi-method approach, combining empirical research, theoretical analysis, and stakeholder engagement to provide a comprehensive understanding of the future of prediction and its implications for social institutions. Our findings will inform policy and practice, ensuring that the benefits of algorithmic forecasting are realized while minimizing its negative consequences."
