        "Title: Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, \"Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination,\" seeks to develop an innovative ecological model for understanding the complex relationships between violence, representation, and the natural world. Through a comparative and transnational analysis, our research team will examine how cultural expressions, including literature, art, and media, represent and respond to environmental violence, colonialism, and genocide. By integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we aim to reorient these fields to consider the more-than-human dimensions of violence and its impact on human and non-human communities.\n\nOur project will produce a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture, mapping the links between ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide, and analyzing the affective and emotional responses these representations elicit. Additionally, we will create a best practices guide for pedagogical engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence, providing educators with the tools to foster critical literacies about ecoviolence and environmental crisis. By providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms, our project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersections between human and non-human worlds and inform strategies for promoting environmental justice and sustainability."
