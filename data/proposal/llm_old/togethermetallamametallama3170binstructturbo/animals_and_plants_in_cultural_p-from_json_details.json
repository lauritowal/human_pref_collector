        "Title: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin: Unpacking the Concept of Zoophytography\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" seeks to investigate the representation of non-human beings in cultural productions about the Amazon River Basin, with a focus on their dynamic role in shaping human cultural life. The proposed study introduces the concept of \"zoophytography,\" which describes the inscription of animals and plants in texts, cinema, and artworks, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making.\n\nThrough three research streams, the project will (1) develop a definition of zoophytography, tracing its roots to Indigenous, riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy; (2) analyze the articulation of animals in cultural productions; and (3) examine the representation of plants in texts, cinema, and artworks. The study will contribute to the fields of environmental humanities, Amazonian ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, revealing the interdependence of humans and non-humans, drawing attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia, and uncovering equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants. By exploring the concept of zoophytography, this project aims to shed new light on the complex relationships between humans and non-humans in the Amazon River Basin, ultimately promoting a more nuanced understanding of the region's rich cultural and environmental heritage."
