        "Title: Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nMillions of households in Eastern and Central Europe face energy vulnerability due to factors such as rising energy prices, harsh climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, and socio-economic restructuring. Current conceptualizations of energy poverty focus primarily on income and energy efficiency, neglecting the complex social and spatial dimensions that exacerbate this issue. This project seeks to investigate energy vulnerability in post-socialist city contexts, adopting an energy vulnerability framework to capture the multifaceted nature of this problem.\n\nThrough a comparative study of four case cities (Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje), we will employ a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty. Our research aims to transform the understanding of energy vulnerability, informing the development of more effective technical and institutional frameworks to provide affordable energy services and mitigate climate change. The project's findings will contribute to evidence-based policy-making, ultimately improving the livelihoods of millions of households affected by energy vulnerability in the region."
