        "Title: NGIPALAJEM: Unraveling the Evolutionary Landscape of Modern Human Origins in Africa\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe NGIPALAJEM project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of modern human evolution within the African context. Focusing on the Turkana region, this research aims to establish empirical benchmarks to address fundamental questions surrounding human origins. The proposed study will investigate the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas during the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), a period characterized by increased climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, which began 1.4 million years ago and lasted for 1 million years.\n\nThrough fieldwork in Turkana, we aim to expand the hominin and large vertebrate fossil records, with a particular focus on the discovery of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. Advanced analytical techniques, including inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses, as well as novel morphometric approaches, will be employed to examine the fossil record of the last million years. By exploring the phenotypic diversity of the Middle Pleistocene, this project will provide new insights into the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens in Africa. The expected outcomes of NGIPALAJEM will contribute significantly to our understanding of human evolution, shedding light on the complex and dynamic relationships between early humans and their African environment."
