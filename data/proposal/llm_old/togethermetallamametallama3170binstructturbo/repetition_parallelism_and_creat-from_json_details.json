        "Title: Repetition, Parallelism, and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition (REPAC)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, REPAC, proposes an in-depth examination of the intricate relationship between textual form and function in Ancient Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions. Focusing on the first millennium BCE, our investigation will delve into the strategic use of repetition, parallelism, and other textual features in literary, magical, and mantic genres inscribed on clay tablets in Cuneiform script and the Akkadian language. By analyzing the employment of exact repetition, variant repetition, refrain, and ring composition, we aim to uncover the underlying worldview of Mesopotamian scribes, particularly their beliefs in interconnection, causal effectiveness, and similarity.\n\nThis research seeks to fill the knowledge gap in understanding the Mesopotamian literary and scholarly method, particularly the role of analogy and worldview in shaping their creative efforts. Our expected outcome is an improved comprehension of Ancient Mesopotamian creative endeavors, shedding light on the aesthetic, rhetorical, and argumentative purposes of their compositions. Ultimately, REPAC will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between textual form, function, and the cultural context in which they were created."
