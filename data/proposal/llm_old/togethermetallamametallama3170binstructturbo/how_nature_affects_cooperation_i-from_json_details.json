        "Title: How Nature Affects Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Systems\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to investigate the interplay between natural environments and human cooperation in the management of common pool resources. By integrating insights from economics and sustainability science, we aim to identify the circumstances under which natural preconditions and social settings promote the sustainable use of renewable resources.\n\nOur study will examine three key mechanisms through which nature influences cooperation: (1) tipping points and thresholds in natural systems that can encourage cooperative behavior, (2) the impact of resource abundance volatility on risk preferences and community-based management, and (3) the role of leadership in interacting with the natural environment to foster cooperation and overcome common pool dilemmas.\n\nUtilizing a combination of theoretical and statistical approaches, our research will span three continents, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between natural environments, human behavior, and common pool resource management. By shedding light on the intricate dynamics of human-nature interactions, this project will contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for promoting sustainable resource use and mitigating the risks of environmental degradation."
