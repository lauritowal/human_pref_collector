        "Title: Shared Responsibility in International Law (SHARES)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe SHARES project proposes to rethink the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions, addressing a pressing challenge in the field of international law. The increasing complexity of global issues has led to the proliferation of collective actions and shared responsibilities, complicating the determination of individual actor responsibility and undermining key objectives. Through a comprehensive approach, SHARES aims to uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities, develop new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility, and provide remedies for injured parties.\n\nFocusing on the principles of collective, joint, and proportionate responsibility, as well as processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies, this project will employ a conceptual and theoretical foundation, supplemented by empirical case-studies. By providing innovative solutions to the problem of responsibility dilution, SHARES seeks to ensure the protection of the international rule of law and promote more effective cooperation among international actors. The project's outcomes will have significant implications for the development of international law and policy, ultimately contributing to a more just and accountable global governance framework."
