        "Title: Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the early representational preconditions and the functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. By challenging traditional theories, which consider representing others' beliefs as effortful and late developing, and primarily serving to explain behavior, we introduce a novel theoretical approach. Our perspective posits that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic, effortless, and grounded in online cooperative social interactions.\n\nRecent evidence and our own research findings demonstrate that infants as young as 7 months can automatically compute others' beliefs, even when not required. This project aims to explore the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, chart their developmental unfolding, and investigate the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions.\n\nThrough a comprehensive research program, we will investigate the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, focusing on automatic processes involved in social interactions. By advancing our understanding of these mechanisms, we anticipate a paradigm shift in the field, with significant implications for the study of human collaboration and social learning."
