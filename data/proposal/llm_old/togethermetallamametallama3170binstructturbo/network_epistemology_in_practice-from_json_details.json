        "Title: Network Epistemology in Practice: Unpacking Collective Knowledge Generation at CERN\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes an innovative, interdisciplinary investigation into the mechanisms of collective knowledge generation in large-scale scientific collaborations, focusing on particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). By integrating methods from the history and philosophy of science with digital humanities tools and computational approaches, this study aims to understand how knowledge is produced, validated, and disseminated within complex research networks.\n\nThrough the analysis of born-digital documents, including emails and internal wiki pages, this research will reconstruct internal communication processes and characterize collective research dynamics at CERN. The project's objectives include developing historiographic guidelines for future studies based on born-digital sources, contributing to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, and adapting theoretical models of network epistemology.\n\nBy exploring the intricacies of knowledge production in a cutting-edge scientific environment, this project will provide practical strategies for best practices in history and philosophy of science, as well as innovative methodological approaches for analyzing complex research processes. Ultimately, this research will advance our understanding of how collective knowledge is generated and validated, shedding new light on the dynamics of scientific collaboration and the nature of knowledge itself."
