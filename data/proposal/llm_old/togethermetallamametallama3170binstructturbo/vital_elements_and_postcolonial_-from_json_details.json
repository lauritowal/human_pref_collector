        "Title: Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between vital elements, human life, and the environment in the Mediterranean context, focusing on the harbour town of Zarzis, Tunisia. By employing a novel approach that utilizes forensics as the art of paying attention, we aim to elucidate the complex dynamics that shape the end of lives in this region. Through a series of case studies on phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment, we will map the unliveable life conditions that emerge from the interplay between these vital elements.\n\nThis project introduces a decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa, develops forensics as a method for ethnographic study, and advances the concept of vital elements. Collaborations with local artists through the Vital Elements Atelier and method lab work will further enrich our research. The project's innovative approach will provide a nuanced understanding of the intricate web of relationships between vital elements and their impact on human life in the Mediterranean region. By shedding light on the often-overlooked relationships between these elements, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping life in Zarzis and beyond."
