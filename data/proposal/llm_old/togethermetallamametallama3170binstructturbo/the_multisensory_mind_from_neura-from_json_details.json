        "Title: The Multisensory Mind: From Neural Mechanisms to Cognition\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"The Multisensory Mind: From Neural Mechanisms to Cognition,\" seeks to advance our understanding of multisensory integration (MI), the process by which our brains combine sensory inputs to form coherent perceptions. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, our research program will employ human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine neural and neurochemical markers of MI. Our objectives are twofold: (1) to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying MI and (2) to test a novel hypothesis regarding the role of synchronized neural populations in multisensory perception.\n\nOur study will comprise two participant groups: healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, a condition characterized by impaired multisensory integration. By comparing these groups, we aim to shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying MI and its dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. The outcomes of this research program will have significant implications for the development of novel treatments for conditions with impaired multisensory integration, ultimately improving the lives of individuals affected by these conditions."
