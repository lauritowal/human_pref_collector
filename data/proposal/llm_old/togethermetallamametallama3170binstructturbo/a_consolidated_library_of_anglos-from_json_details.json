        "Title: A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe propose the creation of a comprehensive online and interactive library of Anglo-Saxon poetry, spanning the period from approximately 670 to 1100 CE. This digital repository will consolidate and standardize all surviving Old English and Anglo-Latin verse, utilizing TEI P5 XML markup. The corpus will comprise approximately 60,000 lines of poetry, evenly divided between the two languages, and will draw from manuscript witnesses.\n\nA key focus of the project is to document the influence of named poets, of which there are approximately 50, while also tracing potential influences in anonymous verse. The digital library will be enriched with sound-files and image-files, providing a rich sensory experience for users.\n\nThe project will culminate in a series of publications showcasing the comprehensive multilingual corpus, and will be accompanied by conferences and workshops that bring together scholars from across Europe. By examining the coexistence of Latin and the vernacular in a Christian context, our research will have significant geographical and historical scope, shedding new light on the literary and cultural heritage of the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support the development of this innovative digital resource, which will revolutionize the study of Anglo-Saxon poetry and provide a valuable tool for scholars, researchers, and the broader public."
