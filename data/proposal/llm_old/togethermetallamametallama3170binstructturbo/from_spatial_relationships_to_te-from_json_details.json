        "Title: From Spatial Relationships to Temporal Correlations: New Vistas on Predictive Coding\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of gamma waves in predictive coding within the visual cortex, with a focus on their encoding functions, cortical communication, and synaptic plasticity. Gamma waves, oscillating at frequencies between 30-80 Hz, are hypothesized to play a crucial role in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. Our research aims to challenge the standard view that gamma waves carry prediction errors, instead proposing a new hypothesis that gamma waves signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, facilitating long-range gamma synchronization to predict each other's visual input.\n\nUsing a combination of deep-learning networks, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), we will develop a novel method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision. Our study will involve both marmosets and humans, examining the dependence of gamma waves on experience and perceptual learning. We will also employ optogenetics to test the driving role of gamma waves in perceptual learning.\n\nWe anticipate that our research will provide evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying predictive coding. This knowledge has significant implications for understanding the neural basis of neurological and psychiatric disorders, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
