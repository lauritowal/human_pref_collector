        "Title: Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal, \"Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects,\" aims to investigate the role of effort in the reproduction of social inequality, with a focus on intergenerational mobility and equality of opportunity. We will develop and utilize cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry, to examine the relationship between children's effort levels and their parental socioeconomic background.\n\nThe study will be conducted in Spain and Germany, involving school-age children and their parents. We will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining experimental data collection, analysis of subjective effort dispositions from (inter)national surveys, and triangulation of methodologies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nThis project has the potential to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity. The findings will offer valuable insights for educational practitioners and contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design. By advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social inequality, this project will contribute to the development of more effective policies aimed at promoting equality of opportunity."
