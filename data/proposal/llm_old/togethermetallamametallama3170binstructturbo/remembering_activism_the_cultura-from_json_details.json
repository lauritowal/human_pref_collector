        "Title: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe (ReAct)\n\nAbstract:\n\nReAct is a groundbreaking research project that seeks to provide the first comprehensive account of how activism in Europe has been remembered and forgotten since the late 19th century. Through a multi-disciplinary approach, this project will investigate the complex dynamics of cultural memory, tracing the evolution of protest depiction across different media regimes. Focusing on three pivotal periods in European history (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012), ReAct will adopt a novel framework consisting of three lines of inquiry: mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. By employing innovative methods, including network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references, this project aims to reveal the continuities and changes in protest depiction, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying memory of protest, and show how this memory feeds back into later movements. The expected outcomes of ReAct will have far-reaching implications, contributing to a major reorientation in cultural memory research, developing critical literacies for rethinking collective memory and identity, and opening up new areas of social movement research."
