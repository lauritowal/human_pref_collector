        "Title: Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research proposal seeks to investigate the mechanisms underlying long-term memory formation and maintenance in humans, while exploring the potential for developing artificial systems that mimic these processes. The \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\" project aims to validate a set of 10 provocative claims that challenge current understanding of human memory and its neural basis. Leveraging a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development, the project will employ a range of experimental paradigms, including fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients.\n\nComputer simulations of networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will be used to model the dynamics of memory formation and maintenance, while bio-inspired hardware development will focus on creating memristor-like devices that mimic brain memory systems. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the complex processes underlying human long-term memory and to inform the development of novel artificial intelligence architectures that can learn and remember in a more human-like manner. The findings of this research have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of memory and cognition, with significant implications for fields ranging from neuroscience to artificial intelligence."
