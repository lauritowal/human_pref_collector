        "Title: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms that play a critical role in modulating brain function and behaviour. Despite sharing 99% genetic identicality, human individuals exhibit distinct gut microbiota profiles, varying between 40-90% in composition. This proposal aims to bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters, particularly GABA, on brain function and behaviour. By adopting a biochemically informed approach, focusing on GABA, our interdisciplinary research team will investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. We will also test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour through a custom-made probiotic intervention over four weeks. This research will advance our understanding of the intricate relationships between the gut microbiome, brain GABA levels, and behaviour, ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying individual differences in human behaviour and brain function, this project will push the frontiers of psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology research."
