        "Title: Wage Inequality within and across Firms: The Role of Market Forces, Government and Firm Policies\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research proposal seeks to investigate the complex factors driving wage inequality within and across firms, with a particular focus on industrialized countries over the past four decades. Using comprehensive data from German social security records, survey data, and administrative data, our study aims to shed light on the growing disparities in wages between and within firms, as well as persistent gender gaps, particularly in the context of childbirth and family responsibilities.\n\nThe project consists of three interconnected components. Project A examines the impact of market forces, such as product market competition and technological change, on wage inequality. Project B investigates the effects of government policies, including minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes, on selection, reallocation, and differential growth. Project C focuses on firm policies, including family-friendly policies and flexible working arrangements, and their influence on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth.\n\nBy analyzing the interplay between market forces, government policies, and firm policies, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms driving wage inequality and identify effective strategies for promoting greater equality and inclusion in the labor market."
