        "Title: Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity,\" seeks to provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence of play and games in ancient Greek and Roman societies. Spanning over 1,300 years, from c. 800 BCE to c. 500 CE, the project will explore the roles of play and games in the lives of diverse participants, including free men, slaves, men, women, adults, children, and even gods.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, combining linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological methods, the project will examine the various environments in which play and games took place, including urban and rural settings. It will draw on a range of source types, including written, archaeological, and iconographic materials.\n\nThe project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural significance of play and games in classical antiquity, shedding light on the social dynamics, power structures, and cultural values of ancient societies. Furthermore, the project will engage with related fields, such as gender studies and education studies, to provide a nuanced and contextualized analysis of play and games in ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nThe project's outputs will include training models, research models, and educational materials for schools, museums, and libraries, making the results accessible to a broad audience and promoting a greater appreciation for the cultural heritage of classical antiquity."
