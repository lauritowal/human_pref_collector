        "Title: The Swedish Historical Database Project\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a comprehensive historical database covering approximately 2500 Swedish administrative districts from 1749 to 1952. The proposed database will provide highly disaggregated data on a yearly basis, encompassing a wide range of variables including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social statistics, agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments.\n\nA key feature of this project is its comprehensive local-level data, offering a unique perspective on Sweden's historical development. The database will also provide an international perspective, allowing researchers to compare Sweden's growth and development patterns with those of other countries.\n\nThe data series will be anchored in Sweden's continuous reliable population data, starting from 1749. This dataset has significant research potential, particularly in the areas of economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development. Empirical identification strategies, including instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation, will be employed to analyze the data.\n\nBy making this dataset publicly available, this project aims to facilitate cutting-edge research in economic development and growth. The proposed database will be a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and scholars, providing new insights into Sweden's historical development and its implications for contemporary economic policy."
