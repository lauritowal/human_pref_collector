        "Title: Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multidisciplinary research project seeks to unravel the mysteries of the peopling of Australasia by c.50,000 years ago, a pivotal event in human history marked by the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the earliest 'open water' crossing. Focusing on the Sunda (South East Asia) and Sahul (Australasia) regions, our project brings together archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics to address the fundamental questions of when, where, who, and how early seafarers colonized Australasia.\n\nThrough a combination of offshore and onshore research, we aim to examine the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf, identify potential submerged prehistoric sites, and enhance our understanding of palaeoshoreline and tidal regimes. Archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data will provide critical insights into demography and dating.\n\nOur project expects to yield significant outcomes, including refined knowledge of the onshore and offshore environment, a deeper understanding of human origins, insights into population dynamics and migration, and knowledge of seafaring technology and social organisation. By tackling these questions, we will shed new light on one of the most significant events in human history, providing a more nuanced understanding of the technological, cognitive, and social aspects of early seafaring and the colonization of Sahul."
