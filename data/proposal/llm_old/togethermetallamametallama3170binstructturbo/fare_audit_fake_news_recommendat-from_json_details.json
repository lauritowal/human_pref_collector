        "Title: FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proliferation of disinformation on the internet poses a significant threat to democracy and civic discourse. Search engines play a crucial role in the dissemination of false information, often perpetuating information bubbles that reinforce existing biases. The FARE_AUDIT project aims to address this issue by developing an innovative auditing system that investigates how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation.\n\nThis project has three primary objectives: (1) to understand the relationship between browsing history and disinformation spread, (2) to create a system for democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time, and (3) to breach information bubbles by simulating different user online profiles. Our proposed auditing tool will utilize privacy-protecting web-crawlers that do not require real user data.\n\nWe anticipate that FARE_AUDIT will increase public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread and equip organizations with a disinformation detection and monitoring tool. By developing this system, we aim to promote a more informed and critically engaged citizenry, ultimately contributing to a healthier democratic ecosystem."
