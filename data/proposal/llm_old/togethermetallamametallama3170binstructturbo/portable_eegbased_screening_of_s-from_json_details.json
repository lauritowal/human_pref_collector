        "Title: Portable EEG-based Screening of Social Predispositions in Newborns: A Novel Approach for Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\n\nAbstract:\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects millions of children worldwide, but early detection and intervention remain significant challenges. This grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking project to develop a portable, wireless EEG-based device for newborns, enabling rapid and automatic testing of face processing in any context. Our innovative device will utilize dry electrodes and an oscillatory visual presentation to capture an EEG-based index of face processing, requiring less than 2 minutes of newborn visual attention. An automatic on-line extraction algorithm will facilitate efficient data analysis and biomarker identification.\n\nThe proposed device addresses a significant market gap, as no fully portable EEG system for newborns is currently available. Our technology has the potential to revolutionize ASD diagnosis and intervention by enabling large-scale screening protocols and facilitating early behavioral intervention for at-risk newborns. The device's versatility will also enable research on neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions, with use cases extending to home testing and research settings.\n\nThis project has the potential to significantly impact the lives of families and individuals affected by ASD, and we believe that our novel approach can lead to a breakthrough in early detection and intervention. We look forward to the opportunity to develop and implement this innovative technology."
