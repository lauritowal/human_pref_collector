        "Title: From Warfare to Welfare: A Comparative Study of Combat Trauma Internalization and Institutionalization\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project undertakes a comparative anthropological study of combat trauma in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. By examining the intersections of biopolitics, medicalization, and institutional practices in military and psychiatric settings, we aim to develop a nuanced framework for understanding the complex processes shaping veteran care. Through ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, this project seeks to shed light on the internalization of combat trauma and its institutionalization in different national contexts.\n\nOur research focuses on the experiences of veterans and clinicians in navigating the institutional landscape of military and psychiatric institutions, with particular attention to the role of ethnicity in shaping these experiences. By analyzing conflicting values and perceptions, we aim to identify key problems in veteran care and inform policy and healthcare reform.\n\nThis project has the potential to significantly advance studies in biopolitics and medicalization, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of war-related suffering and its internalization. Ultimately, our research seeks to improve the lives of veterans and clinicians, and to promote more effective and compassionate care for those affected by combat trauma."
