        "Title: De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of early European political economy by examining the practical concerns and policies of improvement that shaped the eighteenth-century Swedish Empire. Rather than interpreting historical debates through modern lenses, this research focuses on the nuanced measures and policies implemented to enhance state organization, societal welfare, and economic growth. By analyzing discursive production sites, including the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, we aim to illustrate how various stakeholders collaborated to improve the living conditions of the population.\n\nOur hypothesis posits that activities within each of these sites were geared towards enhancing state and societal organization, as well as promoting the welfare of citizens. Through a comparative analysis of the Swedish Empire and other relevant cases, we will develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities and variations in eighteenth-century political economy. By de-centering traditional narratives and embracing a more nuanced, contextual approach, this project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the historical development of economic thought and its ongoing implications for contemporary policy-making."
