        "Title: Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy: An Exploration of the Global Pharmaceutical Drug Market in Asia and Africa\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to investigate the complexities of the global pharmaceutical drug market, with a focus on Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACTs) in Africa and Asia. By conducting a comparative study in Benin, Ghana, and Cambodia, this project aims to shed light on the supply and demand dynamics, globalizing processes, and public health consequences of the global drug market.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to analyze the realities affecting the global drug market, study the impact of globalizing processes on pharmaceutical systems in Benin and Ghana, and investigate the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. Through a mixed-methods approach combining anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, this project will examine formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, drug use, and local production and regulations.\n\nThe project's goals are to foster reflection on more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project will also provide training opportunities for Master's and PhD students, as well as postdoctoral researchers. With the support of the principal investigator's expertise and solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, this project is well-positioned to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the global pharmaceutical drug market and its implications for public health."
