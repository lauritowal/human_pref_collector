        "Title: Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults and Families\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research study to investigate the effects of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) on children, adults, and families. Over the last four decades, more than five million children have been born through MAR treatments, with an increasing trend in their use. However, existing research on the topic has yielded mixed findings due to low statistical power and conceptual limitations.\n\nOur proposed study will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining comprehensive analysis, comparison across different life domains, and innovative research designs to establish causality. Utilizing population registers and surveys, we will analyze outcomes such as physical and mental health, education, and union stability in MAR-conceived individuals. Our research designs include sibling comparison (MAR-conceived vs. spontaneously conceived) and adult comparison (successful MAR conception vs. unsuccessful).\n\nThis study aims to produce ground-breaking results that will inform future research, have important policy implications, and benefit various stakeholders, including health professionals, public health authorities, and policymakers. Our findings will contribute to evidence-based health advising, resource allocation, and MAR treatment subsidies, ultimately enhancing the well-being of individuals and families involved in MAR."
