        "Title: Managing Performative Science (MAPS): A Novel Approach to Understanding the Implications of Performativity in Scientific Disciplines\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Managing Performative Science (MAPS) project seeks to address the pressing need for a deeper understanding of performativity in science, particularly in the fields of economics, epidemiology, and machine learning. Performativity refers to the phenomenon where scientific predictions and explanations shape the very reality they seek to describe. MAPS aims to develop a novel understanding of performativity, assess the associated ethical risks, and provide a framework for the assessment and management of performative science.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach combining philosophy of science, ethics, and domain-specific expertise, MAPS will investigate the implications of performativity in scientific research and its applications. The project will focus on three key areas: (1) elucidating the mechanisms of performativity in economics, epidemiology, and machine learning; (2) assessing the ethical risks and challenges associated with performativity; and (3) developing a comprehensive framework for managing performative science.\n\nBy closing the current lacuna in philosophical guidance on performative science, MAPS will provide researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders with a much-needed tool for navigating the complexities of performativity. Ultimately, the project aims to promote responsible scientific practice, mitigate the risks of performativity, and foster a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between science, ethics, and society."
