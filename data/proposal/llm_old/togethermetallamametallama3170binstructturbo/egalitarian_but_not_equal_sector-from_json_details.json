        "Title: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials (WAGE Project)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe WAGE Project aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining and its impact on sectoral wage formation. Despite advances in egalitarian policies, the global average gender pay gap (GPG) remains at 20%, with Europe's average standing at 13% (United Nations, 2022; Eurostat, 2022). This project seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms that perpetuate these disparities, focusing on Germany, Norway, and Sweden as case studies. Through ethnographic research, the WAGE Project will explore the metal sector (male-dominated) and the nursing sector (female-dominated) to identify the daily practices and power dynamics that influence wage bargaining outcomes.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: (1) to synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the selected countries; (2) to analyze collective bargaining rounds in the metal and nursing sectors, revealing the practices that result in wage increases; and (3) to document how actors in these sectors relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. By shedding light on the complex, often hidden, processes driving gendered wage differentials, the WAGE Project will contribute valuable insights to inform policy interventions and promote more equitable wage formation practices."
