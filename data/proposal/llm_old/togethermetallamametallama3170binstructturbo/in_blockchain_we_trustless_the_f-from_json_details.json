        "Title: In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe BlockchainGov project proposes a multidisciplinary investigation into the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, bridging the fields of computer science, political science, and law. This research will analyze the power dynamics, legitimacy, and sustainability of existing blockchain systems, as well as their potential to support decentralized decision-making models. The project's objectives are four-fold: (1) investigate the governance of current blockchain systems, (2) analyze power dynamics within these systems, (3) examine the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance, and (4) experiment with new models at community and global governance levels.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the establishment of a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, empirical and theoretical contributions to the scientific community, and policy implications for global governance. To achieve these ambitious goals, the project requires a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team, and a diverse set of multidisciplinary skills. By exploring the potential of blockchain technology to reshape governance structures, BlockchainGov aims to contribute to a more equitable, sustainable, and decentralized future."
