        "Title: Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Resilient Cultures,\" explores the ways in which popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema in mainland China and Hong Kong express social and political discontent, foster resilience, and critique authoritarianism in the face of platformization. Through a comparative analysis of indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, this project examines the tactics employed by cultural practitioners to maintain creative autonomy and promote cultural critique.\n\nUtilizing an innovative methodological toolkit combining ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research, this project will establish a network of researchers, artists, and cultural institutions in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, Europe, and comparative contexts in Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey. The project will facilitate workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions to promote multivocality, diversity, and the vitality of cultural production.\n\nBy investigating the intersections of cultural production, social change, and authoritarianism, \"Resilient Cultures\" aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between creative expression, cultural critique, and social resilience in the face of repression. The project's expected outcomes will shed light on the ways in which cultural practices can develop resilient tactics to express dissent, challenge dominant narratives, and promote social change."
