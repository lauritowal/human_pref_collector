        "Title: Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive neurocognitive model to elucidate how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Building on recent advances in brain signal analysis, our approach departs from traditional methods by studying social interaction under naturalistic settings, utilizing novel signal analysis methods, and measuring temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals. We will employ experimental techniques and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition to investigate the neural basis of social information representation. Our hypotheses predict that selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with synchronous brain activity, and intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow. By adopting a naturalistic neuroscience approach, this project has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of brain dynamics of social interaction and contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience."
