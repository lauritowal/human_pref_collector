        "**Title:** Inference in Microeconometric Models\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop novel inference methods for microeconometric models that account for unobserved heterogeneity, a fundamental challenge in empirical economics. Our approach leverages longitudinal data to enhance the performance of statistical hypothesis tests and estimation procedures. The project consists of three interconnected blocks, each focusing on a distinct aspect of inference in microeconometric models.\n\nBlock 1 will concentrate on improving inference in nonlinear models, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. Block 2 will introduce a novel approach to estimating models for network data by treating it as panel data, providing formal results in this area. Block 3 will develop non-parametric estimation methods for dynamic discrete-choice models, incorporating unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables.\n\nThe proposed methods will have far-reaching applications in various fields, including labor economics (e.g., labor force participation) and international trade (e.g., import and export behavior of firms and countries). Theoretical and simulation-based assessments will be employed to evaluate the proposed methods. Ultimately, this project aims to provide more accurate insights into the underlying mechanisms driving economic outcomes, which are often influenced by unobserved differences between economic agents."
