        "Title: The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach\n\nAbstract:\n\nFriendship is a vital component of human health and well-being, with significant implications for public health and policy. Social isolation, comparable in risk to smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity, is a pressing concern that demands a deeper understanding of the evolutionary origins of friendship. This project aims to investigate the evolutionary origins of friendship through a cross-species comparison and experimental approach.\n\nUsing a comprehensive dataset of nonhuman primates, including macaques, and social experiments, we will achieve three key objectives: (1) test environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species, (2) establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill, and (3) examine whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion.\n\nBy exploring the evolutionary perspective of friendship, this project seeks to provide a critical understanding of what it means to be human. Our findings will contribute significantly to the development of effective interventions and policies aimed at mitigating social isolation and promoting human well-being. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform strategies for fostering healthier, more connected communities."
