        "Title: The Real Estate/Financial Complex: Unpacking the Intersections of Property, Capital, and State Power\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project seeks to bridge a critical knowledge gap by exploring the intricate relationships between real estate, finance, and state involvement. Building on the premise that these connections have been under-explored, we propose the concept of the \"Real Estate/Financial Complex\" as a framework for understanding the complex interplay between property markets, financial systems, and state power. Our research aims to investigate the quantitative and qualitative shifts in the real estate/financial complex since 2007, with a focus on the role of the state in shaping these dynamics.\n\nThe project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining internationally comparative research, national mappings, and local/urban case studies across multiple countries. A postdoctoral researcher will lead the comparative research, while three PhD students will conduct in-depth studies in six countries. The principal investigator will focus on the qualitative shift towards real estate finance and the state, as well as the global dimensions and conceptualization of the real estate/financial complex.\n\nBy examining the intersections of real estate, finance, and state power, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex systems that shape our built environment, economies, and societies. Our research will have significant implications for policymakers, scholars, and practitioners seeking to navigate the intricacies of the real estate/financial complex and its far-reaching consequences."
