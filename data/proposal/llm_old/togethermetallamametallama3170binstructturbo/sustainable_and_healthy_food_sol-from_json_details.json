        "Title: Sustainable and Healthy Food Solutions: System Dynamics and Trade-Offs (FLORA Project)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe FLORA project aims to contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption by creating essential evidence-based solutions that balance health, environmental, and sustainability goals. This innovative project employs a systemic approach, integrating system dynamics and complex network analyses to diagnose the integrated health and environmental outcomes of global food systems. Key threats and opportunities will be identified, and tailored solutions will be targeted and evaluated using an interdisciplinary modelling framework. By considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics, the FLORA project seeks to enable the identification of the most effective, targeted solutions to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems globally. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of experts to address the complex challenges facing the global agri-food system, with a focus on sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption."
