        "Title: Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, Sacralizing Security, proposes an ethnographic comparison of the intersection of religion, violence, and authority in mega-cities of the Global South. Focusing on Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, we will investigate the emergence of religious vigilantes as non-state security actors in contexts where state agencies lack capacity to provide infrastructure and security. Through in-depth case studies, we will examine how mega-city residents grant authority to these groups and the role of religion in legitimizing their violent practices.\n\nOur research aims to analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes in these cities, draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, and highlight the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. By extending the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of power structures in mega-cities and inform policies aimed at improving human security. The expected outcomes will provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of authority, security, and religion in the Global South."
