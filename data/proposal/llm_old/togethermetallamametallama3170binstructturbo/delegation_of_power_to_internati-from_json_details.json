        "Title: Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed research project examines the dynamics of power delegation to International Organizations (IOs) over time, focusing on the evolution of institutional empowerment. With the increasing number and varied authority of IOs, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence their growth and development. This comparative, longitudinal study draws on insights from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology to investigate the delegation of power to IOs from 1986 to 2010.\n\nThe project analyzes four prominent IOs - the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO - and explores the roles of temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design in shaping their empowerment. Through qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials, this research aims to develop a model of power delegation that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach.\n\nThe project's objective is to provide insights into the consequences of power delegation and contribute to the advancement of theoretical and empirical research in International Relations. By exploring the complexities of institutional empowerment, this study seeks to shed light on the implications of delegation for global governance and international cooperation."
