        "Title: AssemblingLife - Redefining the Paradigm of Life through Self-Assembly Processes\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal, \"AssemblingLife: Shifting our View of Life,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by introducing a novel theoretical framework within the philosophy of science, rooted in self-assembly processes. By integrating insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science, our project challenges the conventional view of life as a complex system dependent on constant energy input and genetic regulation.\n\nOur primary objectives are to develop a new understanding of genetic causation, where genes act as 'nudgers' rather than rigid controllers, and to establish a new theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes. By achieving these aims, we anticipate a paradigm shift in the scientific and philosophical understanding of life, with far-reaching implications for our comprehension of biological systems.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are substantial, offering conceptual tools to both empirical life sciences and the philosophy of science. Our research has the potential to fundamentally alter the way we perceive and study life, opening up new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. We believe that AssemblingLife will contribute significantly to the advancement of our understanding of life and its underlying mechanisms, ultimately transforming the landscape of scientific inquiry."
