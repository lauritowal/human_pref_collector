        "Title: Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project proposes to investigate the lasting impact of authoritarian regimes on the development of norms in new democracies. Focusing on Eastern Europe, particularly Poland and Portugal, this study will examine how ideological associations with past dictatorships shape political positions among voters and parties. Through survey experiments, we will explore voters' avoidance of association with authoritarian ideologies, the impact on party competition, and the effects on citizens' ideological preferences and perceptions of party stances. Our research aims to contribute to a new theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies, shedding light on phenomena such as the decline of left-wing parties in Poland and the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal. By investigating the interplay between national identity, political discussions, and party elite discourse, this project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of post-transition party politics and inform strategies for promoting democratic consolidation in post-authoritarian societies."
