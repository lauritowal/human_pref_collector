        "Title: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe loss of agrobiodiversity poses a significant threat to global food security. Our proposal, Blockchain4Biodiversity, introduces ReSeed, a blockchain-based digital farmers' market designed to incentivize the conservation and sustainable use of farmers' indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK). By leveraging blockchain technology, ReSeed will track the flow of ISK, ensuring decentralized, transparent, and immutable transactions.\n\nThis project addresses the dwindling economic incentives for ISK cultivation and conservation, as well as the lack of intellectual property protection for ISK. Our mixed-methods approach will engage suppliers and buyers of ISK, integrating ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks with minimal required legal amendments. An ethics-guided governance model will ensure the platform's responsible operation.\n\nOver 12 years of previous research have informed this proposal. ReSeed's benefits will include in situ conservation, research and innovation with agrobiodiversity, value addition to farmers' ISK, and economic and environmental benefits to small farmers' communities. By promoting the equitable and traceable transfer of ISK, ReSeed will acknowledge and reward the contributions of small farmers, ultimately contributing to global food security and sustainable agriculture."
