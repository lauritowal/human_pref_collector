        "Title: The Silence of States in International Law\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed research project, \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" aims to investigate the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of State silence in the context of international law. The study seeks to provide the first comprehensive analysis of whether State silence can bind them, the role of State inaction in their responsibility, and the effect of inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings.\n\nBy employing a mixed-methods approach combining analysis of State practice in six official UN languages, international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical analysis of reasoning from government officials and international judges, this project will develop a taxonomy of State silences and critically examine their legal effects. The research will also assess whether a change in the law is necessary to address the implications of State silence.\n\nThe proposed study has significant implications for various stakeholders, including States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals. By shedding light on the complexities of State silence, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of international law and inform policy and decision-making at the national and international levels."
