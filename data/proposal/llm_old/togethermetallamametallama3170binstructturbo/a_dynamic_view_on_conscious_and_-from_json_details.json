        "Title: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes,\" aims to shed new light on the fundamental distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. By employing a multi-faceted approach combining behavioral and brain imaging methods, this project will investigate three key tracks: unconscious perception, conscious perception, and the maturation of consciousness.\n\nThe first track will utilize gaze-contingent substitution techniques to present subliminal videos and stimuli sequences, providing evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences. The second track will employ a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents, specifying the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions. The third track will investigate the development of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, yielding new insights into the maturation of posterior or anterior brain regions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project will significantly advance our understanding of the human mind, providing novel insights into the complex interplay between conscious and unconscious processes. The findings will have far-reaching implications for fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness."
