        "Title: Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe during MIS3\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multidisciplinary project, 'Subsistence and human resilience to sudden climatic events in Europe during MIS3,' seeks to investigate the impact of climatic fluctuations on human subsistence strategies during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Southern European peninsulas. Focusing on the period preceding the extinction of Neanderthals and the colonization of the region by Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH), this project will integrate zooarchaeological analysis, taphonomic analysis, and stable isotope analysis to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions at 20 key archaeological sites.\n\nThe primary objectives of this research are to assess the behavioural flexibility and resilience of both Neanderthals and AMH in response to sudden climatic events, develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity, and identify subsistence patterns favoring AMH colonization. The expected outcomes of this project include a comprehensive understanding of subsistence strategies employed by both species in the face of climatic oscillations and a nuanced understanding of the impact of these oscillations on Neanderthal extinction. This pan-European study has significant implications for our understanding of prehistoric human societies and their responses to environmental challenges."
