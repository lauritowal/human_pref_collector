        "Title: MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE (MEGAMAPS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis transnational research project, MEGAMAPS, proposes a multidisciplinary study of Artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, focusing on the post-2011 period in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. By combining History, Social Movements Theory, Gender studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities methodologies, we aim to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region, challenge traditional approaches, and create a participative digital platform for research and exchange.\n\nOur objectives include investigating the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change, framing and mapping emerging Artivism for gender equality, and documenting a corpus of living sources, including visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and graphic tools. The project's open-access digital platform will be FAIRly accessible to various audiences, including academics, stakeholders, and the general public.\n\nThrough fieldwork, digital ethnography, and dissemination activities, we aim to promote mutual exchanges of best practices, contribute to reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities, and propose an agency paradigm to overcome orientalism and islamophobia. MEGAMAPS seeks to provide the first research platform for Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the complex relationships between Artivism, social movements, and gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space."
