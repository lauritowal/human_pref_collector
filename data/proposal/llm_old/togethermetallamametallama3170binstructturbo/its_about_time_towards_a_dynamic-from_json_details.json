        "Title: It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision,\" seeks to revolutionize the study of human vision by moving away from traditional laboratory-based experiments and embracing a more naturalistic approach. Leveraging an interdisciplinary framework, non-invasive human brain imaging, and cutting-edge multivariate analysis techniques, we aim to investigate vision as a dynamic, active, and semantically-driven process. By analyzing visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes across multiple timeframes, we will establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain.\n\nOur project has three primary objectives: (1) to understand vision as a process geared towards semantic understanding, (2) to explore active information sampling in vision, and (3) to integrate information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. We anticipate that our research will lead to a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision, providing new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions and bridging the gap between biological and synthetic vision. Ultimately, our project will significantly advance our knowledge of human vision and have far-reaching implications for fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and computer vision."
