        "Title: The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support a multidisciplinary research project reevaluating the role of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe during the Middle Ages (1100-1450). Historically, French was one of the non-local languages, alongside Latin, used across multilingual Europe, influencing linguistic identity and shaping a shared European culture. Our research aims to address two primary questions: the relationship between language and identity in Europe and the demarcation of cognate languages from each other.\n\nThrough an interdisciplinary approach combining codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, our team will conduct empirical research on the textual tradition of \"L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César\" and engage in speculative reflection on linguistic identity. Collaboration between scholars from diverse European countries and North America will facilitate the exchange of ideas and foster a deeper understanding of French language's influence on European identity.\n\nThe project's final aim is to interrogate the role of French in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages, providing new insights into the complex dynamics of language, culture, and identity in a multilingual Europe. By exploring the historical significance of French language and literature, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the European cultural heritage and its ongoing relevance in the modern world."
