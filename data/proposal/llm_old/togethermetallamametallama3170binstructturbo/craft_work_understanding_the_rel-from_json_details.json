        "Title: CRAFTWORK: Understanding the Relationship between Identity and Work in the Future of Work\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis multi-methodological, pan-European study, CRAFTWORK, seeks to investigate the dynamic relationship between identity and work in the context of the rapidly evolving future of work landscape. Focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors in the European Union, this research aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the intricate connections between identity, work, and social status. By combining digital methods and qualitative research, CRAFTWORK will provide the first comprehensive inquiry into 'neo-craft' work in the EU, shedding light on subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, and the role of social media in shaping these dynamics. This innovative study will address the pressing challenges of the future of work, contributing to critical studies of new forms of work and informing policy and practice that promotes inclusive and sustainable work arrangements. The CRAFTWORK project will offer a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between identity and work, rethinking traditional interpretative categories and advancing our knowledge of the future of work."
