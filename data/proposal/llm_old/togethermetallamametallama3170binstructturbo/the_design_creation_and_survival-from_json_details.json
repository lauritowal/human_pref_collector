        "Title: The Design, Creation and Survival of Democratic Laws (DEMOLAW)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe DEMOLAW project seeks to advance our understanding of the dynamics underlying the design, creation, and long-term survival of democratic legislation. Focusing on the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, this project will apply cutting-edge computational methods to analyze legislative texts and address three fundamental research questions. Firstly, we aim to identify the key conceptual dimensions that capture the design of a law, exploring the analytical dimensions of versatility and precision. Secondly, we will investigate the factors driving variations in the design of democratic legislation. Finally, we will examine the factors contributing to the stability or change in laws over time.\n\nBy integrating a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design, an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival, and methodological advancements for computational analysis of legislative content, DEMOLAW will make significant contributions to the fields of legislative studies, comparative politics, and policy analysis. The project's findings will provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and citizens seeking to understand the complexities of democratic lawmaking and the factors shaping the evolution of laws over time."
