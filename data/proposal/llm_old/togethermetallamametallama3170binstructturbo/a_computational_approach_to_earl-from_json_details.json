        "Title: A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project proposes a novel computational approach to simulate the early language acquisition process in infants. By leveraging machine learning, automatic speech recognition, and infant behavioral and neurological studies, our model aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying language bootstrapping in infants aged 6-12 months. The project will utilize speech databases from three languages (Japanese, French, and Dutch) to investigate the development of phonemes, words, and contextual rules.\n\nThe project consists of four subprojects: (1) coding, focusing on defining fine-grained and coarse-grained features for speech; (2) lexicon, examining word segmentation in raw speech and the characteristics of the infant lexicon; (3) rules, developing a predictive model of coarticulation in auditory space; and (4) integration, iteratively integrating approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules. The model will be tested and evaluated using numerical assessments on adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases, as well as comparative analyses with state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers.\n\nThe project will also employ prediction testing methods, including artificial languages and a longitudinal study, to validate the model's generalizability and effectiveness. Our ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of early language acquisition and to inform the development of more effective language learning strategies for infants and young children."
