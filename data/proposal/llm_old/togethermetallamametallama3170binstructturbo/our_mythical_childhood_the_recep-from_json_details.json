        "Title: Our Mythical Childhood: The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children's and Young Adults' Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative, cross-regional research project examining the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' culture worldwide. By adopting a pioneering approach, our international team of scholars aims to explore how the legacy of Graeco-Roman tradition is reshaped in response to regional and global challenges, providing insights into identity formation, initiation into adulthood, and the influence of popular culture.\n\nBuilding upon the limitations of current research, which primarily focuses on Western culture, our project will apply regional perspectives without pejorative implications, conducting comparative studies across diverse regions, including Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. This comparative approach will enable a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations and will contribute to integration and cultural exchange.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a supra-regional survey of classical references, in-depth analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. Our research has the potential for broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture, offering new perspectives on the shared heritage of Classical Antiquity and its enduring influence on contemporary society."
