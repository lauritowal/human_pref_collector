        "Title: Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\n\nThis research project proposes a comprehensive examination of the social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine, spanning the period from 1880 to 1920. Focusing on the interactions between imperialism, globalization, Ottoman state building, and social differentiation, this study seeks to understand the social strategies employed by Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class divides to cope with individual and collective challenges. By analyzing census data and comparing social practices across the region and beyond, this project aims to contribute to global social and cultural history, develop a theoretical framework, establish methodological standards, and create a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, this research will provide insights into the impact of colonialism under the British Mandate, shedding light on the complexities of social formations in the late Ottoman period. The project's hypothesis posits that the accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations, and this research seeks to test and refine this hypothesis through rigorous historical analysis."
