        "Title: MetCogCon - Unveiling the Metacognition of Concepts: A Multidisciplinary Investigation\n\nAbstract:\n\nConcepts are the building blocks of human cognition, yet our understanding of the metacognitive processes governing their use remains limited. The proposed project, MetCogCon, aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the thoughts and feelings that accompany the use of concepts, such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES. By combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, employing psychological model-building, and conducting experimental investigation, this project seeks to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for metacognition of concepts.\n\nThis research has far-reaching implications for our understanding of cognitive control, addressing long-standing philosophical problems and informing reasoning policies in everyday and scientific contexts. The expected outcomes of MetCogCon include a deeper understanding of how individuals select, rely on, and reject concepts, ultimately shedding light on the reliability of heuristics in concept selection and enhancing our grasp of a fundamental aspect of the human mind. By elucidating the metacognitive processes underlying concept use, this project will provide a crucial foundation for improving decision-making, reasoning, and problem-solving in various domains."
