        "Title: Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training, aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying brain adaptation to acute stress and develop an innovative method for training stress resilience. We hypothesize that acute stress triggers dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale neural networks, leading to changes in stress resilience. Our objectives are to (1) characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during acute stress and recovery, (2) identify neural markers predicting resilience to stress using wearable biosensors and mobile apps, (3) cross-validate these markers in a high-stress sensitivity patient group, and (4) examine the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts.\n\nUsing a multi-modal approach, including network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback, we will target large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition. Our ultimate goal is to develop an fMRI neurofeedback training program that enables adaptive reallocation of neural resources, promoting stress resilience. By providing insights into brain adaptation to acute stress and identifying transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience, this project will contribute significantly to the understanding and prevention of stress-related disorders."
