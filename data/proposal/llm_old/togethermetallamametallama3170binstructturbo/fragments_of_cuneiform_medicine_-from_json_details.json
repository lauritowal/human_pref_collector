        "Title: Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity (BabMed)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project, BabMed, proposes the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. Focusing on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as preserved in the Aramaic language of the Babylonian Talmud, this research challenges prevalent Eurocentric histories by examining the transmission of medical knowledge between Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia. \n\nBy relying on native taxonomies and comparing Babylonian medicine with neighboring systems, including the standard comparison to Greek medicine, BabMed aims to establish a new paradigm for knowledge transfer across languages and scripts. Our hypothesis is that cuneiform survived longer than previously suspected and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud largely derives from Akkadian medicine.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud, as a unique text that mirrors scientific thinking of both the Greco-Roman and Persian worlds, provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the preservation of Babylonian medicine beyond the death of cuneiform script. This study will significantly expand our understanding of ancient medical knowledge and challenge current historical narratives."
