        "Title: Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers' Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe teaching profession in Europe is faced with pressing issues, including low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This systematic comparative project aims to investigate the institutional dimensions that shape teachers' careers and the teaching profession in three European countries: Belgium, France, and England. Through a post-comparative mixed-method approach, combining policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, and multilevel multi-group analyses, this project seeks to explain the nature of teacher policy, understand changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration.\n\nBy leveraging national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility, this project will provide new theoretical knowledge and a reconceptualization of institutional change. The study will focus on two key participant groups: non-entrants and early leavers. The findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between educational systems, teacher careers, and the teaching profession, ultimately informing evidence-based policies to address the challenges facing the teaching profession in Europe."
