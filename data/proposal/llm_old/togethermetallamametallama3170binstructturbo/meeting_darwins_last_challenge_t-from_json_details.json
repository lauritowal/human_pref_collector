        "Title: Meeting Darwin's Last Challenge: Toward a Global Tree of Human Languages and Genes\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe propose a groundbreaking interdisciplinary project to create a comprehensive tree of human languages and genes, aligning with Charles Darwin's prediction of an eventual isomorphy between the two. Current language classification methods are limited in scope and probabilistically unreliable. In response, we will employ a novel approach, building on advances in formal and typological linguistics (Longobardi and Guardiano, 2009), which provides unprecedented standards of testability and replicability.\n\nOur collaborative team of linguists and biologists will jointly select significant populations for language and gene sampling. We will leverage powerful genetic tools developed over the last decade, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome markers, and mitochondrial DNA markers. Biostatistical methods will be used to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.\n\nBy establishing a correspondence between language families and classical genetic markers, we aim to contribute to the rising impact of molecular biology on historical classification of species and populations, as advocated by Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994). Our project promises to shed new light on the complex relationships between human languages, genes, and populations, ultimately meeting Darwin's last challenge."
