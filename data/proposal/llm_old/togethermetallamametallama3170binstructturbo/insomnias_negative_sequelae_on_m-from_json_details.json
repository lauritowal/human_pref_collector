        "Title: Insomnia's Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged\n\nAbstract:\n\nMajor depressive disorder is a significant public health concern among older adults, with prevalence rates ranging from 1-3% and clinically significant symptoms affecting 8-16%. However, detection rates remain low, and treatment effectiveness is moderate. This proposal addresses the critical need for a preventive intervention strategy targeting insomnia, a common risk factor for depression in the elderly, affecting up to 40% of this population. Individuals with insomnia are at a 13% increased risk of developing depression.\n\nThis project aims to identify at-risk individuals, quantify the underlying mechanisms, and enroll them in optimized intervention protocols. We will employ a multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging approach to identify insomnia subtypes and underlying mechanisms. Our interdisciplinary strategy will integrate findings from neuroscience, psychology, and geriatrics to develop internet-supported, home-applicable interventions focusing on sleep improvement and depression prevention.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to provide subtype profiling, mechanism profiling, and intervention optimization to prevent depression in older adults with insomnia. By targeting insomnia as a key risk factor, we aim to reduce the burden of depression in this population and promote healthy aging."
