        "Title: The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis five-year research project, \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict,\" aims to investigate the complex relationships between social media, conflict, and peacebuilding in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa. The project seeks to address the pressing question of whether increased access to social media in conflict-affected areas perpetuates violence or fosters peace. Our research focuses on non-urban areas, particularly in regions with weak state institutions, where affordable access to the internet can have a significant impact on the world's poorest communities.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, we will examine the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, the role of public authorities in using social media to shape conflict dynamics, and the impact of social media on individuals' experiences with violent conflict. We will investigate these dynamics in the context of dangerous speech online, the exit and entry of individuals from/into conflict, and the tactics employed by actors to shape the Internet. By shedding light on the interplay between social media and conflict in Africa, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between technology, violence, and peace, ultimately informing policies and initiatives that promote peacebuilding and reduce conflict."
