        "Title: Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research proposal seeks to investigate the impact of historical factors on conflict and economic development, with a focus on the effects of colonial experience and prehistoric conflicts. The study is divided into two parts: (1) examining the effect of colonial history on conflict and economic development, using administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America from 1492-1599, and (2) analyzing the long-run dynamics of conflict by constructing a dataset of ancient conflicts using archaeological evidence.\n\nBy exploring the historical roots of conflict and development, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex relationships between institutions, human capital, and economic growth. The study will employ a within-country analysis approach to examine the institutional variation in initial times of colonization and its interaction with human capital, shedding light on the role of historical factors in shaping the trajectories of conflict and economic development in Latin America.\n\nThe proposed research has significant implications for policy-making, as it seeks to provide insights into the historical drivers of conflict and development, ultimately informing strategies for promoting sustainable growth and reducing conflict in regions with complex historical legacies."
