        "Title: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive study of the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked in academic research. The project aims to document, survey, and conceptualize these re-creations, which are expected to number in the hundreds. Through a combination of field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and grouping of monuments, the study will provide new insights into the role of these monuments in shaping pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices.\n\nThe research will focus on the icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, space, and place aspects of these re-creations, with a particular emphasis on their ability to transport and recreate the experience of Jerusalem in European contexts. The project will employ collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange among researchers.\n\nThe project's outputs will include various publications throughout its stages, culminating in a comprehensive book at the end of the research. The findings of this study will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex relationships between pilgrimage, sacred spaces, and devotionalism, and will shed new light on the ways in which Jerusalem has been imagined and re-created in European contexts."
