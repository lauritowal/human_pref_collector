        "Title: Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach to understanding household consumption and decision-making processes using non-unitary modeling and revealed preference analysis. The proposed methodology integrates marriage market dynamics into structural modeling, avoiding parametric assumptions on decision processes. By employing a nonparametric, empirical analysis toolkit, this project aims to open the \"intrahousehold black box\" and provide a more nuanced understanding of household consumption patterns.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are to describe the intrahousehold decision process, analyze household consumption, and address the challenges of unobserved heterogeneity across households and limited power of revealed preference restrictions. Using pooled cross-section data sets, this research will develop a nonparametric estimation of demand systems that incorporates revealed preference restrictions.\n\nThe proposed project has significant theoretical and empirical contributions, including the integration of marriage market dynamics into structural modeling and the development of a new toolkit for empirical analysis of household consumption. By advancing our understanding of household decision-making processes, this project has the potential to inform policy interventions and improve the design of social programs."
