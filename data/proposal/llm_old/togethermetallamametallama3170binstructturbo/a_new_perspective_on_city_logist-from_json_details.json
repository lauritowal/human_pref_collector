        "Title: A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the field of city logistics by developing innovative concepts, theory, and models for designing and managing Logistics as a Service (LaaS). Our primary objective is to create a public value measurement system that integrates multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization techniques to inform city logistics planning and management. We also aim to develop principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design and theoretical frameworks for LaaS operating procedures.\n\nThrough this research, we expect to achieve three key outcomes: (1) a new theory of city logistics, (2) efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and (3) maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential scientific and practical applications in transport and logistics, as well as significant social, economic, and environmental consequences.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach brings together expertise in logistics, transportation, sustainability, and optimization to address the complex challenges of city logistics. By developing a comprehensive framework for LaaS, we aim to contribute to the creation of a more efficient, sustainable, and equitable urban logistics system that benefits both citizens and the environment. This research has the potential to transform the field of city logistics and provide a model for future urban development initiatives."
