        "Title: The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support a comprehensive, interdisciplinary research project investigating the medieval and early modern nautical chart. Despite being a crucial tool in maritime expansion, the technical and historical aspects of these charts remain among the least studied and understood. Currently, a detailed technical study of these charts is still in its infancy, necessitating a thorough examination of their origin, evolution, and use.\n\nThis project aims to address three primary research questions: the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, the technical evolution of charts over time, and their use at sea. To achieve this, we will employ a range of methodologies, including analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and the examination of manuscripts using special lighting. By unveiling hidden graphic content, characterizing main geometric features, establishing connections with navigational methods, and simulating chart construction numerically, this project will significantly advance our understanding of the medieval and early modern nautical chart.\n\nBuilding on previous work that solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this proposal seeks to tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period. The outcome of this research will have a profound impact on the History of Cartography and intellectual history at large, providing new insights into the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts and their role in shaping maritime expansion."
