        "Title: \"Temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project proposes a comprehensive analysis of the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes, drawing on Esping-Andersen's 'three worlds' framework. Focusing on the intersection of gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use, this study will explore the impact of public policies on the daily lives of individuals in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Western societies.\n\nBy employing a cross-national and historical comparative approach, this research will examine the relationships between unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, and the gender division of labor, with a particular emphasis on care provision, domestic labor, and leisure time. The study will utilize time diary data and household panel data to analyze the complexities of social inequality across different welfare regimes at the household, societal, and life course levels.\n\nThis project aims to contribute to our understanding of how modern technology, public policies, and changing social norms influence the gendered distribution of time and resources, ultimately shaping family outcomes and social inequality. By comparing East Asian and Western societies, this research seeks to identify the most effective policy interventions for promoting gender equality and reducing social inequality. The findings of this study will have significant implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working to address the pressing issue of gender inequality in diverse welfare regimes."
