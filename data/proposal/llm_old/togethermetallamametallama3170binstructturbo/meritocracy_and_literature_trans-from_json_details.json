        "Title: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, MERLIT, proposes a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation of meritocratic narratives in literature. Despite the widespread presence of meritocratic thought in contemporary society, existing research has been criticized for its enmeshment with structures of domination and privilege. Moreover, current studies have focused narrowly on Western contexts and recent developments, neglecting the formal principles and historical forms of meritocracy. \n\nTo address these gaps, MERLIT aims to explore the practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques, expanding the contextual focus to include the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. Through a comprehensive analysis of literary works from the 17th century to the present, this project seeks to offer a literary history of meritocratic thought, advance understanding of hegemonic forms in writing, and highlight literature's worldmaking role. By integrating insights from literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation, MERLIT will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between meritocracy, literature, and cultural context. This project's findings will have significant implications for our understanding of the global circulation of ideas and the role of literature in shaping cultural narratives."
