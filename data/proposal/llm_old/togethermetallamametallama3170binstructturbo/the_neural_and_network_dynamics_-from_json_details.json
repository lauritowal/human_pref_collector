        "Title: The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research proposal seeks to elucidate the neural and network mechanisms underlying social influence during adolescence, a critical period of development marked by significant changes in academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. In recent years, social media and viral risk-taking challenges have dramatically amplified these dynamics, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between social information, peer networks, and adolescent behavior.\n\nOur proposed project aims to develop a novel theoretical framework and formalize computational models that capture the dynamics of social influence in adolescence. Building on the notion that adolescents are active information seekers, we will design novel tasks and leverage functional magnetic imaging, computational modeling, and social network analyses to investigate key research questions: when do adolescents seek social information, and who do they learn from? By integrating these methodologies in a real-world experimental study, we anticipate shedding new light on the role of social information in shaping adolescent behavior, advancing our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and informing the development of targeted interventions to promote positive youth outcomes."
