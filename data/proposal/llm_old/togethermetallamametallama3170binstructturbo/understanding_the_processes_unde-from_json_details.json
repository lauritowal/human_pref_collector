        "Title: Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\n\nAbstract:\n\nSocial scientists face significant methodological challenges when examining complex relationships between latent constructs, such as values, climate change beliefs, and perceived threats. These challenges arise from the inherent unobservability of these constructs, differing processes across multiple groups, and measurement inequivalence or non-invariance. Traditional analytical approaches often lead to underestimated effects, misguided conclusions, and invalidated comparisons among constructs.\n\nThis proposed project addresses these challenges by developing and implementing a novel mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework. This innovative approach integrates clustering techniques to identify subsets of groups with common underlying processes and incorporates flexible measurement models to account for non-invariance across groups. By leveraging large-scale survey data and implementing the proposed methodology in freely available software, this project aims to provide social scientists with a more robust and accurate tool for analyzing complex societal threats, such as climate change, politics, and vaccination.\n\nThe outcome of this project will be a cutting-edge analytical framework that enables researchers to better understand the intricate relationships between latent constructs and uncover the underlying processes driving societal threats. Ultimately, this research will contribute to more informed decision-making and policy development, fostering a more resilient and sustainable society."
