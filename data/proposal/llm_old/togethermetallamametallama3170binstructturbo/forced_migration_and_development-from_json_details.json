        "Title: Forced Migration and Development: Understanding the Economic Consequences in Developing Countries\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe global forced migration crisis, with over 68.5 million displaced individuals, predominantly hosted by developing countries, necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its economic consequences. The proposed project, FORCEDMIGDEV, aims to analyze the economic implications of forced migration in developing countries through a two-part approach. \n\nFirst, the project will focus on refugee inflows, developing a structural model to estimate the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare effects across regions, and the effects of legal status for refugees. A case study on Syrian refugees in Turkey will provide in-depth insights into the economic consequences of refugee inflows.\n\nSecond, the project will investigate the impact of climate shocks on internal displacement, combining reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the effects in Brazil. A quantitative spatial model will be developed to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement in Brazil, intersecting with climate and development economics.\n\nBy addressing these critical issues, the FORCEDMIGDEV project will provide policymakers with evidence-based research to inform effective strategies for managing the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries. The expected outcomes of this project will contribute to the development of more sustainable and inclusive economic policies, ultimately improving the lives of displaced individuals and host communities."
