        "Title: Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDEN): Exploring Language Understanding Beyond Phone and Word-Based Approaches\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks to revolutionize the field of language understanding by challenging the conventional phone and word-based approach to language processing. Building on the understanding that languages have evolved over 50,000 years, with the alphabet being invented only 3,000 years ago, our research aims to explore the low-level properties of the acoustic signal that languages use to convey meaning. Focusing on the unique characteristics of the Chinese writing system, such as juxtaposed characters without intervening spaces and context dependency, we will develop a wide learning network (WLN) that can learn to recognize and process language in a more human-like manner.\n\nOur proposed WLN, consisting of two-layer networks with many thousands of units, will employ a simple error-driven learning rule to match human processing strengths and weaknesses. By advancing our research program, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of language processing, including auditory comprehension development, modeling diverse languages, speech production extension, and the development of a discrimination-based language theory. This project will contribute significantly to the current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and we request funding to support this innovative research."
