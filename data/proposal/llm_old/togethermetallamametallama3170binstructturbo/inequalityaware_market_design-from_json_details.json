        "Title: Inequality-aware Market Design: Exploring Optimal Marketplace Design with Inequalities\n\nAbstract:\n\nConventional market design often prioritizes allocative efficiency, overlooking concerns of inequality. This grant proposal seeks to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that take into account inequalities, through the development of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). Using a mechanism-design framework, we aim to create a welfare function that maximizes welfare with redistributive preferences, acknowledging private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights. Our main hypothesis posits that, when inequalities are detectable, allocative efficiency may need to be sacrificed for a desirable surplus split. This project will contribute theoretically by addressing inequality in market-design settings and distinguishing from traditional mechanism-design focuses on efficiency and revenue. The findings will provide policy guidance on distortionary market interventions, such as rent control and healthcare allocation, and offer an alternative to public-finance approaches through the tax system. By exploring the trade-offs between efficiency and equity, this project will provide valuable insights into the design of marketplaces that balance competing social objectives."
