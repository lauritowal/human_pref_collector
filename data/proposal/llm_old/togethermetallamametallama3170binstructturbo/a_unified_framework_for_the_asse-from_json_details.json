        "Title: A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\n\nAbstract:\n\nCognitive models have become a cornerstone in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, but their proliferation has led to inconsistent applications and unclear standards. To address these challenges, our proposed project aims to develop a unified framework for the assessment and application of cognitive models. By leveraging Bayesian inference foundations, our approach will provide a comprehensive program for evaluating absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, exploring efficient algorithms for parameter estimation, and applying these methods to data from popular experimental designs.\n\nOur framework will focus on three key models: drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. To further enhance the framework, we will construct plausible parameter priors, develop diagnostic experiments, assess Bayes factors for hierarchical designs, and provide model-averaged assessment of parameter changes.\n\nUpon completion, our project will set a new standard for cognitive modeling, providing a rigorous and transparent methodology. The techniques developed will be incorporated into the popular statistical software JASP, making them accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners. By advancing the field of cognitive modeling, our project has the potential to significantly impact research and practice in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology."
