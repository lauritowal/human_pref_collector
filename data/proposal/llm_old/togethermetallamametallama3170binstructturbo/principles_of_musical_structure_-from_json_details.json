        "Title: Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary grant proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of human cognition by delving into the complex relationships between auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. The project, \"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition,\" aims to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that surpasses the limitations of current context-free approaches.\n\nThrough a three-stranded approach, the project will integrate theoretical, computational, and experimental methods to achieve its objectives. The theoretical strand will focus on developing a unified syntax theory that incorporates harmonic structure and voice leading constraints, moving beyond the confines of tree-based context-free grammars. The computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, utilizing generalized parsing and graph grammars. The experimental strand will test predictions about mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences, advancing our understanding of complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures. The proposed research will have far-reaching implications for the development of music theory, cognitive modeling, and music information retrieval."
