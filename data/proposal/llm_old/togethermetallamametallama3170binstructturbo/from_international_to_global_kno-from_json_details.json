        "Title: From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project proposes a socio-historical study of the post-World War II transformation in global health governance. Focusing on the critical period between the post-war era and the 1980s, the project will investigate the transition from an international public health paradigm centered on disease eradication and UN-led initiatives to a global health framework characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public alliances.\n\nThrough a historical and anthropological lens, the project will examine the intersections of four key health areas: Tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics. Particular attention will be given to the evolving roles of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the experiences of non-Western countries, with a special focus on India.\n\nBy exploring the circulation of knowledge and practices across different levels and geographies, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the shift from the Cold War era to the current neoliberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty. The expected outcomes of this research will contribute to a more inclusive and contextualized understanding of global health, highlighting the complex interplay between local practices, international organizations, and market forces. Ultimately, this project seeks to shed new light on the complexities of global health governance and its implications for contemporary health policies and practices."
