        "Title: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism: An Empirical Investigation of Personal Experiences, Information Environment, and Aggregate Economic Shocks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research proposal seeks to understand the complex dynamics driving the rise and fall of populism and extremism. We will conduct an empirical investigation of how personal experiences, information environment, and aggregate economic shocks influence individual political decisions. Through a multi-part study, we will examine the impact of personal employment histories and information environment on voting behavior, the relationship between negative social experiences and support for populist agendas, and the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes.\n\nUsing a unique combination of datasets, including a database of over 40 million resumes, archival records on corporal punishment regulations, and self-collected data on treason cases, we will analyze the heterogeneity of responses to economic shocks and the role of individual experiences in shaping political attitudes. Our research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying the rise of populism and extremism, shedding light on the complex interplay between personal, social, and economic factors. By advancing our knowledge of these dynamics, this project will contribute to the development of effective strategies for mitigating the appeal of populist and extremist ideologies."
