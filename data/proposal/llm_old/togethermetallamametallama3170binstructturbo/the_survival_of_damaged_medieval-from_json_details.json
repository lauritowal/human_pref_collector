        "Title: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics (POLYCHROME)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project, POLYCHROME, aims to investigate the survival and conservation status of medieval polychromed heritage in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. This study will focus on painted, gilded, and wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces that have undergone transformation from devotional objects to cultural heritage.\n\nHistorical events, such as the break with the Roman Catholic Church in Sweden (1527) and Denmark-Norway (1537), have led to the hypothesis that damage to these objects may be linked to iconoclastic acts. However, current assumptions attribute damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism. This project seeks to address the research gap in understanding the status, volatility, and repairs of these objects, which is hindered by a lack of archival evidence and secondary paints masking information.\n\nUtilizing technologies from the natural sciences, the research will conduct an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collect material data, map restorations and repairs, and establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies. The expected outcomes of the project include a deeper understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism on Nordic polychromed heritage and the influence of this knowledge on training priorities for heritage conservation and management.\n\nThis project will contribute to the ongoing debate about heritage values and future care, ultimately informing strategies for the preservation and conservation of these valuable cultural artifacts."
