        "Title: Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis prospective longitudinal study seeks to develop a comprehensive, integrative model of adaptations that occur in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. We will investigate the timing and progression of brain changes, cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures in 100 nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, 50 nulliparous women with partners undergoing full-term pregnancy, and 50 control nulliparous women. \n\nThrough five sessions spanning pre-pregnancy, intra-pregnancy, and postpartum periods, we will collect neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data to examine the dynamic interplay between biological, psychological, and environmental factors influencing maternal adaptations. Furthermore, we will identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations and integrate our findings within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. \n\nOur study aims to provide a longitudinal RDoC-based model of maternal adaptations, as well as intermediate longitudinal evaluations and cross-sectional analyses at key time points. By elucidating the complex processes underlying motherhood, this research will contribute to the development of novel interventions and treatments for pregnancy-related mental health disorders, ultimately improving maternal and infant well-being."
