        "Title: From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the face of rising protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies in Europe, the conventional wisdom on international trade is being challenged. This project seeks to address the limitations of traditional trade models that assume homogeneous firms, and instead, explore the aggregate implications of firm-level heterogeneity in international trade. The proposed research aims to highlight key dimensions where conventional trade models need to be revisited, and provide new insights into the patterns of international trade, welfare effects, and the role of government intervention.\n\nThrough four interconnected work packages, this project will investigate the impact of firm heterogeneity on market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities. The research will provide a nuanced understanding of how firm-level differences shape country-level economic performance, trade agreements, and responses to trade liberalization. The findings of this project will contribute to the development of more effective trade policies and a deeper understanding of the complexities of international trade in the context of rising protectionism and globalization discontent."
