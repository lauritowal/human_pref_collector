        "Title: Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project challenges the prevailing view of prehistoric European societies as either egalitarian or overtly hierarchical, proposing instead that inequality manifested situationally. By integrating osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, we will empirically test alternative models of inequality and deathways in Peninsular Italy across three key periods: the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), the Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and the Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC). Our analysis will focus on 200 individuals per period, examining how inequality affected lives and the role of ancestors in shaping social dynamics.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between death, power, and social inequality in prehistoric Europe. By reevaluating traditional narratives of social organization, this project seeks to provide a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of the social and cultural transformations that occurred during these pivotal periods. Our findings will contribute significantly to the field of archaeology, shedding new light on the lives and deaths of prehistoric Europeans and the ways in which their societies were structured and transformed over time."
