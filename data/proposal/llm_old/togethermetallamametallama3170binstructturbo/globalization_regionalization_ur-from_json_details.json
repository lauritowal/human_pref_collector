        "Title: Globalization, Regionalization, Urbanization: An Analysis of the Worldwide Maritime Network since the Early 18th Century\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposed project seeks to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime perspective across nearly 300 years. By leveraging vessel movement data from the Lloyd's List register, we aim to create dynamic and interactive visualizations of the global maritime network, revealing its evolution and impact on urban and regional development.\n\nOur research objectives are threefold: (1) to map the spatial distribution of maritime flows and develop a geomatics visualization platform; (2) to analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links using graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks; and (3) to study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development by integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions.\n\nThrough this comprehensive analysis, we will investigate the dynamics of network expansion, shrinkage, concentration, and polarization, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. By exploring the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development since the early 18th century, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between globalization, regionalization, and urbanization."
