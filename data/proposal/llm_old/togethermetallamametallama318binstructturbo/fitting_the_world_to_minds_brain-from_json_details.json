        "**Title:** Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Recent advances in brain signal analysis provide a unique opportunity to overcome conceptual and technical challenges in studying social information representation. Our proposed approach involves studying social interaction under naturalistic settings and measuring temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals using novel signal analysis methods and experimental techniques. We will investigate three key hypotheses: (1) selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, (2) similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with synchronous brain activity, and (3) intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow. The results of this project will improve our understanding of brain dynamics of social interaction, potentially contributing to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. This study is expected to contribute significantly to the field by providing a more nuanced understanding of how we navigate and interact with the social world."
