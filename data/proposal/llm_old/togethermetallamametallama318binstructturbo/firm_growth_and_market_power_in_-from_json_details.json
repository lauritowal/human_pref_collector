        "**Title:** Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, BIGlobal, aims to investigate the sources of firm growth and market power in a globalized world. Building on the research objectives of the European Commission (2007), our project seeks to provide insights into welfare and policy implications of firm behavior in international trade. We will adopt a comprehensive approach, incorporating richer firm behavior in models of international trade, and examining the impact of trade and industrial policies on growth, particularly in less developed markets.\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical and empirical research, BIGlobal will address four key research questions: (1) how to ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms have market power; (2) how domestic policies affect small farmers' gains from trade; (3) how industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages; and (4) the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector.\n\nOur expected outcomes include expanding the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy, and providing a basis for informed policymaking. This project will be conducted over a period of five years, with a focus on developing economies and incorporating rich data. The results of BIGlobal will contribute to a better understanding of firm growth and market power in a globalized economy, enabling policymakers to make more informed decisions."
