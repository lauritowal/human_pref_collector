        "**Title:** Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity,\" seeks to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. The project, dubbed \"BabMed,\" aims to explore the latest phase of Babylonian medicine in the Babylonian Talmud, which is written in Aramaic. By relying on native taxonomies and comparing with neighbouring medical systems, this study will test the hypotheses that cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. The research will also challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories by highlighting the significant contributions of Babylonian medicine. The study will provide a new paradigm for knowledge transfer, shedding new light on the scientific thinking of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia."
