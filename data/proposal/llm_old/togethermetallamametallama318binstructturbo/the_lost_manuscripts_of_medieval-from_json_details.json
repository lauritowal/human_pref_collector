        "**Title: The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa)**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa) aims to unravel the mysteries of text transmission in medieval Europe. This interdisciplinary project seeks to understand how human cultures evolve through the transmission of written artefacts, determine the role of chance in their preservation or loss, and analyze the processes of copying, transformation, and destruction. By combining artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise, LostMa will employ stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations to model the transmission of chivalric literature in the European context. The project will focus on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, spanning Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages. Through deep learning for large-scale data collection, LostMa will investigate the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons, providing new insights into the dynamics of cultural transmission. By shedding light on this complex process, LostMa will contribute to a deeper understanding of human cultural evolution and the role of written artefacts in shaping our shared heritage."
