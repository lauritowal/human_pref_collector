        "**Title:** We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis collaborative research project aims to explore the pivotal role of digital media in shaping transnational memories surrounding disappearances, using the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico as a case study. By examining the interplay between digital media, citizen engagement, and counter-movements against the Mexican government, this project sheds light on the significance of new media in mobilizing and sustaining social movements. \n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach combining theoretical perspectives on disappearance as a crime and digital memory with a comprehensive analysis of the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World, this project seeks to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. \n\nA comparative aspect of this research involves examining Mexico's case in relation to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, highlighting similarities and differences in the construction of transnational memories across borders. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries of digital memory, with implications for the fields of sociology, media studies, and human rights."
