        "**Title:** The Real Estate/Financial Complex: A Multiscale and Interdisciplinary Exploration\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to establish a comprehensive research project, The Real Estate/Financial Complex, to investigate the intricate relationships between real estate, finance, and state involvement. Spanning over 15 years, the proposed project (2007-2022) will focus on bridging the existing research gap by examining the connections between real estate and finance, as well as interactions across different scales.\n\nUtilizing an internationally comparative approach, the project will employ a unique metaphor, the real estate/financial complex, to center attention on the interactions between these sectors. This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a postdoctoral researcher, three PhD students, and the Principal Investigator.\n\nThe project will involve three primary components:\n\n1. Internationally comparative research on quantitative and qualitative shifts in the real estate/financial complex.\n2. National mappings and local/urban case studies by PhD students, each focusing on two countries.\n3. Qualitative analysis of the complex, including the role of the state, conceptualization of the complex, and global dimensions.\n\nBy filling the existing research gap and introducing a new metaphor, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the real estate/financial complex, its interactions, and the implications for policy-making and future research."
