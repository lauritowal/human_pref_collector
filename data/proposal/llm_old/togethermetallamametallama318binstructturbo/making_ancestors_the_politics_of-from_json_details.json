        "**Title:** Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the politics of death in prehistoric Europe, with a specific focus on the manifestations of inequality during the Neolithic, Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age periods in Peninsular Italy. Contrary to traditional views of prehistoric societies as egalitarian, this project critiques the notion of overt inequality and instead posits that inequality manifested situationally, influencing the lives and experiences of individuals in prehistoric Europe.\n\nUsing osteobiography and funerary taphonomy as methodologies, we will analyze the skeletal remains of 600 individuals from each of the three defined periods. Our research goals are to evaluate how inequality affected the lives of prehistoric individuals and to understand the role of ancestors in prehistoric societies. This project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities of prehistoric societies and contribute to our knowledge of the politics of death in prehistoric Europe."
