        "Here's an abstract for the grant proposal within the 290-word limit:\n\n**Title:** The advantages and pitfalls of elicitated online user engagement\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from business and societal perspectives. Through an empirical approach incorporating lab and field experiments, we seek to understand the underlying mechanisms of calls to action, their effects on user behavior, and the direct value they create for businesses. We will characterize the effects of calls to action in multiple product domains and assess the societal implications of user engagement expectations.\n\nPreliminary results suggest that calls to action have significant effects on conversion and information revelation. This project will build on these findings by isolating the underlying mechanisms of calls to action and determining their value from a business perspective. To achieve this, we will collaborate with a leading website-development service provider, leveraging their expertise in the freemium business model.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project is twofold: it will provide an economic understanding of social computing, and it will shed light on the societal implications of user engagement expectations. By exploring the advantages and pitfalls of elicitated online user engagement, this project will contribute to the development of more effective and user-friendly online experiences, ultimately benefiting both businesses and society as a whole."
