        "**Title:** Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nWe propose a highly interdisciplinary research project, \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine,\" aimed at validating a set of 10 provocative claims related to long-term memory formation and maintenance. These claims, which include the existence of 'Grandmother Cells' and the role of 'Neocortical Dark Matter' in memory storage, have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human neural processes and inspire the development of artificial computing architectures.\n\nThis project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development. We will utilize a range of experimental paradigms, including fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients, to study the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories. Additionally, we will develop computer simulations using networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity and design bio-inspired hardware mimicking brain memory systems.\n\nBy testing these claims, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying human memory and to explore the potential for developing artificial systems that can mimic brain memory processes. This research has the potential to yield significant advances in both cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and could ultimately lead to the development of more efficient and effective memory-based computing architectures."
