        "**Title:** SLaVEgents: Uncovering the Agency of Enslaved Persons in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, SLaVEgents, seeks funding for a comprehensive research project that investigates the pivotal role of enslaved persons in shaping ancient societies and cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. Our interdisciplinary team of 19 researchers, led by a Principal Investigator and comprising senior researchers, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD candidates, will analyze the agency and experiences of enslaved individuals across various languages and cultures, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nThrough a digital prosopography, publications, workshops, and an international conference, we aim to produce cutting-edge research and knowledge that will significantly contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics between enslavement, social change, and cultural expression in the ancient world. Our research outputs will include a monograph, collective volumes, articles, PhD dissertations, and a dedicated website, ensuring sustainable impact and accessibility of our findings. By shedding light on the agency of enslaved persons, SLaVEgents will provide a nuanced and multifaceted understanding of the ancient world, challenging traditional narratives and fostering a more inclusive and equitable interpretation of history."
