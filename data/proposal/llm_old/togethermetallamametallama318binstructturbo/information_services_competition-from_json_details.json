        "**Title:** Information services: competition and externalities\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of the economics of information services by examining the role of externalities in shaping strategic interactions, production, and exchange of information services. The project will investigate how one-sided and two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and complements of information services and physical infrastructures influence the behavior of players in the information services market.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the project will be divided into four parts: Background theory, Virtual layer, Physical layer, and Competition policy. Each part will employ a distinct approach, including the development of relevant theory, empirical investigation, and original dynamic investment models. The project will leverage proprietary data from e-commerce platforms to inform the empirical investigation.\n\nThe proposed research will yield novel insights into the economics of information services, enabling the development of tools for competition policy makers. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between players in the information services market, with implications for competition policy, investment, and pricing strategies."
