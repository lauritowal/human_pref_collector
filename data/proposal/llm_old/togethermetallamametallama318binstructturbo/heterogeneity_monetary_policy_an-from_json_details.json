        "**Title:** Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy. Leveraging HANK (Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian) models, we will develop an organizing framework to distinguish between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents, and conduct a comparative analysis of HANK and TANK (Two Agent New Keynesian) models. Our analysis will focus on the heterogeneity wedge in consumption or investment, and the channels of heterogeneity in HANK models and actual economies.\n\nBy comparing aggregate equilibrium dynamics across HANK, TANK, and RANK (Representative Agent New Keynesian) models, we will gain insights into the impact of heterogeneity on monetary policy. The proposed applications include examining the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on optimal monetary policy.\n\nThis project will provide a deeper understanding of the channels through which heterogeneity operates and inform policy decisions that account for the diversity of economic agents. The findings will contribute to the development of more effective monetary policies that take into consideration the heterogeneity of households and firms."
