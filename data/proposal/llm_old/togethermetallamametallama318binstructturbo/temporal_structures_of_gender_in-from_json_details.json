        "**Temporal Structures of Gender Inequalities in Asian and Western Welfare Regimes**\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes, with a focus on the intersections of gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use. Drawing on Esping-Andersen's 'three worlds' framework, this comparative study will examine the ways in which different welfare regimes shape the daily activities, life schedules, and unpaid work of individuals in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and how these, in turn, affect family outcomes and social inequality.\n\nThrough cross-national and historical comparative analyses, this study will explore the impact of public policies, modern technology, and the care provision on the daily lives of individuals in these societies. The study will utilize time diary data and household panel data to examine the temporal dimensions of gender inequality, including the division of labor, leisure time, and enjoyment. By analyzing these dynamics at the household, societal, and life course levels, this study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between welfare regimes, time use, and gender inequality in East Asian and Western societies.\n\nThis research has significant implications for policy-making and the development of more equitable and sustainable welfare regimes that address the needs of individuals and families in diverse contexts."
