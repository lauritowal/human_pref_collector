        "**Title:** LABFLEX: Understanding the Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled LABFLEX, aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization, technological change, and workplace transformation. We will examine the relationships between outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs, and their impacts on wage inequality and the division of resources in society.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining register data with experimental evidence on worker preferences and analysis of full-text corpus of vacancies with job attribute information, we will address key research questions. These include: Do job contract differences reflect worker preferences or technology advances? What are the impacts of job contract flexibility on wage inequality and gender wage gaps? Are workers compensated for adverse work conditions or higher income risks?\n\nThe project will draw a detailed picture of the supply and demand sides of the labor market, facilitating a comprehensive study of flexibility in job contracts. The expected outcomes of LABFLEX include new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, which will inform labor market policies and institutions. This research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex relationships between labor market flexibility, wage inequality, and the distribution of resources in society."
