        "Title: REPAC: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, REPAC, aims to bridge a significant knowledge gap in the field of Ancient Mesopotamian studies by investigating the intersection of textual form and function in literary and scholarly compositions. Specifically, we will examine the use of repetition, parallelism, and other structuring devices in clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform script and written in Akkadian. Our research focuses on three genres: literary, magical, and mantic texts, with a time period spanning the first millennium BCE. By analyzing the textual features and functions of these compositions, we seek to improve our understanding of the Ancient Mesopotamian worldview and the creative efforts that underlie their literary and scholarly methods. The expected outcome of this project is a deeper understanding of the analogical reasoning and causal effectiveness that characterized the Mesopotamian worldview, and the ways in which these features were employed to create aesthetically ornate and argumentatively effective compositions."
