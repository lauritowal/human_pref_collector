        "**Title:** The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to elucidate the complex interplay between social influence, neural mechanisms, and network dynamics in adolescents. Our research focuses on the critical period of adolescence, marked by significant developmental changes in academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. We investigate how social media and viral risk-taking challenges amplify these effects, and how adolescents actively seek and process social information.\n\nOur goals are to develop a new theoretical framework that formalizes novel computational models of social learning and to conduct an experimental study in real peer social networks. We will utilize a multi-method approach, combining the development of novel tasks, computational modeling, functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), and social network analyses.\n\nThis research will provide insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advance our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and inform the development of interventions to promote positive outcomes. By exploring the neural and network dynamics of social influence, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on adolescent development, academic achievement, and prosocial behavior."
