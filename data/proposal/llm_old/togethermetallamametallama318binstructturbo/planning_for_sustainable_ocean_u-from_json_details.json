        "**Title:** Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled PLAnT (Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change), aims to address the pressing need for a robust, integrated, and sustainable marine spatial planning (MSP) framework in Antarctica. The continent's unique environment is undergoing rapid changes, driven by global environmental shifts, which underscore the urgency of developing a comprehensive MSP framework. Our proposal focuses on incorporating climate change effects into MSP, critical for ensuring effective management of marine resources. The PLAnT project will achieve this through six objectives:\n\n1. Assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities in Antarctica's marine ecosystems\n2. Building future scenarios for sustainable ocean use\n3. Supporting area-based climate action\n4. Providing dynamic solutions for MSP\n5. Conducting governance analyses to inform decision-making\n6. Fostering a paradigm shift toward sustainability and equity in ocean governance\n\nBy addressing the complex challenges posed by contextual idiosyncrasies in Antarctica, this project seeks to inspire nations to prioritize ocean sustainability and contribute meaningfully to the global agenda. With a high potential global impact, the PLAnT project has the potential to shape the future of marine spatial planning and sustainable ocean use in the face of climate change."
