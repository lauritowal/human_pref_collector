        "**Title:** Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction (MADVIS)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled MADVIS, aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying visual deprivation's impact on the occipital cortex's organization and connectivity. Our objectives are to understand how visual deprivation at different development stages affects brain structure and function, and to leverage this knowledge to predict outcomes of sight restoration. Employing an interdisciplinary approach that combines cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, we will investigate the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight-recovery. Our expected impact includes advancing the understanding of experience-dependent brain development, bridging the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, and developing new predictive tools for sensory restoration procedures. This research has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the brain's adaptability and inform the development of novel treatments for visual impairments."
