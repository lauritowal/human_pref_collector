        "**Title:** Shared Responsibility in International Law: A Novel Framework for Cooperative Actions (SHARES)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, SHARES, seeks to redefine the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions. By exploring the complexities of shared responsibility and its diluting effects on key objectives, SHARES aims to develop a novel framework that protects the international rule of law. Our objectives include rethinking the allocation of responsibilities, addressing the issue of responsibility dilution, ensuring protection of the international rule of law, and providing remedies for injured parties.\n\nWe will uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities through a conceptual and theoretical foundation, followed by an empirical approach that employs case-studies. Our focus areas will center on principles of collective responsibility and processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies.\n\nBy addressing the challenges of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and undermining key objectives due to shared responsibility, SHARES will contribute to a more effective and accountable international cooperation system. The proposed research will provide valuable insights and solutions for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars in the field of international law."
