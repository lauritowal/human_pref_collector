        "**Title:** SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, SCALEFORES, aims to develop and test a novel methodological framework for mapping relationships between ecosystem services using existing data. This framework will address the challenge of reliably mapping relationships between multiple ecosystem services, enabling multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. The project will examine scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and underpinning social and ecological variables, and create maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services.\n\nTo achieve this, the project will utilize a range of data sources, including land cover, soil type, and human population density, and validate the methodology against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe. The focus region of Europe is chosen due to its comprehensive data on ecosystem services globally. The anticipated outcomes of this project include accurate maps of relationships between ecosystem services and increased ability to map distributions of ecosystem services.\n\nBy providing a scalable and reliable method for mapping ecosystem services, SCALEFORES will have significant implications for ecosystem management and conservation, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and resilient landscapes. This project will provide valuable insights and tools for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working towards ecosystem-based management."
