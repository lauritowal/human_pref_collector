        "**Title:** In Praise of Community: Shared Creativity in Arts and Politics in Italy (1959-1979)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"In Praise of Community: Shared Creativity in Arts and Politics in Italy (1959-1979),\" seeks funding to explore the intersection of performing arts and counterculture practices in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. The project, \"INCOMMON,\" will study the collaborative practices of Italian artists, contextualize their works, and highlight their significance both locally and internationally. By applying the concept of \"will-to-the-common\" to counterculture art, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the artistic communities that emerged during this period.\n\nThrough innovative digital archive visualization and a new modeling of performing arts knowledge and interpretation, we will create a digital archive of Italian artists' performances and preserve the country's performing arts heritage. This project will engage with historical, philosophical, and artistic debates, as well as sociological and social network theory perspectives. The proposed research outcomes will contribute significantly to the field of performing arts studies, providing a unique and nuanced understanding of the role of community in shaping artistic expression."
