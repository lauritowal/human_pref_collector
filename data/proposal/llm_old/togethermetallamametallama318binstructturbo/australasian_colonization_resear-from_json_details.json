        "**Abstract:**\n\nTitle: Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa, specifically the peopling of Australasia by circa 50,000 years ago. The project aims to unravel the complexities of the first seafaring expedition, examining the when, where, who, and how of this pivotal event.\n\nUtilizing a multidisciplinary approach, integrating archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics, the research will focus on the Sunda (South East Asia) and Sahul (Australasia) regions. Key objectives include identifying submerged prehistoric sites, resolving questions of demography and dating using mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, and enhancing our understanding of palaeoshoreline and tidal regimes.\n\nBy combining offshore and onshore environment research, this project expects to refine knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, shed light on human origins, population dynamics, and migration, and gain insights into the technological and cognitive aspects of seafaring. Ultimately, this research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the earliest human colonization of Australasia, addressing fundamental questions about human evolution and migration."
