        "**Title:** The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the causal effects of public policy and income on child health and human capital in Spain over a 35-year period. Building on the fetal origins hypothesis, we hypothesize that fetal and early childhood development are shaped by household resources, parental time, and access to medical treatments and family planning services. We will employ large-scale data analysis and state-of-the-art econometric techniques to examine the impact of various interventions and shocks, including household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, and aggregate demand shocks.\n\nOur study will focus on the \"missing middle\" period, examining the ages of 0-15. Outcome measures will include hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. We will also explore potential channels through which policy affects child health and human capital, such as family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns.\n\nThis project will provide valuable insights into the policy implications of our findings, informing evidence-based policy decisions to promote child well-being and development. By shedding light on the causal effects of public policy and income on child health and human capital, this research has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of economics and inform policies that benefit vulnerable populations."
