        "**Title:** Rethinking China's Model of Urban Governance\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to reexamine the governance model of China's rapidly urbanizing regions, a development of world-historical significance. The proposed project aims to bridge theoretical and policy gaps in understanding state entrepreneurialism in China, a concept that has received increasing attention in recent years. Through a multi-scalar investigation of neighbourhoods, cities, and regions, this research will engage with Chinese researchers and policymakers, and employ ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews to provide a nuanced and grounded explanation of China's urban governance.\n\nThe study will focus on six case studies, covering diverse regions, including coastal, central, and western China. It will examine recent national strategic projects and their implications for urban governance, amidst the backdrop of the UN-endorsed New Urban Agenda and escalating trade tensions. By offering a unique indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation, this research will contribute significantly to the development of entrepreneurial urban governance theory. The project aims to produce six workshops and a publication series, shedding new light on China's urban governance and its implications for the world."
