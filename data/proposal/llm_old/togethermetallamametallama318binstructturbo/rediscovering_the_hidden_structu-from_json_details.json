        "**Title:** Rediscovering the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to write a new history of the Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity, a period marked by significant transformation and continuity. Our multidisciplinary team of three researchers, comprising experts in classical jurisprudence, papyrology, and historical analysis, will explore the persistence of a high-level legal culture in the face of turmoil and upheaval.\n\nThrough the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations, as well as the study of legal texts' manuscript transmission, we seek to understand the role of classical jurists in shaping the legal landscape of Late Antiquity. Our research will focus on the transmission of juristic texts, the relationship between these texts and the works of Roman jurists, and the impact of emperors' legislation on the development of Roman law.\n\nThis project will produce several key outputs, including a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, and a book on Justinian as a lawgiver. The project will culminate in a final international conference on legal culture, bringing together European scholars to share their findings and perspectives.\n\nBy shedding new light on the hidden structure of juristic texts and patterns of thought in Late Antiquity, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of Roman legal culture during a pivotal period in the history of Western law."
