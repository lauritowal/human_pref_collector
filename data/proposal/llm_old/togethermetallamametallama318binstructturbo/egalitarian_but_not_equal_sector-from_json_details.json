        "**Title:** Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials (WAGE)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe WAGE project aims to advance our understanding of the gendered nature of collective bargaining and its impact on wage differentials across sectors. Despite efforts to close the global average gender pay gap of 20%, and the European average of 13%, empirical evidence suggests that sectoral wage formation remains a critical factor in perpetuating wage disparities. This project seeks to theorize the interplay between collective bargaining, sectoral characteristics, and gendered wage differentials in the metal and nursing sectors of Germany, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nUsing ethnographic research, the WAGE project will investigate how daily practices in collective bargaining rounds influence wage outcomes in these sectors. It will also examine how actors embedded in these sectors relate to wage norms and sectoral gendered wage differentials. By comparing and synthesizing existing histories of collective bargaining and gender pay differentials in the selected countries, this project will provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics shaping wage disparities. The findings of the WAGE project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the sectoral and gendered dimensions of collective bargaining and inform policy interventions aimed at reducing wage inequality."
