        "**Title:** Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the complex interplay between family, work, and health outcomes among men. As societal expectations and family roles continue to evolve, men are increasingly facing challenges in balancing their responsibilities and maintaining optimal health and cognitive function. Despite the growing evidence of gender disparities in health, the focus has predominantly been on women. This proposed study seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining the changing family and working lives of men and their impact on health and cognition across various life stages.\n\nUtilizing a mixed-methods approach, combining register data, survey data, and genetic data from the Norwegian population, this study will disentangle the selection and causality of factors influencing men's health and cognition. By analyzing cohort and period differences, the work-face interface, and the male breadwinner model, this research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the evolving roles of men and their consequences for their health and well-being. Ultimately, this study will inform strategies to improve men's health and cognition, ultimately contributing to a more equitable society."
