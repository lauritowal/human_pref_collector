        "**Title:** How Nature Affects Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Systems\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the intricate relationship between nature and cooperation in common pool resource systems. Our research aims to elucidate how natural systems shape the preferences and incentives of economic agents, ultimately influencing their management of shared resources. We propose to explore three key mechanisms through which nature exerts its influence: (1) tipping points and thresholds that encourage cooperation, (2) the volatility of resource abundance, which affects community-based management, and (3) the interaction between leadership and the natural environment, fostering cooperation and overcoming common-pool dilemmas.\n\nUsing a combination of theoretical and statistical approaches, we will collect and analyze data from a three-continent study, covering diverse socio-economic and environmental contexts. By identifying the circumstances under which natural preconditions and social settings promote sustainable use of renewable resources, our research will contribute significantly to the fields of economics and sustainability science. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners, enabling them to develop more effective strategies for managing common pool resources in a sustainable and equitable manner."
