        "**Title:** ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to develop and test a comprehensive intervention to promote active ageing among older adults. Building on the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of active ageing, our study will (1) develop a scale to assess active ageing with dimensions of ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy; (2) examine the determinants and modifiers of active ageing; and (3) evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention that incorporates counselling, information technology, and volunteer support.\n\nOur research design involves a cross-sectional study with a sample of 1000 adults aged 75-85, as well as a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants to test the intervention. We will analyze pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago to investigate cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. This study will provide novel insights into the preconditions for active ageing and contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for promoting active ageing.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the development of a new scale for active ageing, training for young scientists, and the advancement of new concepts and theory development in the field. This project has the potential to inform policy and practice, ultimately promoting healthy ageing and improving the quality of life for older adults."
