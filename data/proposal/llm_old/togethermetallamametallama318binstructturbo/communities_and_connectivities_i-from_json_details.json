        "**Title:** Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to undertake a comprehensive and interdisciplinary investigation of Iron Age communities in Britain and their continental neighbours, spanning the period from 800 BC to AD 100. Leveraging cutting-edge methodologies, including ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological approaches, our research team will examine the genetic, demographic, and social dynamics of these ancient populations. We aim to map genetic clusters, address population movement, and explore inter-regional connectivity, shedding new light on the social dynamics and household compositions of Iron Age communities.\n\nOur study will involve the analysis of over 1,000 individuals from the UK and 250 from across Europe, providing the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. The expected outcomes of this research will be a new vision of Iron Age communities, one that highlights the complexities of social inequality, gender-specific mobility, and familial relationships. Ultimately, this project will serve as a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of ancient human societies."
