        "**Abstract:**\n\nTitle: The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to reframe the narrative of global economic change and capitalism by investigating the origins of modern industrial capitalism in 16th-18th century Asian ports. Our research aims to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, and to understand the interactive roles of European and local merchants in shaping global trade.\n\nThrough the integration of large archival repositories and global collaborations, our project will examine over 150 factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development. By exploring the economic activities in imperial trading centers, we will contribute to the decolonization of the history of capitalism and challenge dominant Eurocentric perspectives.\n\nThis 5-year research project will advance our understanding of the complex dynamics of global trade, economic dynamism, and the development of modern capitalism. By shedding new light on the Asian origins of global capitalism, we will provide a more nuanced and inclusive account of the history of capitalism, with significant implications for fields such as economic history, global studies, and social science."
