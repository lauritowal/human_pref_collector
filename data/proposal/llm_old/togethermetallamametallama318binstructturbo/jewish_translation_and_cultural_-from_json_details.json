        "**Title:** Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to reevaluate the process of modernization in early modern Jewish culture by examining the role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages. During this period, Jewish translators actively engaged with their sources, resulting in a distinctly Jewish corpus in dialogue with majority culture. Our proposal aims to provide the first comprehensive study of these translations, shedding new light on the intercultural encounters between Christians and Jews at the onset of modernity.\n\nThrough a thorough analysis of translated texts, historical documents, and cultural artifacts, this project will challenge the traditional notion of Jewish modernization as a radical break with tradition. Instead, it will demonstrate how the importation of new ideas transformed Jewish culture, contributing to the development of a unique Jewish modernity.\n\nBy exploring the complex dynamics of cultural transfer and translation, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between Jewish and Christian cultures during the early modern period. The proposed research will have significant implications for the study of Jewish history, literature, and culture, and will provide a new paradigm for understanding the early modern \"Jewish book\" and Jewish modernization."
