        "**Title:** Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a novel non-unitary modeling framework for household consumption analysis, integrating marriage market dynamics and revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems. Our objectives are to (i) open the intrahousehold \"black box\" using aggregate consumption information, (ii) avoid parametric assumptions on decision processes, and (iii) provide a detailed description of the intrahousehold decision process.\n\nTo address the challenges of unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions, we will employ a nonparametric approach. Using pooled cross-section data sets, we will estimate the parameters of household demand systems, providing new insights into the dynamics of household consumption. This research will contribute significantly to the literature on household decision-making, offering a more comprehensive understanding of household behavior and its implications for policy-making."
