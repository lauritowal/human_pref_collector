        "**Title:** The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine, and Policing\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, \"The Future of Prediction,\" aims to investigate the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and its consequences for social institutions. We will focus on the domains of insurance, medicine, and policing, which increasingly rely on Big Data and Machine Learning techniques for forecasting and decision-making. Our research will examine the social implications of algorithmic prediction, including the individualization of prediction, the undermining of mutualization principles, and the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods. We will also explore the challenges of bias in predictive models and the distinction between prevention and repression.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from the social sciences, probability calculus, and uncertainty management, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of algorithmic prediction on social institutions. The findings of this research will inform policymakers, practitioners, and the general public about the potential benefits and risks of algorithmic prediction and will contribute to the development of more equitable and transparent predictive models."
