        "**Title:** Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a novel, unifying conceptual and neural framework that elucidates how reward influences human cognition. By integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information, this project aims to extend our understanding of reward effects and their neural underpinnings. Employing optimized neuroimaging methods, we will investigate neural activity associated with reward processing.\n\nThe proposed research has significant implications for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. By addressing the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind, we will provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying motivation and cognitive operations. Furthermore, this project will explore disturbances in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson's disease. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of effective treatments and interventions for these conditions, ultimately improving the lives of individuals affected by them."
