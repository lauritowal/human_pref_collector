        "**Title:** Sustainable and Healthy Food Solutions: System Dynamics and Trade-Offs\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe FLORA project proposes an innovative, systemic approach to transform global agri-food production, trade, and consumption towards sustainability and improved health. This project aims to contribute to the global transformation by creating essential evidence to identify and implement shifts in practices and behaviors. Through the diagnosis of integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems, identification of key threats and opportunities, and tailored solution evaluation using an interdisciplinary modeling framework, FLORA will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics.\n\nThis project focuses on global sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption. Led by an experienced principal investigator, FLORA will build on an excellent track record of interdisciplinary research on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts. By taking a systemic approach, this project will provide crucial insights for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers to drive sustainable and healthy food solutions worldwide."
