        "**Title:** Globalization, Regionalization, Urbanization: An Analysis of the Worldwide Maritime Network since the Early 18th Century\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive analysis of the world economy from a maritime perspective across 300 years (1734 - present). Leveraging the Lloyd's List register, a rich dataset of vessel movement records, the project aims to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy. The main objectives are threefold: (1) to create dynamic and interactive visualizations of maritime flows and their spatial distribution, (2) to analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links using graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks, and (3) to study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development, focusing on the evolution of port cities and hinterlands, as well as inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks.\n\nThis project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between globalization, regionalization, and urbanization, shedding light on the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development over nearly three centuries. The outcomes of this research will be crucial for policymakers, urban planners, and scholars seeking to understand the dynamics of global economic systems and their spatial implications."
