        "**Title:** Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nSocietal threats, such as climate change, vaccination hesitancy, and political polarization, pose significant challenges to social cohesion and well-being. However, current evidence on these issues is often hindered by methodological limitations, including the indirect observability of constructs, differing processes across numerous groups, and measurement inequivalence. To address these challenges, this research project proposes the development and application of a mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework. This innovative approach will utilize clustering to identify subsets of groups with common underlying processes, while also accounting for non-invariance in measurement models. By leveraging large-scale survey data and freely available software, this project aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between societal threats, risk perception, and susceptibility to misinformation. The proposed research will contribute to the advancement of social science methodologies and shed new light on pressing societal issues, ultimately informing evidence-based policies and interventions."
