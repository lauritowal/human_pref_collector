        "**Title:** The multiple LAYERS of childhood adversity: A Unified Data Infrastructure for Life Course Analyses\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to establish a comprehensive data infrastructure for analyzing multiple layers of childhood adversity in a population of 2 million individuals across three generations. By integrating data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework, this project seeks to elucidate the long-lasting effects of intersecting biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental adversities on individuals and communities. Current research primarily focuses on social adversity; this initiative will redirect attention to the multiple layers of adversity that impact child development and inform targeted support for vulnerable populations.\n\nThis project will unravel the dynamics of change in the relationships between adversity and health outcomes, identify key mechanisms that perpetuate generational cycles of disadvantage, and provide a data-driven framework for policymakers to simulate and evaluate nationwide interventions. By advancing our understanding of the complex systems underlying childhood adversity, this research will ultimately contribute to improved health equity and more effective support for children and families."
