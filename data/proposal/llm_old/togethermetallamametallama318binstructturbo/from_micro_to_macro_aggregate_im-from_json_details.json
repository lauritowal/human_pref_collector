        "**Title:** From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to revisit the conventional wisdom on international trade in light of firm heterogeneity. In the context of Europe, where protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies are on the rise, our study seeks to understand the patterns of international trade and their associated welfare effects. We investigate how firm-level heterogeneity influences allocative efficiency, optimal trade policy design, comparative advantages, and exporter capabilities. Our research questions include: What determines the patterns of international trade and the associated welfare effects? Can individual incentives to trade diverge from societal objectives? Should governments intervene to promote or restrict international transactions?\n\nThis project consists of four interconnected work packages that aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the macro implications of firm-level heterogeneity in international trade. By shedding new light on the interactions between countries, sectors, and firms, our research will inform policymakers and contribute to the development of more effective trade policies. Ultimately, our goal is to maximize joint welfare among trade partners and foster a more inclusive and equitable global economy."
