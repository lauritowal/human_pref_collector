        "**Title:** Collaborative AI Counters Hate\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nWe propose the Collaborative AI Counters Hate project, an innovative solution to address AI-assisted extreme speech moderation challenges. The project aims to develop a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions, leveraging a community-based classification approach and collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries. Our goals are multifaceted, including improving AI-assisted speech moderation, developing an open access toolkit, setting procedural benchmarks, and operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle. To achieve these objectives, we will address the challenges of quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets, as well as the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural contextualization.\n\nBy tackling online hate speech and disinformation, this project will contribute to a safer and more inclusive online environment. We believe that a collaborative, bottom-up approach to AI development will yield more effective and responsible AI-assisted solutions. We seek funding to support the development and implementation of the AI4Dignity project model, bringing together experts from diverse fields to create a more just and equitable digital landscape."
