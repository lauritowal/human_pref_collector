        "**Title:** Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge between Brain and Mind\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to establish a novel framework for integrating cognitive science and systems neuroscience through the development of neurocomputational models that reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function. Our research will focus on converging experimental and theoretical approaches to understand the nature of mental processes and how they arise from neural machinery. We will investigate complex mental behaviors and underlying cognitive processes, map neural systems and their function, and develop methods and tools to bridge the gap between brain and mental behavior.\n\nOur project will employ a range of interdisciplinary methods, including experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies. The ultimate goal is to secure methods and tools for systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience, enabling a deeper understanding of neurological patients' impairments and improving clinical management and treatment. By developing a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition, we will provide a unique opportunity to mimic normal and impaired behavior, connect neuroanatomy and cognition, and ultimately advance our understanding of the complex relationships between brain and mind."
