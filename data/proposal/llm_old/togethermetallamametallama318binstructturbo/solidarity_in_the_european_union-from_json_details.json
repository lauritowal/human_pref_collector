        "Title: Solidarity in the European Union: Developing a Normative Model for Inter-State Relations\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Solidarity in the European Union,\" aims to develop a comprehensive normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1) and apply it to central issues in the EU. The project will address key challenges, including free movement of persons, burden-sharing in the EU's refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession. By providing a normative account of solidarity in the EU context, this research seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between EU member states and institutions. The proposed project will have significant implications for EU policy-making and decision-making, and will inform the development of more effective and equitable solidarity mechanisms."
