        "**Title:** CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to develop a novel theory explaining the persistent coordination challenges in growing policy regimes, particularly in the context of climate policy integration in the European Union (EU). Despite the EU's ambitious 2050 net-zero target, current policy regimes remain poorly coordinated, threatening its achievement. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies between policy regimes.\n\nUsing a combination of quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, comparative case studies, and advanced network analysis, this project will reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, and identify system-level solutions. Comparative analysis will focus on the EU and selected member states, examining coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project will provide valuable insights and advice to improve climate policy integration in the EU, contributing to the broader debate beyond climate policy. This research will advance our understanding of complex policy integration processes, ultimately informing more effective policy reforms and better coordination mechanisms for achieving the EU's climate goals."
