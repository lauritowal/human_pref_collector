        "**Title:** The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents. We will employ a multi-faceted approach, incorporating neuroimaging and psychological testing, to examine the changes in brain structure and function associated with caregiving tasks in both women and men. Specifically, we will conduct a longitudinal study to characterize the brain mechanisms underlying normal development of parental caregiving from before pregnancy to early parenthood. Additionally, we will conduct a cross-sectional study to investigate the effects of disrupted caregiving experiences, such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities (cleft lip and palate), on brain and behavioral outcomes of caregiving. Through advanced computational modeling, we will synthesize our findings to identify fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. This research has the potential to provide novel insights into the complex interplay between brain and behavior in parenting, ultimately informing the development of effective interventions to support new parents and promote healthy child development."
