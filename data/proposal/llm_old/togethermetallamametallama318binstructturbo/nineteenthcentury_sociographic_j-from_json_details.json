        "**Title:** Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive study of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as a foundational force in the development of social science disciplines, including ethnography and sociology. By examining the diverse corpus of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, we will analyze the representational techniques, relationships with epistemic developments, and embeddedness in socio-spatial settings of sociographic journalism. Our research will also situate journalistic sketches within the broader contexts of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines. This study aims to produce a significant series of essays, a public exhibition, a conference, a volume, and two monographs, contributing to a deeper understanding of the formation of social science knowledge in the nineteenth century. This project will provide a groundbreaking exploration of the intersections between journalism, anthropology, history, and sociology, shedding new light on the evolution of social science disciplines."
