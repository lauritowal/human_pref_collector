        "**Title:** Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, \"Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850),\" seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of 'corruption' during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the region. Focusing on the intersection of politics, economy, and culture, we aim to demonstrate how the idea of 'corruption' was reframed as a corrupting influence, and to examine its impacts on administrative, military, and commercial practices. Our research will draw on both foreign and indigenous critiques, as well as Great Power interventions, to trace the genealogy of ideas and attitudes surrounding 'corruption.' By engaging with global modernization debates and reframing historiography with scientific innovations, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between cultural, economic, and political developments in Central-South-East Europe during this period. The outcomes of this research will provide new insights into the evolution of the concept of 'corruption' and its implications for our understanding of modernization, governance, and development."
