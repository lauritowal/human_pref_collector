        "**Title:** Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple Mobilities in and out of the South China Sea\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, Transoceanic Fishers, seeks to challenge dominant assumptions about the role of fishers in state agendas through a comprehensive, transdisciplinary study of multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea. By examining the shifting practices and networks of fishers from China, Vietnam, Africa, and Oceania, this project will develop a novel theoretical and methodological framework of fishers as mobile maritime actors. Utilizing fine-grained ethnography, relational and shifting multiple mobilities, and thalassographic analysis, this research will shed light on the radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and market demand driving the expansion of illicit seafood trade. With growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood, this project will contribute significant scientific and policy value, informing sustainable fisheries management and maritime security policies. By examining the complex roles of fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers, Transoceanic Fishers will provide a critical perspective on the complexities of fisher movements and the transoceanic expansion of fishing practices."
