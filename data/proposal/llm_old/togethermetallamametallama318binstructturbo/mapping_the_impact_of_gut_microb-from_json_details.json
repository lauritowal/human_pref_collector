        "**Title:** Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research grant proposal aims to elucidate the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the human brain, with a focus on the role of the neurotransmitter GABA in modulating brain function and behaviour. Utilizing a biochemically informed approach, this interdisciplinary study will bridge the gap in our understanding of the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters on brain and behaviour.\n\nWith a genetic identity of 99% between humans, the proposed research will investigate the distinctness of gut bacteria, ranging from 40% to 90%, and their potential impact on brain GABA levels and function. This study will employ direct and proxy measures, including Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, to measure brain GABA levels in human adults.\n\nTwo work packages are proposed: (1) investigating the modulation of brain GABA levels by gut bacteria, and (2) testing the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour through a custom-made probiotic intervention. The research goal is to understand the impact of gut bacteria and probiotics on brain GABA levels and function, pushing the research frontier in individual differences in human behaviour and brain function. This study has the potential to unveil novel therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."
