        "**Title:** It Takes a Village: An Interdisciplinary Community Neuroscience Approach to Characterize Multigenerational Interactions\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, InterCom, seeks to innovate and advance our understanding of multigenerational communication through a community neuroscience approach. By combining laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and intrapersonal and interpersonal measures, InterCom aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying conversational flow, speech processing, and predictive abilities across diverse age groups. Key objectives include the development of novel stimuli and data analysis methods through the reciprocal integration of laboratory and real-world settings. Innovation lies in the novel 'community neuroscience' approach, which leverages the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control. This project will generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and inclusive society.\n\nWe will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events, co-design these events with community partners, and use data to inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of multigenerational communication and provide practical applications for improving communication across generations."
