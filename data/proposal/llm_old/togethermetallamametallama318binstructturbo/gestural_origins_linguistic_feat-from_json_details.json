        "**Title:** Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal, 'Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication', aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of the evolution of human language by investigating the systematic meaningful communication in great ape gestures. The project will examine cultural variation in ape gesture across species, physical environments, and social interactions (Objective 1). It will also determine if combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and analyze the construction of meaning (Objective 2). Furthermore, the study will compare human-ape gesture use and comprehension among adults and children (Objective 3).\n\nThrough pan-African data collection across 17 ape and 9 human groups, this research will shed light on species-specific, environmental, and social factors in gesture acquisition and use. The analysis of signal combination and the construction of meaning in ape communication will provide insights into the core language features such as social learning and syntactic structure. By exploring these features in the context of ape communication, this research addresses the fundamental question of human language evolution, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the origins of human language."
