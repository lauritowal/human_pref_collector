        "**Abstract:**\n\nTitle: Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the role of legislatures in promoting democracy in African countries with electoral authoritarian regimes. A mixed-methods design will be employed to tackle the research question, combining content analysis of parliamentary debates, full-population surveys in seven countries, social network analysis, and process tracing. The study will examine three key areas: law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness.\n\nDespite the theoretical views on the potential of elections and multi-party systems to prolong autocracies or increase democracy, the opaque nature of authoritarian regimes and limited research on African cases pose significant challenges. This project seeks to address these gaps by collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior.\n\nThe project will be led by a strong team of partner institutions in seven African countries, ensuring the feasibility and relevance of the research. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which legislatures can promote democratic values and inform policies aimed at strengthening democratic governance in Africa."
