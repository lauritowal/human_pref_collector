        "**Title:** The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support a comprehensive research program aimed at understanding the complexities of ethno-religious coexistence in diverse communities worldwide. Through a comparative and inductive approach, the proposed research program will examine how coexistence is practiced in Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. The program's objectives include understanding spontaneous coexistence practices, achieving better policy outcomes through empirical study, enlightening stakeholders about community expectations for coexistence, and exploring resources used to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. By exploring ordinary coexistence in the face of religious and ethnic diversity, this research aims to open theoretical and normative spaces for diverse approaches to coexistence and take culture and existing practice into account for diversity dilemmas. Two primary research questions will guide this inquiry: (1) how do communities accommodate difference spontaneously, and (2) what resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict? The findings of this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of coexistence and inform evidence-based policy interventions."
