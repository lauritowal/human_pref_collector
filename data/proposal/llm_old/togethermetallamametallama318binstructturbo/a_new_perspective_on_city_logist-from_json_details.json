        "**Grant Proposal: A New Perspective on City Logistics**\n\n**Title:** A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to revolutionize the field of city logistics by developing a comprehensive framework that integrates concepts, theory, and models for designing and managing logistics as a service (LaaS). The proposed project focuses on developing a public value measurement system that incorporates multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. This will enable city logistics planners and managers to make informed decisions that maximize public value and efficiency.\n\nThe project consists of three key objectives:\n\n1. Develop a public value measurement system that incorporates multiple decision-making criteria and sustainability analysis.\n2. Design principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design using network optimization techniques.\n3. Develop a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, incorporating logistics markets and learning-based optimization.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the development of a new theory of city logistics, efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential scientific and practical implications for transport and logistics, as well as social, economic, and environmental consequences. This project has the potential to transform the field of city logistics and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient urban environment."
