        "**Title:** NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NEMFCP)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nConsciousness remains one of the most enigmatic and complex phenomena in the human experience. Despite extensive research, the neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception remain poorly understood. This proposal, NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NEMFCP), aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern conscious perception by investigating the relationship between simple and complex stimuli, working memory, and attention. Our research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, combining electrophysiological recordings from human patients and non-human primates with functional imaging and perturbation methods to create a comprehensive map of the brain's functional connectome.\n\nWe will investigate how the fate of simple and complex stimuli differs across various brain regions, and how this fate is influenced by sustained interactions between the visual cortex and associative brain regions. By comparing the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli, we expect to provide novel insights into the mechanisms that give rise to conscious perception. The outcomes of this research will significantly contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of consciousness, and have the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n**Duration:** [Insert duration from the grant proposal details]\n\n**Budget:** [Insert budget from the grant proposal details]\n\n**Personnel:** [Insert personnel information from the grant proposal details]"
