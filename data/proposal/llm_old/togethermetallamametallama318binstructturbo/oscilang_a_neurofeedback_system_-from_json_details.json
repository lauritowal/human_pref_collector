        "**Title:** OsciLang: A Novel Neurofeedback System for Diagnosis and Intervention in Language and Reading Impairments\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop and test OsciLang, a wearable brain-computer-interface (BCI) neurofeedback system designed to detect and treat language disorders such as dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). The system utilizes a novel mechanism of synchronizing the brain's activity with changes in speech signals, leveraging the phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity in the delta and theta bands. By providing a real-time interface that quantifies basic parameters of brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG), OsciLang aims to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns, thereby improving literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia.\n\nThis project addresses a significant gap in the field by developing an affordable, lightweight, and portable BCI system that can operate effectively in noisy environments. The expected outcome of this project is improved literacy skills in individuals with dyslexia, thereby enhancing their brain-speech tracking capabilities. The proposed research has the potential to provide a framework and technology for enhancing reading abilities, making a meaningful contribution to the field of language and reading impairments research."
