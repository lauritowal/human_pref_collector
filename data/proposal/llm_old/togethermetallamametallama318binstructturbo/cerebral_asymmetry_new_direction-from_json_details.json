        "**Title:** CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of functional cerebral asymmetry, a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior. Building on the 150-year legacy of Broca's discovery, our project aims to explore the complex interplay between genetic and neuropsychological factors in shaping language development and its lateralization. We propose to investigate the network efficiency hypothesis, which posits that efficient network communication is essential for optimal language function.\n\nOur research will be conducted through a multi-faceted approach, combining behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralization (Project A). We will also use simulations from genetic models to examine the predictive power of twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization (Project C).\n\nFurthermore, we will examine the etiology of language and literacy impairment in individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome, using a double hit genetic model (Project D). Finally, we will investigate the relationship between rare genetic mutations, structural rearrangements, and inconsistent patterns of language laterality in individuals with departures from consistent left hemisphere language (Project E).\n\nThis research has significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of language and its development, and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for language and literacy impairment."
