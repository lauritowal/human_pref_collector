        "**Title:** Towards a computational account of natural sequential behavior\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive computational framework to understand and model sequential actions involving perceptual uncertainty and action variability. Our primary objectives are to identify and characterize perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks, and to characterize internal and external costs and benefits in the context of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will employ a range of interdisciplinary methods, including behavioral experiments, integration of psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. Our investigation will focus on a range of tasks, including classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and everyday activities such as sandwich making.\n\nBy recovering subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits, and action variability, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of human behavior and decision-making processes in complex, real-world scenarios. This research has significant implications for the development of more effective and adaptive artificial intelligence systems, as well as improved models of human cognition and behavior."
