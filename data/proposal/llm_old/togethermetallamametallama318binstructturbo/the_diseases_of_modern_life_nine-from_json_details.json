        "**Title:** The Diseases of Modern Life: Nineteenth-Century Perspectives\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, \"The Diseases of Modern Life: Nineteenth-Century Perspectives,\" seeks to explore the intersections of literature, science, and medicine in the 19th century to understand the concept of modernity and its associated health issues. Utilizing Benjamin Ward Richardson's influential work, \"Diseases of Modern Life\" (1876), as a framework, this project will examine the diseases and disorders linked to modernity, including those caused by stress, worry, and mental strain, as well as lifestyle diseases, environmental pollution, and occupational hazards.\n\nThrough a holistic and integrative approach, this project aims to track the circulation of ideas across disciplines and explore the connections between physiological, psychological, and social health or disease. By offering new perspectives on the problems of modernity, this research expects to break new ground in scholarship and contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical context of modern health-related issues. This project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the diseases of modern life, shedding light on the complex relationships between health, society, and the human experience in the 19th century."
