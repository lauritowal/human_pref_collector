        "**Title:** Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks (WIDEN)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe WIDEN project proposes a paradigm shift in language understanding by exploring the capabilities of human language beyond the traditional phone and word-based approach. Leveraging insights from Western linguistic thinking and the unique characteristics of non-alphabetic writing systems, such as Chinese, we aim to develop a novel framework for language processing. This framework will be based on wide learning networks, comprising tens of thousands of units, and will utilize a simple error-driven learning rule. Our research goal is to create a language understanding system that matches human processing strengths and weaknesses, with applications in auditory comprehension, speech production, and discrimination-based language theory development. By advancing our understanding of language beyond the current alphabet-centric approach, WIDEN has the potential to revolutionize the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, enabling more effective processing of diverse languages and enhancing our capacity for human-computer communication."
