        "**Title:** The New Flow of News: Exploring the Impact of Social Network Sites on News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project, \"The New Flow of News: Exploring the Impact of Social Network Sites on News Organization and Citizens' Political Behavior,\" aims to investigate the transformative effects of social network sites (SNSs) on the news industry and citizens' political behavior. As traditional news decline and SNS attention increases, this project seeks to explore the process by which news organizations adapt to new distribution channels and the implications for citizens' political beliefs and behavior.\n\nUsing innovative approaches, big data analysis, and in-depth designs, this study will investigate the integration of SNSs into news platforms and its effects on news production, consumption, and influence. The project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, content analysis, laboratory observations, and physiological attention indices to measure the impact of SNSs on news organizations and users' behavior.\n\nThe long-term effects of SNSs on citizens' political behavior will be measured through a two-year survey panel and web-based behavioral data. The project's findings will contribute to a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, and establish a new methodological standard in audience research. Ultimately, this study will provide crucial insights into the evolving landscape of news and its impact on citizens' political engagement."
