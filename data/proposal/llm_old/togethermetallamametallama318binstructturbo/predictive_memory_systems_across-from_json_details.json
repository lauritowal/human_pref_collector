        "**Title:** Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan,\" seeks to advance our understanding of neurocognitive architectures and the role of predictive processing in memory. Building on the predictive coding framework, we will investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of predictive processing in relation to memory across the human lifespan. Specifically, we aim to examine the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, as well as the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation and senescence.\n\nUsing a combination of predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, this project will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural mechanisms of predictive processing in children, younger adults, and older adults. We will examine the progression and conservation of predictive processing in episodic and semantic memory, as well as the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits.\n\nThe findings of this project will contribute to a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle and provide insights into the emergence of disorders in different life stages. Ultimately, this research aims to elucidate the complex interactions between predictive processing, memory, and lifespan development, with significant implications for our understanding of cognitive aging and age-related disorders."
