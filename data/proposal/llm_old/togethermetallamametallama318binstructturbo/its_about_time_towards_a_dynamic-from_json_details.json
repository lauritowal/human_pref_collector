        "**Title: It's About Time: Towards a Dynamic Account of Natural Vision**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"It's About Time: Towards a Dynamic Account of Natural Vision,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of visual perception by studying vision in a more natural and ecologically valid setting. The proposed project, TIME, aims to elucidate the dynamic processes underlying visual semantic understanding in the human brain. By employing an interdisciplinary approach that combines non-invasive human brain imaging, multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modeling, TIME will investigate how the brain integrates information from the world to make dynamic decisions.\n\nThe project consists of three key components: (1) an extensive dataset of tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes; (2) the development of novel multivariate analysis techniques to uncover the neural correlates of visual semantic understanding; and (3) a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision. The proposed research is expected to yield a paradigm shift in the study of vision, providing new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions. Ultimately, TIME will advance our understanding of the biological basis of vision and contribute to the development of more sophisticated artificial vision systems."
