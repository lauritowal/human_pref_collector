        "**Title:** \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\"\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project explores the complex dynamics of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in the context of boat refugees who have traversed the world's oceans since the 1940s. Guided by the central research question of how these notions have influenced the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum via sea routes.\n\nThrough a comparative and transnational approach, this research will examine the interactions between boat refugees, non-state actors, and state authorities, highlighting the roles played by solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping the outcomes of these journeys. The project will draw on a range of sources, including interviews with boat refugees and stakeholders, oral history, state archives, and NGO archival collections.\n\nThis project's key characteristics include a \"thinking through seas\" approach, which considers the ocean as a critical site of migration and refuge; a focus on non-state actors, who often play a significant role in providing assistance and support to boat refugees; and a comparative analysis of boat refugee experiences across time and space.\n\nUltimately, this research seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex politics of migration, refuge, and solidarity, and to inform more effective policies and practices for supporting boat refugees in the future."
