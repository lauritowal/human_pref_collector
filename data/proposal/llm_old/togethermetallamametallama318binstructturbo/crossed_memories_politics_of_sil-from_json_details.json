        "**Title:** Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, titled \"Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times\" (CROME), seeks to critically examine the memories and silences surrounding the wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements (1961-1974/5). Employing a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will investigate the complex dynamics of memorialisation and silencing triggered by these conflicts across Portugal and its former African colonies (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe).\n\nThrough a multi-stranded inquiry, CROME aims to produce innovative knowledge about war memories and silences, contrasting changes in memory and silence from the end of conflicts to the present. The project will examine historical judgments and memories in Portugal and African countries, offering a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies. By addressing traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism, CROME will contribute to a deeper understanding of the ongoing legacies of colonialism and their impact on postcolonial societies."
