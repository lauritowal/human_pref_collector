        "**Title:** Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry (STARTDIALOG)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, STARTDIALOG, aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams and their application in logical geometry. This research initiative addresses the lack of understanding of their logical properties and the underappreciated heuristic potential of these diagrams. The project will employ a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and the creation of a comprehensive diagram database to facilitate a deeper understanding of these visual representations.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the clarification and resolution of current issues in logical geometry, an accurate understanding of the methodological.Importance of Aristotelian diagrams, and a study of these diagrams as objects of independent interest. The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the field of logical geometry, with breakthroughs that will be relevant to philosophical logicians and applicable to various disciplines, including philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. This project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of logical geometry and its applications, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the subject."
