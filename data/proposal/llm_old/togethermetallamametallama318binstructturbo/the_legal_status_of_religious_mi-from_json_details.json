        "**Title:** The legal status of religious minorities in the Euro-mediterranean world (5th-16th centuries)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive research project to collect, publish, and study legal texts defining the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe. Spanning the 5th to 16th centuries, the project will explore the complex legal frameworks that governed the lives of Christians, Muslims, and other minority groups in the Euro-mediterranean world. A multidisciplinary team of scholars will analyze a diverse range of sources, including Roman law, Canon law, and national or royal law, as well as rabbinical responsa and Fatwa collections.\n\nThe project's primary objectives are to create a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, and to organize workshops and an international conference, fostering collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. The expected outputs will provide a major reference tool for scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations. This project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complex interplay between law, culture, and identity in pre-modern Europe."
