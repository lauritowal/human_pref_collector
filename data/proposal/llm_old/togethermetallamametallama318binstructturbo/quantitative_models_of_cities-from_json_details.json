        "**Title:** Quantitative Models of Cities: A Comprehensive Analysis of Economic Divergence and Urban Dynamics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project aimed at developing a cutting-edge quantitative framework to analyze urban dynamics and economic divergence across cities and countries. Building on recent theoretical breakthroughs and the availability of high-resolution data, our project will combine macroeconomic models with micro-level register data to shed new light on the complex interactions driving urban growth and decline.\n\nBy leveraging detailed Danish data and incorporating worker and firm heterogeneity, our dynamic model will enable us to address policy-relevant questions, such as the impact of urban transport infrastructure, height restrictions, and planning interventions on city development. Our research will also explore economic divergence across countries, within countries, and between cities and rural areas, providing valuable insights for policymakers seeking to promote sustainable urban development.\n\nThis project builds on the foundation laid by previous studies, including Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), and will contribute significantly to the existing literature on urban economics. By advancing our understanding of urban dynamics and informing evidence-based policy decisions, this project has the potential to make a lasting impact on the lives of millions of people around the world."
