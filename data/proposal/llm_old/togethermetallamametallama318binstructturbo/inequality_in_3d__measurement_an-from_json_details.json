        "**Title:** Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of economic inequality and its far-reaching implications for macroeconomic theory. Through a novel combination of microdata analysis and heterogeneous agent modeling, we seek to measure inequality along three critical dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth. By applying cutting-edge methodologies, including recent developments in modeling and empirical analysis, we will quantify the micro heterogeneity that matters for macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, as well as novel insights for improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools. Our findings will inform the development of current and future macroeconomic models and provide valuable lessons for policy makers regarding economic inequality. This project will contribute significantly to the ongoing debate on economic inequality and its implications for macroeconomic theory, ultimately benefiting the broader academic community and informing evidence-based policy decisions."
