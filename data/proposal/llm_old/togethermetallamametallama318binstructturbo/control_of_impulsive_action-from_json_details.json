        "**Title:** Control of Impulsive Action: Unraveling the Mechanisms and Modulating Factors\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nImpulsivity is a multifaceted construct that has far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanisms and modulating factors of impulsive action remain poorly understood. This project aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and their improvement by addressing key research questions. Our objectives include specifying the origin and control of impulsive actions, replacing current 'inhibitory control' models with more detailed multifaceted models, and explaining impulsivity and control across time and space. We will employ a multimodal approach combining behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making to investigate novel impulsive actions, the role of negative emotions, and the impact of learning on impulsive behavior. By advancing our understanding of impulsivity and its control, this project has the potential to inform the development of novel interventions and therapeutic strategies for disorders associated with impulse-control deficits."
