        "**Title:** A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to establish a comprehensive social demography of widowhood, addressing the growing relevance of widowhood in ageing societies worldwide. Despite increased survival rates and pension benefits being cut in many countries, the social and economic consequences of widowhood remain underdeveloped in research compared to divorce. This project will address these knowledge gaps by adopting an innovative, four-pillar approach: (1) examining risk and vulnerability, (2) investigating social inequalities by socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, and social support networks, (3) comparing country differences, and (4) analyzing changes over time.\n\nUtilizing high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, spanning 1985 to 2050, this project will apply advanced statistical methods to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates. The research outcomes will facilitate new insights into the challenges faced by the widowed population and their family members, ultimately informing the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems."
