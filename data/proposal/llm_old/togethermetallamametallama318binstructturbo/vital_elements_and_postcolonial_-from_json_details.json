        "**Title:** Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project titled \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town.\" The project will be conducted in Zarzis, Tunisia, and will focus on understanding the end of lives in the Mediterranean context. By employing a novel approach of \"forensics as the art of paying attention,\" this research aims to map unliveable life conditions in the city.\n\nThe project will examine five case studies: phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. This research will contribute to a decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa, develop forensics as a method for ethnographic study, and advance the concept of vital elements.\n\nThe proposed project will involve collaborations with local stakeholders, including team site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists in the Vital Elements Atelier. The research will provide valuable insights into the resources crucial for life and their interrelations in Zarzis, with potential applications for policy-making and community development."
