        "**Title:** An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, SynSig, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of interpersonal synchrony and its effects on mental health. Challenging the conventional assumption that higher synchrony equals better mental health outcomes, SynSig aims to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures and their unique relationship to mental well-being. By combining multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) and studying individuals in dyadic interactions with both humans and virtual humans, this project will develop the first multimodal feedback system for momentary deviations from synchrony signatures.\n\nThrough individual-tailored corrections of synchrony signatures, SynSig will explore the transformation of relationships into curative ones and analyze the causal inferences between synchrony changes and mental health outcomes. By uncovering the individual-specific nature of synchrony, this research has the potential to provide novel insights into the complex interplay between human interactions and mental health. The expected outcomes of this project will be evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, a deeper understanding of the multi-layered individual-specific nature of synchrony, and a better grasp of the connection between human interactions and mental health."
