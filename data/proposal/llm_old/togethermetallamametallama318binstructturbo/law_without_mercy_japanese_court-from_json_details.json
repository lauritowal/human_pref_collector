        "**Title:** Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the complex and often brutal landscape of Japanese military justice during the Asia-Pacific War (1937-45). The project, titled \"Law without Mercy,\" will examine the operation of Japanese courts-martial and military courts in East Asia and Southeast Asia, analyzing the roles of Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy soldiers in regulating violence and achieving war goals.\n\nThrough original archival research, this project will investigate how Japanese military justice was used to deter and coerce civilian populations, while also addressing the legitimacy and legality of Japan's war efforts. A key focus of the research will be the routinisation and escalation of violence, as well as the consequences of this violence for individuals and communities.\n\nBy shedding light on the historical context of military justice in Japan during this period, this project aims to provide important insights into the complexities of war and its impact on civilians. The findings will also have implications for contemporary humanitarian issues, such as the protection of civilians in conflict zones and the accountability of military personnel for human rights abuses.\n\nThis research will contribute to a deeper understanding of modern Japanese history and the development of international law, while also informing policy and practice in the fields of human rights and humanitarian law."
