        "**Title:** Crafting the Future of Work: A Pan-European Investigation of Neo-Craft Workers' Lived Experiences\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project seeks to develop a novel interpretative framework for understanding the intricate relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work. Through a multi-methodological, pan-European approach, this research will investigate the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors and geographical contexts within the EU. By exploring the subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media, CRAFTWORK aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of this emerging workforce.\n\nThis project represents a significant innovation in the field, offering the first comprehensive inquiry on 'neo-craft' work in the EU. Our unique combination of digital methods and qualitative research will enable us to rethink interpretative categories for identity and work study. By addressing the societal challenges of the future of work, CRAFTWORK will contribute to critical studies of new forms of work and offer a valuable resource for policymakers, practitioners, and academics alike."
