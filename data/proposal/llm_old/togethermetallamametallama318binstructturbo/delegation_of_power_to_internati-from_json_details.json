        "**Title:** Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the evolution of power delegation to international organizations (IOs) and its consequences over time. Building on existing theoretical frameworks, this longitudinal study (1986-2010) will analyze four prominent IOs: the European Community/European Union, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization Secretariat, the International Monetary Fund, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A comparative research design will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, including archives research, elite interviews with national and international officials, and analysis of temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design. By examining the varied authority surrendered by states to these IOs, this project aims to develop a temporal model of power delegation that enhances our understanding of power delegation consequences and advances theoretical and empirical research in International Relations. The proposed research will yield valuable insights into the complex relationships between states and IOs, with implications for global governance and international relations scholarship."
