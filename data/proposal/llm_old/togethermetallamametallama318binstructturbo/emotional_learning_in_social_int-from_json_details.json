        "**Title:** Emotional Learning in Social Interaction: A Comprehensive Investigation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research grant proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying aversive learning in social interactions, with a focus on understanding how we form emotional associations with others. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, behavioral genetics, and novel behavioral paradigms, we will identify key factors influencing aversive learning, including stimulus-bound, conceptual, and social characteristics.\n\nOur objectives are to (1) identify mechanisms of aversive learning about others, (2) identify mechanisms of aversive learning from others through observation, (3) identify mechanisms of aversive learning during interaction, and (4) build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. We predict that aversive learning will engage a social-cognitive network, an affective network, an associative network, and an instrumental/goal-directed network.\n\nThe proposed research has the potential to shed light on group conflicts, norm compliance, and social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of human social behavior. By elucidating the neural basis of social-emotional learning, this study will provide novel insights into the complex dynamics of social interaction and pave the way for the development of targeted interventions."
