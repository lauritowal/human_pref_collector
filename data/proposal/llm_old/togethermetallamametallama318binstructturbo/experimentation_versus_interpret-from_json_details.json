        "Title: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research grant proposal explores the paradigm shift in music performance from text-based to performative-based works, with a focus on experimental practices and the transferability of scientific experimentation models to music performance. Our objectives are threefold: (1) to investigate the traditional conception of music bound to historical contexts, (2) to create new paths through experimental practices, and (3) to assess the transferability of scientific experimentation to music performance.\n\nThrough material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs, we aim to contribute innovations in theory and practice, opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, and concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. This project, hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, engages with the discourse of artistic experimentation, with a focus on artistic research.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a change in the field of musical performance and an alternative to traditional 'interpretation'. By pushing the boundaries of music performance, this research has the potential to open new avenues for creative expression and pedagogical innovation."
