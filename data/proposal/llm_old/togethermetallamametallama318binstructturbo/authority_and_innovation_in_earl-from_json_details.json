        "**Title:** Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize our understanding of the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by conducting a groundbreaking study of early Franciscan thought. By challenging the conventional assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past work, this project will highlight their innovative contributions to the development of Western philosophy. To achieve this, a novel \"practice-led\" hermeneutic approach will be employed, considering the influence of practice on theory in scholastic texts.\n\nThe proposed project consists of four objectives: (1) producing a comprehensive study of the sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought; (2) identifying novelty in early Franciscan work, including the use of Islamic sources; (3) drawing connections between early and late Franciscan schools; and (4) showcasing the shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity. The expected outcome is a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought, shedding new light on the evolution of Western philosophy. This project will advance knowledge in the study of scholasticism and contribute significantly to our understanding of the intellectual heritage of the Western world."
