        "**Title:** Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Constructing a New Approach to Social Science for Better Policies\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis Horizon 2020 project, \"Knowledge For Use [K4U],\" aims to develop a novel approach to harnessing social science for the creation of more effective social policies. The project focuses on a philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation in the context of policy-making. By examining the role of values at the science-society interface, K4U seeks to address the current limitations of policy-making, including an overemphasis on knowledge production and a lack of attention to knowledge use.\n\nThrough a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U aims to provide practical insights and understanding for policymakers to design and deliberate on policies. The project's objectives include developing a balanced approach to policy-making, taking into account effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. By launching the philosophy of social technology as a new field of study, K4U is poised to make significant contributions to the practice of policy-making. Ultimately, the project seeks to empower policymakers with the knowledge and tools necessary to estimate and balance the various aspects of proposed policies, leading to more informed and effective decision-making."
