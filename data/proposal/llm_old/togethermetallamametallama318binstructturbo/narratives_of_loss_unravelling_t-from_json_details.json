        "**Title:** Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas in Europe. Building on the growing concern of prejudice towards marginalized groups and the rise of far-right parties, this research seeks to address the knowledge gap surrounding the coincidence of financial crises and increased support for such parties. By adopting a multi-method empirical approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, this study will unravel how economic hardship affects narratives of loss, which in turn trigger support for social conservative agendas. A comparative analysis of five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) with varying levels of economic hardship compensation will provide insights into the role of policy contexts in shaping public opinion. This research has significant implications for understanding the dynamics of social cohesion and the impact of economic hardship on political preferences."
