        "**Title:** Life in a Cold Climate: The Adaptation of Cereals to New Environments and the Establishment of Agriculture in Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the complex relationship between environmental adaptation and the spread of agriculture in Europe. By integrating population genomics, ecological modeling, and ancient DNA sequencing, we will assess the influence of environmental pressures on the domestication of cereals, specifically barley and wheat. Our project will investigate how these crops adapted to new environments, which in turn influenced the adoption of agriculture as the primary subsistence strategy in Europe.\n\nThrough the analysis of genomic and ecogeographical data, we will identify loci under selection in the barley and wheat genomes, correlate them with environmental variables, and date adaptation periods. The findings will be synthesized with archaeological and demographic data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human and environmental dimensions of cereal domestication in Europe.\n\nThis project will correct the current imbalance in the understanding of the domestication process and provide new insights into Neolithic population dynamics and crop productivity in Europe. The outcomes will contribute significantly to the field of archaeobotany, providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between humans and their environment during the introduction of agriculture into Europe."
