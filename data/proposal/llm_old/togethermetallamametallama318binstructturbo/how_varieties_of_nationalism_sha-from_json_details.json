        "**Title:** How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to explore the complex relationships between nationalism, electoral politics, and societal cohesion in advanced democracies. Despite the growing concern over polarization in Western societies, the role of nationalism in shaping public opinion and partisan divisions remains underexamined. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the diverse manifestations of nationalism and their impact on electoral politics.\n\nUtilizing a multi-method comparative research design, this project will contrast the conventional framework of a transnational cleavage with a new perspective that highlights the various forms of nationalism. Three work packages will be conducted to achieve this objective: (1) analyzing novel survey data to understand how public conceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions, (2) examining elite mobilization efforts based on different varieties of nationalism, and (3) exploring the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nThis research is expected to contribute significantly to academic advancements in the field of nationalism studies and enrich public debates regarding societal challenges, ultimately informing policies that foster greater social cohesion and mitigate polarization."
