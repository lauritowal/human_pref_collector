        "**Title:** Managing Performative Science: A Novel Approach to Performativity in Science\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Managing Performative Science,\" seeks to address the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of performativity in science. Performativity, a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, refers to the way in which scientific practices and outcomes are shaped by social and economic factors. Our research aims to develop a novel understanding of performativity, assess the ethical risks associated with its application, and provide a framework for the assessment and management of performative science.\n\nDrawing on insights from economics, epidemiology, and machine learning, our project will investigate the ways in which performativity influences scientific prediction and explanation, and the ethical implications of its use in various fields. By closing the lacuna in philosophical guidance on performative science, our research will provide a critical foundation for the responsible development and deployment of performative science.\n\nOur proposed project will contribute significantly to the advancement of science studies, philosophy of science, and ethics, and will have far-reaching implications for the practice of science and its applications in various domains. We believe that this research will not only provide a more nuanced understanding of performativity but also offer practical guidance for its management, ultimately promoting the integrity and reliability of scientific inquiry."
