        "**Title:** INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: What Do We Learn from French Firm-Level Data?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the relationships between innovation, firm dynamics, and growth, using a Schumpeterian theory of economic growth framework. The study focuses on several key growth factors, including innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, economic policies, and institutions. Our research design confronts theory and data to address four primary research questions: (1) how to measure productivity growth and account for new innovation factors, (2) what causal links exist between innovation and trade, (3) how fiscal and institutional changes impact entrepreneurship, and (4) how creative destruction affects social mobility and health.\n\nBy analyzing French firm-level data, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and policies driving innovation, growth, and social mobility. The research will provide insights into the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics, ultimately informing the design of effective growth policies. This study has the potential to inform policy decisions and contribute to the development of a more comprehensive economic growth strategy."
