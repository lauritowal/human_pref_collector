        "**Title:** Inference in Microeconometric Models: Exploiting Longitudinal Data for Enhanced Statistical Analysis\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop novel inference methods for microeconometric models that incorporate unobserved heterogeneity. By leveraging longitudinal data, we seek to advance the field of econometrics and enhance the performance of statistical hypothesis tests in nonlinear models. Our research will also focus on estimation of models for network data, considering these datasets as panel data, and non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models to accommodate unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables.\n\nThe proposed project has significant applications in labor force participation, import and export behavior of firms and countries, and other areas where understanding economic outcomes is crucial. Our research methodology will involve both theoretical and simulation assessments to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide a deeper understanding of unobserved differences between economic agents and their impact on economic outcomes. By developing new inference methods, we will improve the ability of researchers to analyze and interpret microeconometric data, leading to more informed policy decisions and a better understanding of the complex relationships between economic agents."
