        "**Title:** Florilegia Syriaca. The Intercultural Dissemination of Greek Christian Thought in Syriac and Arabic in the First Millennium CE\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, Florilegia Syriaca, seeks to shed new light on the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic sources during the first millennium CE. By illuminating these little-known sources, we aim to redefine the religious identity of Syriac Christians and better understand the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity.\n\nThrough the production of open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia, we will study the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors from the 8th to the 11th centuries. This project will create a cultural creativity laboratory for the Syriac florilegia, highlighting their significance as a bridge between the intellectual histories of Europe and the Middle East.\n\nOur groundbreaking endeavours will include the digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th to the 10th centuries and the study of neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors. The project's research outcomes will improve our understanding of cultural dynamics in Late Antiquity and demonstrate the role of patristic Christianity in shaping the intellectual heritage of both Europe and the Middle East. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper comprehension of Europe's current religious discourses and preserve the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians."
