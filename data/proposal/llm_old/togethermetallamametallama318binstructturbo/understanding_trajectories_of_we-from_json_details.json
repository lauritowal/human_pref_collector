        "**Title:** Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, 'Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability' (WEALTHTRAJECT), seeks funding to investigate the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses experienced by individuals over their lifetimes. The project aims to document and explain the variability in wealth trajectories, with a focus on intragenerational drivers and intergenerational relationships between family background and wealth accumulation.\n\nUsing a novel approach that combines longitudinal data from surveys and registers with original life history data on wealth, this research will apply advanced quantitative methods to identify the complex factors influencing wealth trajectories. The study will provide new insights into long-term wealth accumulation, wealth inequality, and trajectory variability, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of wealth distribution.\n\nThis project has the potential to inform policy initiatives aimed at mitigating wealth inequality and promoting more equitable economic outcomes. By shedding light on the complex relationships between family background, individual choices, and wealth accumulation, WEALTHTRAJECT will yield valuable knowledge that can be applied to address pressing social and economic challenges."
