        "**Grant Proposal:**\n\n**Title:** Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, a crucial aspect of energy homeostasis. We hypothesize that behavior has a dopaminergic substrate and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach combining computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation in both rodents and humans. Our research will explore the selection of food based on post-ingestive information, energy content, and vagus nerve information transmission in the context of health and disease, with a specific focus on obesity. Key experiments will involve human probabilistic decision-making tasks. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying post-ingestive reinforcement, this study will provide critical insights into the regulation of food intake and energy balance, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies for obesity and related disorders."
