        "Title: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, TwinPolitics, aims to investigate the socio-technical making of Digital Twins of the Ocean (DTOs) for national scientific and political purposes, and the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting. Against the backdrop of the European Commission's initiative to build a prototype DTO, our project seeks to address pressing challenges, including time pressure, persisting data gaps, and the implementation of global sustainability goals for ocean protection.\n\nOur research approach involves re-conceptualising digital twins as socio-technical relations and developing a methodological approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research. We will examine the practices, policies, and politics of DTOs in national and regional contexts, as well as their use during multilateral negotiations, in the EU, USA, and China.\n\nBy exploring the complexities of DTOs, our project aims to contribute to the development of more sustainable and equitable ocean futures. We will provide critical insights into the risks associated with DTOs, including the perpetuation of global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThis research project has the potential to inform policy-making and governance structures, ensuring that DTOs are developed and used in ways that promote sustainable ocean futures and address the pressing challenges facing the world's oceans."
