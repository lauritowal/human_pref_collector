        "**Title:** Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families (F-AI-MILY)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe F-AI-MILY project aims to investigate the intricate relationship between artificial agents and family social dynamics. By integrating knowledge from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction, we will establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to study the neurocognitive effects of artificial agents on family interactions. Our objectives include describing developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents, identifying how sustainable interactions can support households with chronic illness, and uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving these effects.\n\nThrough a comprehensive methodology that combines behavioural and brain measures, we will investigate the impact of artificial agents on family members' attitudes and behaviours, test the effects of long-term interactions on child development, and guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households. By taking an interdisciplinary and neurocognition-at-home approach, this project will provide unprecedented insights into the social dynamics of families and ultimately change maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness."
