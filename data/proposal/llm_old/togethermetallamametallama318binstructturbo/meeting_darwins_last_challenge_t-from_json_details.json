        "**Title:** Meeting Darwin's Last Challenge: Toward a Global Tree of Human Languages and Genes\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to address a longstanding challenge in historical classification of species and populations by integrating molecular biology with linguistic research. Building on the pioneering work of Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994), we propose an innovative approach to language classification that leverages the latest advances in formal and typological linguistics. Our method, grounded in grammatical evidence, offers unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, enabling the measurement of linguistic distances between remote populations.\n\nBy combining this novel linguistic approach with the newest powerful genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, markers of the Y chromosome, and markers of mitochondrial DNA, we aim to construct a global tree of human languages and genes. A collaborative approach between linguists and biologists will ensure the selection of significant populations for language and gene sampling, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the relationships between linguistic and genetic diversity. This project has the potential to rise above existing limitations in available language classification methods, ultimately shedding new light on Darwin's prediction of an isomorphy between trees of languages and populations."
