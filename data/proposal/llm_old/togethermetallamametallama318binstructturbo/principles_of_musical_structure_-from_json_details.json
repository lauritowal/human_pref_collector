        "**Title:** Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to advance our understanding of human cognition, with a specific focus on complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. By integrating insights from music theory, computational modeling, and cognitive psychology, we will develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds the limitations of current approaches. Our theoretical strand will provide a comprehensive framework for harmonic structure and voice leading constraints, while our computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses using a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars. The experimental strand will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, including nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. This research will contribute significantly to our understanding of music cognition and the cognitive sciences, with potential implications for music education, music therapy, and the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of processing and generating music. The proposed project will yield a comprehensive and innovative framework for understanding musical structure and its cognitive underpinnings."
