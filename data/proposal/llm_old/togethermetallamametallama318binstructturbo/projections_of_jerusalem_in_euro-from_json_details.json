        "**Title: Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the phenomenon of Jerusalem's re-creation in Europe through monumental networks. Spanning hundreds of sites, this project aims to document and study the multimedia, interactive representations of Jerusalem, exploring their significance in the context of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. Our research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, encompassing field documentation, textual analysis, cross-referencing, and the grouping of monuments.\n\nWe anticipate that this project will yield new insights into the ways in which Jerusalem has been re-imagined and re-presented across Europe, shedding light on the complex relationships between icon, map, network, interactive multimedia, and space/place. Our research activities will be informed by collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences.\n\nThe project's long-term impact will be realized through a comparative study and conceptualization of Jerusalem's re-creations in Europe. Ultimately, this research will culminate in a comprehensive book, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex historical, cultural, and spiritual dynamics at play in the construction and representation of Jerusalem's monumental networks."
