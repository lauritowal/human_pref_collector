        "Title: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries: A Game-Theoretic Analysis\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance the theory of decentralized trade by systematically analyzing the impact of informational asymmetries and limited commitment on market efficiency in repeated transactions. Building on the limitations of existing mechanism design theory, which relies on strong commitment assumptions, this project will investigate the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms in contexts where parties have unequal information, such as professional investors and individuals in financial markets, and consumers' private information about willingness to pay.\n\nThrough a game-theoretic analysis, this research will explore remedies for enhanced efficiency and contribute to market institution design and regulation. By understanding the effects of informational asymmetries on market outcomes, this project will provide valuable insights for improving market efficiency and informing regulatory policies in various sectors, including repeated transactions in non-durable goods and services, and repeated transactions in durable but divisible goods. The outcome of this research will be a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing the challenges posed by informational asymmetries in decentralized markets."
