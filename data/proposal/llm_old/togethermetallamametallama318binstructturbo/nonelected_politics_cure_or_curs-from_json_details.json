        "**Title:** Non-elected politics. Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, \"Non-elected politics. Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\", aims to investigate the complex relationship between delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts, and the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. The project tackles the paradox of non-elected politics, where decision-making powers are transferred to non-elected individuals, contradicting the core tenet of representative democracy. Our central hypothesis posits that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining online survey experiments and panel surveys, we will examine the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy. A comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000 will provide a rich dataset for analysis. Our study will also explore European preferences for democratic function and reforms, shedding light on the societal implications of non-elected politics. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of non-elected politics on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe."
