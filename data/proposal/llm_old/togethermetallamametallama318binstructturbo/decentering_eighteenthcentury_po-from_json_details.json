        "**Title:** De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a radical reevaluation of eighteenth-century European political economy by shifting the focus from theoretical models to practical concerns. Rather than imposing modern perspectives on the past, we will explore how historical actors in the Swedish Empire navigated the complexities of growth, wealth, and welfare. By examining the discursive production sites of the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, we aim to uncover the lived experiences and policy-making processes that shaped the Swedish Empire's economic and social landscape.\n\nOur hypothesis is that activities in each site were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and enhancing the living conditions of the people. This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the early history of European political economy and its continued relevance in contemporary debates. Through a comparative analysis of the Swedish Empire with other cases, we will identify broader patterns and applicability of our findings, shedding new light on the evolution of political economy in the eighteenth century."
