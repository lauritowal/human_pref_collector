        "**Title:** Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to implement an innovative economic engineering approach to cooperation problems in modern markets and societies. Building on the pioneering work of Alvin Roth, our project aims to address critical challenges in cooperation, leveraging experimental methods and behavioral game theory to design more effective cooperation mechanisms. The project is structured into three work packages:\n\n1. Electronic reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in the digital world, addressing the flaws in current trust mechanisms on the Internet.\n2. Mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed, applicable to real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, to mitigate collective wastefulness and market stability threats.\n3. Market designs aligned with ethical considerations, drawing inspiration from successful applications such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights.\n\nExpected outcomes of this project include improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. By tackling cooperation problems head-on, our project will have far-reaching implications for the economy and society, making cooperation essential for prosperity."
