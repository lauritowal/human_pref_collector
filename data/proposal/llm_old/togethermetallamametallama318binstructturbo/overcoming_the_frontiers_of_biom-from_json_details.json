        "**Title:** Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics (BACKWARD)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, BACKWARD, aims to revolutionize the field of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation by developing cutting-edge palaeoproteomic workflows. Leveraging advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions, we will address long-standing questions in human phylogeny, particularly in African and Asian extinct hominids. By employing palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing, we will reconstruct evolutionary histories for species extinct millions of years ago, extending our understanding of human origins and adaptation.\n\nThis project will focus on two key targets: the phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia. The expected outcomes will have far-reaching applications, including the identification of processes driving human brain expansion and reorganization, as well as the species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Additionally, the developed technologies will have transformative impact in various industries, such as diagnostics in forensic medicine, the food industry, and the pharmaceutical industry. A strong collaborative effort among participating institutions will ensure the successful implementation of this innovative project, leaving a lasting legacy akin to the transformative impact of ancient DNA studies over the past two decades."
