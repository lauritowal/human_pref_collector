        "**Title:** From Warfare to Welfare: A Comparative Study of Combat Trauma Internalization and Institutionalization\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposed research project aims to develop a comparative framework for understanding the internalization and institutionalization of combat trauma in three nations: Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Through an interdisciplinary approach, combining ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, this study will shed light on the complex dynamics of combat trauma shaping and the conflicting values that arise within military and psychiatric institutions.\n\nBy examining how combat trauma is perceived and handled by different institutions and professionals, this project seeks to identify key problems in veteran care, influence policy and healthcare practices, and advance studies in biopolitics and medicalization. The expected outcomes of this research will be significant for both veterans and clinicians, contributing to a better understanding of the impact of war-related suffering on individuals and society.\n\nThis study is particularly relevant in today's era of ongoing conflicts and the growing recognition of the need for comprehensive care for military personnel and veterans. By comparing the experiences of combat trauma in three different nations, this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between military, psychiatric, and social institutions, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective and compassionate care for those affected by war."
