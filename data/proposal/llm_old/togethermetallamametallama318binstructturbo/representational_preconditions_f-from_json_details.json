        "**Title:** Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the early representational preconditions and functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. Contrary to standard theories, which propose that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late-developing, our novel theoretical approach posits that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that infants as young as 7 months of age possess mechanisms for automatic computation of others' beliefs. Building on our own research findings, this project seeks to explore the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities. Our research goals include charting the developmental unfolding of these abilities and investigating the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions.\n\nBy exploring the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human collaboration and social learning. Our research will shed new light on the origins of social cognition and inform the development of novel interventions for promoting social skills in infants and young children."
