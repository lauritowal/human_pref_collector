        "**Title:** Classical Influences and Irish Culture\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project proposes a comprehensive investigation of the underexplored cultural engagement between ancient Greece and Rome and Ireland. Our hypothesis is that Ireland's unique history and cultural context have led to a distinct and underappreciated interaction with classical learning, which has had a lasting impact on Irish literature, history, and society. This project will focus on nine key themes, including language, land, and the influence of classical mythology on Irish literature. By employing a multi-thematic and heuristic framework, we will engage in dialogue between various disciplines, including classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English and Irish-language literature, and material culture studies. This research aims to shed new light on the politics and history of Ireland, particularly in relation to the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state and the ongoing legacy of violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. Our expected outcomes include the identification of new avenues for investigation and a deeper understanding of the enduring influence of classical culture on Irish literary, social, and political discourse."
