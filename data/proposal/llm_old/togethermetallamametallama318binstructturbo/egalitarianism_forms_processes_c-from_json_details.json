        "**Title:** Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive library-based global comparative study and field ethnographic studies to investigate the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values. A decentering orientation heterogeneity approach will be employed to understand the complexities of egalitarian practices and processes. The research goals include integrating library and field studies, developing a comparative method, and examining the forms and practices of egalitarianism as cultural values. Key perennial questions, such as the role of the state, religion, forms of economic distribution, and matters of scale, will be addressed.\n\nThis project aims to develop a comparative method that is open to varieties in conceptions and imagination, responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances, and applicable to diverse research sites, including Europe and elsewhere. By exploring the complexities and challenges of egalitarian practices and processes, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of egalitarianism as a cultural phenomenon and provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners."
