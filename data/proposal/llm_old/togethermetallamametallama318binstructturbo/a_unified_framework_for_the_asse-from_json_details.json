        "**Title:** A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nCognitive models have become increasingly influential in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology, but their widespread adoption is hindered by the proliferation of disparate ideas and techniques. This project aims to develop a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models, leveraging Bayesian inference foundations to provide a coherent framework for evaluating and utilizing these models.\n\nOur proposed approach involves the assessment of absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, exploration of efficient algorithms for parameter estimation, and application to data from popular experimental designs. We will focus on three key models: drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. Our enhancements will include the construction of plausible parameter priors, development of diagnostic experiments, and assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs.\n\nThe outcome of this project will be the establishment of a new standard for cognitive modeling, with techniques incorporated into JASP and new methodology available for students, researchers, and practitioners. By providing a unified framework for the assessment and application of cognitive models, this project will facilitate more effective and efficient research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology."
