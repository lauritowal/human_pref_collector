        "**Title:** Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the Elderly to Places Where Care is More Affordable\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multi-sited anthropological study examining the transnationalization of care and care relocation in Europe. Dubbed \"grandmother deportation\" or \"geriatric colonialism,\" the phenomenon of relocating elderly individuals from more affluent Western European countries to Eastern European nations with lower care costs is a growing trend. Our project aims to investigate the marketization of care, the entanglement of welfare states and entitlements across borders, and the implications of this trend on the provision and management of elderly care.\n\nThrough in-depth ethnographic studies and examinations of care entrepreneurs, state insurances, and the histories of places, we will explore the experiences of elderly individuals from Austria and Germany, who are relocated to care homes in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where costs are approximately one-third of those in their home countries. Our research will shed light on the complex interplay between labour migration, real estate investment, state insurances, and regional migration, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the transnational entanglements of welfare states in Europe. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable insights into the future of elderly care in an increasingly interconnected Europe."
