        "**Title:** Between Canon and Coincidence: Using Data-Driven Approaches to Understand Art Worlds\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, \"BECACO,\" aims to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections by adopting a large-scale, data-driven approach. Building upon the concept of \"Art World Patterns\" introduced by Howard Becker in 2008, this study will investigate the socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material from Indigenous Latin America to European museums. By employing quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data from 12 museums in 9 countries, this project seeks to develop new models for provenance research and advance conceptual and methodological frameworks. The study will focus on the period from 1850 to 2000 and explore the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe. The outcome of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics involved in the creation, circulation, and display of cultural artifacts, ultimately enriching our comprehension of art worlds and their global implications."
