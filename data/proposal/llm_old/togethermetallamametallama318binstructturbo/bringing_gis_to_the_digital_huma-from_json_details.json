        "**Grant Proposal: Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities,\" aims to develop novel methodologies for analyzing unstructured texts within a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment. Led by an experienced Principal Investigator with expertise in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), this project seeks to redefine the boundaries of the humanities by leveraging the power of spatial analysis.\n\nThrough a combination of GIS and Corpus Linguistics, this project will investigate the English Lake District during the Romantic era and mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England and Wales. By applying spatial analysis to textual sources, we will broaden our understanding of the humanities and shed new light on the complexities of human experience.\n\nThis project will have a major impact within the humanities and beyond, with applications in ancient manuscripts, modern newspapers, and e-resources. We propose to disseminate our findings through short courses, expert meetings, and a conference, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing across disciplines."
