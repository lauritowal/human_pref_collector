        "**Title:** Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire: A bio-archaeological project on resilience and collapse in early Christian development of the Negev Desert\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal supports an innovative, interdisciplinary bio-archaeological project aimed at understanding the long-term sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments. Focusing on the 4th-7th century AD Byzantine early Christian urban centers in the Negev Desert, our research explores contexts of collapse and resilience in a society characterized by socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity. We will employ a multifaceted approach, incorporating archaeology of households and landscapes, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, geological analysis, chronometric techniques, and artifact analysis. Our research questions examine social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation due to climatic or anthropogenic causes, and the impact of plague. By integrating diverse data sources, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development, informing generalizations and addressing the pressing issue of societal vulnerability in marginal regions."
