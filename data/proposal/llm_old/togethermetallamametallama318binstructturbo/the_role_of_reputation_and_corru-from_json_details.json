        "**Title:** The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement: A Multi-Sectoral Investigation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal seeks funding to investigate the complex interplay between reputation and corruption in procurement practices across various sectors, including defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The proposed project aims to design and implement empirical studies that will advance our understanding of the factors that influence procurement outcomes and the effectiveness of mechanisms to prevent corruption and ensure contractor compliance.\n\nThree key components comprise this project. The first component will examine the role of reputation in contract procurement, exploring how vendor rating systems impact contractor performance, procurement costs, corruption concerns, and new bidder entry. The second component will investigate corruption in public procurement, analyzing the extent of criminal networks, the effectiveness of awarding rules againstlrt corruption, and corruption detection tests. The third component will focus on healthcare procurement regulations, conducting descriptive analyses of EU practices, evaluating the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, and assessing the effects on patients' welfare.\n\nThis research has the potential to inform policy and practice in procurement, ultimately promoting social welfare and reducing waste."
