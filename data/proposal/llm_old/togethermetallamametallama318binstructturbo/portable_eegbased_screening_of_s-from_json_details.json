        "**Title:** Portable EEG-based Screening of Social Predispositions in Newborns: A Novel Approach to Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a portable, wireless EEG-based device for newborns to screen for social predispositions, particularly in the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our goals include designing a user-friendly device that requires less than 2 minutes of the newborn's visual attention, developing an early, objective EEG-based biomarker, and enabling automatic on-line extraction of face processing indices. The proposed device will employ innovative oscillatory visual presentation and dry electrodes, ensuring a non-invasive and comfortable experience for newborns.\n\nThe proposed technology has the potential to bridge the current market gap by providing the first fully portable EEG system for newborns. This innovation will facilitate early behavioral intervention for ASD, enabling large-scale screening protocols. The use cases of this technology extend beyond ASD detection, including home testing and research on neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions. This project has the potential to revolutionize the early detection and diagnosis of ASD, ultimately improving the quality of life for affected individuals."
