        "**Title:** Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the drivers of growth in bank lending and their potential contribution to financial crises. Despite a strong consensus on the need for tighter macroprudential regulation, the empirical evidence on the individual factors underlying banking crises is still lacking. This project seeks to identify and estimate the impact of each factor on loan growth, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios.\n\nUtilizing exceptional micro-level datasets and an appropriate methodology, this project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the individual ingredients' impact on credit growth and assess their potential combinations. The proposed research will ensure external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies, and provide a theoretical framework when necessary. By shedding light on the complex relationships between these factors, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the global banking system and inform more effective macroprudential policies."
