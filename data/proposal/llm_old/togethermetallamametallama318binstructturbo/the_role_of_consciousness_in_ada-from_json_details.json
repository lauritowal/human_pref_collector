        "**Title:** The Role of Consciousness in Adaptive Behavior: A Combined Empirical, Computational, and Robot-Based Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC), aims to elucidate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior. By integrating empirical, computational, and robot-based approaches, this research seeks to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action, identify neuronal principles of consciousness, and construct a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture. The key hypothesis is that a shift to intentional agent-dominated worlds requires different control architectures, incorporating parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation, along with a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene.\n\nThis project will result in a framework advancing beyond the state of the art, system-level models of conscious architecture, computational studies of the neuronal substrate, and empirical validation through humanoid robots and stroke patients. The outcomes will not only address questions on the function and genesis of consciousness but also advance our understanding of the mind and brain, providing new neurorehabilitation technologies and contributing to a new generation of robots with advanced social competence."
