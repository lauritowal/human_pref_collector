        "**Title:** Forced Migration and Development: Understanding Economic Consequences in Developing Countries\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, \"Forced Migration and Development\" (FORCEDMIGDEV), aims to investigate the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries. The project focuses on two critical aspects: (1) the impact of refugee inflows on host economies, and (2) the effects of climate-related internal displacement on regional development. The proposed research involves a mixed-methods approach, combining reduced-form and structural methods to analyze the distributional effects of refugee shocks and climate-related displacement.\n\nKey objectives include developing a structural model to estimate the economic consequences of refugee inflows, investigating the welfare effects across regions, and assessing the effects of legal status for refugees. In addition, the project will apply reduced-form and structural methods to analyze the effects of climate-related internal displacement in Brazil, and develop a quantitative spatial model to assess long-run effects. The findings of this research will provide policymakers and development practitioners with valuable insights into the economic consequences of forced migration, ultimately informing strategies to mitigate the negative impacts and foster more effective development outcomes in the face of forced migration crises."
