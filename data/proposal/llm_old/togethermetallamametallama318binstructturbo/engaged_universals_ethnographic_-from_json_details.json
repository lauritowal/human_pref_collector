        "**Title:** Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of 'Universal Health Coverage' and the Public Good in Africa\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis anthropological research project, \"Engaged Universals,\" seeks to critically examine the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and its implementation in Africa. By focusing on three countries, we aim to uncover the complex dynamics surrounding UHC, including the contested field of public health, partial state pursuit, and conflicting interests. Through a mixed-methods ethnographic approach, involving multi-sited and multi-level research, we will engage with actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels to understand the relationships between states and citizens, formal systems of social protection, and informal social networks supporting health.\n\nOur research will shed light on the historical issues that have shaped the current state of UHC in Africa, including structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, privatization, and the neglect of national healthcare systems. By exploring how UHC is interpreted and implemented, we aim to contribute new research directions and provide knowledge of relevance beyond Africa. This project will provide insights into the complexities of achieving UHC, its impact on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions, ultimately informing policy and practice in Africa and beyond."
