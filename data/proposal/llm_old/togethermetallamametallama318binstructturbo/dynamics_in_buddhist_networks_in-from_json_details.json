        "**Title:** Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish a novel framework for understanding the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. By reconstructing the trans-regional and trans-cultural Buddhist networks spanning the 6th to 14th centuries, this project aims to contribute significantly to the field of Comparative Religious Studies. Our research will delve into the complex relationships between various cultures, including Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan, to shed light on the processes of Buddhist localisations in Eastern Central Asia.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, integrating philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies, this project will provide a unique perspective on the dynamics of religious exchange as a dynamic network in spatial and temporal aspects. By exploring the intersection of cultural encounter, religious transfer, and Buddhist localisations, this research will offer a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of Buddhism in Eastern Central Asia, ultimately enriching our knowledge of the region's cultural and religious heritage."
