        "**Title:** Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability (RICA)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability (RICA), aims to fundamentally re-conceptualize the relationships between regulatory independence, credibility, accountability, and autonomy in the regulatory state. Building on the insights from the political science literature on reputation, RICA seeks to address the pressing challenges of non-majoritarianism, devaluation of the political process, and the growing disconnect between accountability and autonomy.\n\nThrough a multi-module approach, this project will investigate the impact of agency insulation on credibility, develop a new theory on accountability and its relationship with reputation, and explore the implications of these findings for regulatory policy-making. By challenging established wisdom and proposing innovative theoretical frameworks, RICA will provide critical insights into the critical components of the regulatory state, ultimately informing more effective and accountable regulatory governance."
