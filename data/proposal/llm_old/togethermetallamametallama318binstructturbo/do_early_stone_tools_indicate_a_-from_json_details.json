        "**STONECULT: Unveiling the Origins of Cumulative Culture**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe emergence of culture in the human lineage is a pivotal event that enabled our species to adapt, innovate, and thrive on the planet. However, the timing and nature of this cultural revolution remain poorly understood. The \"STONECULT\" project aims to shed light on this fundamental question by investigating the earliest manifestations of culture in the form of stone tools. Our research question is: When did forms of culture first arise in our lineage?\n\nThis project proposes a novel approach, grounded in the \"latent solutions\" model, which posits that early hominin technology was driven by problem-solving mechanisms rather than high-fidelity copying of modern human cultural practices. We will test this hypothesis through a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, leveraging comparative models from modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches.\n\nOur objectives are twofold: (1) to test whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions, and (2) to inform our understanding of human culture evolution. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it has the potential to transform our understanding of human culture evolution and inform fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. By exploring the origins of cumulative culture, we will gain insights into the evolution of human innovation, adaptation, and societal complexity."
