        "**Title:** The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the evolutionary origins of friendship through a cross-species comparison and experimental approach. By examining the social behaviors of nonhuman primates, such as macaques, we will gain a deeper understanding of the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species. Our research will also establish whether having information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill, and test whether social isolation is the result of competitive exclusion.\n\nThe proposed project has significant implications for human health and well-being, as social isolation has been linked to a range of negative outcomes, including heart disease. By understanding the evolutionary perspective of friendship, this research will inform public health strategies and political policies aimed at promoting social connections and mitigating the effects of social isolation.\n\nThrough a combination of data collection from existing cross-species datasets and social experiments, this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary origins of friendship and its implications for human specializations. The proposed research will contribute to a deeper understanding of what it means to be human and inform strategies for promoting healthy social relationships."
