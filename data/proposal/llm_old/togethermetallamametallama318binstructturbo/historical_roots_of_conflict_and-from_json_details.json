        "**Title:** Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to investigate the historical roots of conflict and development by examining the effect of past events on contemporary economic and social outcomes. We propose a two-part study that leverages unique datasets to analyze the impact of historical factors on conflict and development.\n\n**Part 1:** Using administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America (1492-1599), we will explore the relationship between institutions, human capital, and economic development in the early stages of colonization. Our analysis will focus on the interaction between human capital and institutions, providing insights into the institutional variation during the initial times of colonization.\n\n**Part 2:** By constructing a dataset using archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts, we will investigate the long-run dynamics of conflict and its influence on current conflict. Our analysis will span various regions, allowing us to identify patterns and relationships that may not be apparent in local contexts.\n\nThis study will contribute to our understanding of the complex relationships between history, conflict, and development, shedding light on the historical roots of contemporary social and economic outcomes. The findings of this research will have significant implications for policymakers and scholars interested in understanding the long-term consequences of historical events."
