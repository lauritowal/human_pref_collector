        "**Title:** Insomnia's Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the association between insomnia and clinically significant depression symptoms in the elderly population. Despite its high prevalence (up to 40%) in this demographic, insomnia remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, contributing to the moderate effectiveness of depression treatment (20% detection rate). Our study seeks to address this knowledge gap by developing an interdisciplinary strategy that combines multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging to identify insomnia subtypes and elucidate their link to depression risk (13%). By early identifying at-risk individuals and quantifying the underlying mechanisms, our project aims to optimize internet-supported home-applicable interventions to prevent sleep-related depression in the elderly. We propose to achieve the following outcomes: 1) subtype profiling, 2) mechanism profiling, and 3) intervention optimization. This innovative approach has the potential to improve mental health outcomes and quality of life for an aging population."
