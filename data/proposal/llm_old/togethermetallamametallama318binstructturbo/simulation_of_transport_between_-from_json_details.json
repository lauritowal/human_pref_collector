        "**Title:** Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube (STRADA) project aims to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system to study the ancient Roman transport network between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube River. This innovative project will reconstruct the land and water routes, experimentally determine the performance of various means of transport under changing environmental conditions, and analyze the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system.\n\nUtilizing modular design for sustainable use and future extension, the STRADA system will feature local fine granular topography, historical weather data, different means of transport with varying loads, actor fatigue, and necessary rests and loading times. The project will focus on the Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscape, providing a comprehensive understanding of the Roman Empire's economic cohesion.\n\nBy introducing dynamic simulations into historical research, STRADA seeks to enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, ultimately shedding new light on the intricacies of ancient Roman transport."
