        "Title: Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949\n\nThis project undertakes a comprehensive survey of the cultural landscape in the British and American zones of Occupied Germany between 1945 and 1949. Combining literature and film history, critical analysis, and cultural history, this multidisciplinary study investigates the cross-fertilization of Anglo-American and German literature and film, and provides a new interpretative framework for postwar culture. The project's findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany and the relationship between postwar culture and the Cold War."
