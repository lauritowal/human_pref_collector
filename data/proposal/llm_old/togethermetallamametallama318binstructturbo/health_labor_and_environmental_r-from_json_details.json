        "**Title:** Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project aims to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in post-industrial Europe. The project focuses on the economic, labor, and health implications of environmental regulation in the context of global climate change and increasing demand for environmental quality. Specifically, Part I of the project examines the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, while Part II investigates the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration.\n\nThis research contributes new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, an interdisciplinary approach linking causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models, and incorporation of subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates. The project's findings are expected to have a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus, with implications for climate policy and air quality management. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between environmental regulation, labor, health, and the economy, this research aims to inform policy decisions that balance economic growth with environmental protection and human well-being."
