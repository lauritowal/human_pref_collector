        "**Title:** Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"LostInZoom,\" aims to revolutionize the design of multi-scale interactive maps for crisis management and other critical applications. Our research objective is to develop new cartographic zooming paradigms based on multi-scale visual landmarks that serve as anchors during zooming interactions. To achieve this, we will (1) identify the key visual landmarks that facilitate orientation and navigation in multi-scale maps, (2) design novel cartographic generalization techniques to ensure smooth transitions between scales, and (3) create intuitive zooming interactions centered around these identified landmarks.\n\nOur research is motivated by the widespread adoption of multi-scale interactive maps in crisis management and the resultant usability issues. Current guidelines for map design are inadequate for multi-scale maps, leading to user disorientation and decreased efficiency. By addressing these challenges, the LostInZoom project will contribute significantly to the development of more effective and user-friendly multi-scale maps, ultimately enhancing crisis response and management capabilities."
