        "**Title:** FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe rise of disinformation has become a pressing concern, with search engines often playing a significant role in its dissemination. This project aims to fill the existing knowledge gap by investigating how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation. Our goal is to develop an innovative auditing system that enables democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time, thereby breaching information bubbles and promoting a more informed public discourse.\n\nThe proposed system will feature a privacy-protecting web-crawler and an auditing tool for search engines that does not require real user data. By shifting from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting, we will create a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of online behavior. The anticipated outcomes of this project include increased public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread and the equipage of organizations with a disinformation detection and monitoring tool. This research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field and inform the development of more effective strategies to combat disinformation."
