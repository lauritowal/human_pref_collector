        "**Title:** Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators: A Novel Software Toolbox for Improved Economic Decision Making\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, submitted to the European Research Council (ERC), aims to develop a cutting-edge software toolbox for forecasting and monitoring key economic indicators. Leveraging the ERC's Proof of Concept funding, we will build upon our previous research experience in Change-Point Tests (ERC-2007-StG) to create a user-friendly, real-time monitoring system that incorporates novel model families and predictive breakdown tests. Our toolbox will enable governments, Central Banks, and firms to make more informed decisions, driving prudent economic policy, economic growth, and improved economic and social welfare. Key features of the proposed software include real-time monitoring, high-frequency information use, and predictive breakdown tests. Initial collaborations with a forecasting agency and a Central Bank have already established a solid foundation for the project. The development of this innovative software will be guided by the following aspects: user-friendly design, three-dimensional graphical representation, and accessibility to decision makers. This project has the potential to significantly impact economic decision making, making it a valuable addition to the ERC's portfolio."
