        "**Title: Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" seeks to advance our understanding of the relationship between organized labour and policy innovation in promoting work-life balance in Europe. Focusing on social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time, this mixed-methods research project will investigate the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections, with a particular emphasis on the role of trade unions in promoting policy change.\n\nThe project aims to examine the intersection of gender, caregiving, and union membership, with a focus on the experiences of women in caregiving roles. Through quantitative analysis of rich democracies from 1965 onwards and qualitative analysis of case studies in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, this research will shed light on the policy focus areas of child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits.\n\nBy developing longitudinal, comparative data on care leave provisions and investigating the mechanisms of union influence, this project seeks to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of sustainable work policies and promote organized labour's role as a partner in policy innovation."
