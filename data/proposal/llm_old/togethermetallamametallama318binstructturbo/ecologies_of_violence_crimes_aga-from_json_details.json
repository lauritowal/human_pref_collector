        "**Title:** Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Ecologies of Violence,\" aims to develop a novel ecological model for understanding the representation and impact of violence against the natural world in cultural expressions. Through a comparative study and transnational analysis, we will investigate how cultural artifacts, including literature, film, and art, represent ecoviolence, its intersections with colonialism and genocide, and the cultural memory that surrounds these issues. Our project will also explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to convey the urgency of environmental crises and promote critical self-reflection. By integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will reorient the field to consider the complex relationships between humans, non-human entities, and the environment. Ultimately, our project will produce a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture, a best practices guide for pedagogy, and a framework for critical literacies about ecoviolence. The outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural and ecological dimensions of violence, with implications for environmental policy, education, and cultural sustainability."
