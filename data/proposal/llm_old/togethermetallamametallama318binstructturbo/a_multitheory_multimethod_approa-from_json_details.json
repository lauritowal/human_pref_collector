        "Title: A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe proposed project aims to address the pressing global issue of radicalization leading to violence by developing a comprehensive, multi-theory, and multi-method approach. This research initiative is situated within the United Nations' Decade of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals (2020-2030) and aligns with the priority of fighting violent extremism. The project seeks to overcome existing shortcomings in theoretical, empirical, and methodological frameworks by developing innovative tools and strategies for preventing and reducing radicalization.\n\nThe proposed work will be conducted across 10 nations, including Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan. Four key work packages will be implemented: (1) developing a multi-theory model for radicalization and deradicalization; (2) creating an innovative methodology for data collection; (3) examining mechanisms of radicalization inside and outside prisons through interviews and experiments; and (4) developing evidence-based programs for preventing radicalization in prisons and conducting deradicalization.\n\nThis project will make significant contributions to scientific understanding by collecting unique empirical data from violent extremist offenders worldwide and providing novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism. The findings will inform the development of effective policies and interventions to prevent and reduce radicalization leading to violence."
