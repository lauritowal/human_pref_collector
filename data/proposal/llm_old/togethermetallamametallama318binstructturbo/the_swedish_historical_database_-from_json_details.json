        "**Title:** The Swedish Historical Database Project: Unlocking Insights into Sweden's Economic and Social Development\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to develop a comprehensive historical database for Sweden's administrative districts from 1749 to 1952. The database will contain approximately 500,000 observations per variable, covering a range of topics including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social statistics, agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments. This unique resource will provide a local-level perspective on Sweden's economic and social development, allowing researchers to explore structural transformation, economic growth, and economic development in unprecedented detail.\n\nWith its comprehensive coverage of 2,500 administrative districts, this database has significant potential for empirical research, leveraging instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation strategies. Our team has already submitted a related paper to Econometrica (Round 2, Revise and Resubmit) and plans to investigate topics such as economic development and economic growth in future research projects. By making this database publicly available, we aim to facilitate new insights into Sweden's historical development and promote international collaboration in economic and social research."
