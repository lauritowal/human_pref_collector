        "**Title:** The Silence of States in International Law\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project, \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" which aims to shed light on the understudied concept of State silence in international law. Through an in-depth analysis of State practice, international jurisprudence, and empirical studies of government officials and international judges, this project will provide a taxonomy of the 'silences' of States, examine the legal effects of different silences, and critically assess whether a change in the law is necessary.\n\nThe proposed research investigates three key aspects: the binding nature of State silence, the role of State inaction in their responsibility, and the effect of inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings. This project will contribute to the development of international law by providing a nuanced understanding of State silence and its implications for States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals.\n\nBy advancing knowledge in this area, this project aims to inform policy and decision-making in international law and promote a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between States and international law."
