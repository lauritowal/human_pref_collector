        "**Title:** Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in post-socialist city contexts across Europe. The project focuses on Eastern and Central Europe, where millions of households are affected by energy vulnerability, characterized by energy price increases, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, and income differentials. Building on the energy vulnerability framework, this comparative study will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the relationships between energy poverty, economic restructuring, and urban transitions in four case study locations: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje.\n\nThe project aims to advance our conceptual understanding of energy poverty by addressing current limitations related to income and energy efficiency. Expected outcomes include the improvement of technical and institutional frameworks, the provision of affordable energy services, and enhanced climate change mitigation. By shedding light on the multifaceted nature of energy poverty, this research will inform policies and interventions to address the pressing energy challenges facing urban communities in Europe."
