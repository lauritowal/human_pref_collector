        "**Title:** Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation: A Unified Science Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed PRINCIPLES project aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated understanding of human cooperation in the face of global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. Current models of cooperation are limited by their narrow focus on individual aspects, often neglecting the complexity of real-world problems. This project seeks to bridge the gap by combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to develop a unified science of human cooperation.\n\nAt the heart of PRINCIPLES lies the concept of rule following, which is experimentally tested through incentivised experiments in representative samples. The project's objectives include developing a comprehensive model of cooperation, investigating behavioural links between key principles, and analysing models of social dilemmas. The outcomes of PRINCIPLES will equip researchers and policy makers across disciplines with the necessary tools and data to tackle cooperation problems, ultimately informing strategies to address pressing global challenges."
