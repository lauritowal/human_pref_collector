        "**Title:** Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, Blockchain4Biodiversity, aims to develop and test a blockchain-based platform, ReSeed, to promote the conservation and sustainable use of indigenous seeds (ISK) among small farmers' communities. The current system lacks tracking and incentives for ISK cultivation and conservation, hindering global food security and sustainable agriculture. ReSeed will address this gap by providing an equitable and transparent platform for the transfer of ISK, incentivizing honest reporting of downstream research, and promoting in situ conservation and innovation with agrobiodiversity.\n\nBuilding on 12 years of previous research, this project will integrate blockchain technology with international regulatory frameworks, requiring minimal legal amendments. The governance model will ensure adherence to ethics guidelines, ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits among stakeholders. The project's expected outcomes include in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, value addition to farmers' ISK, and economic and environmental benefits to small farmers. By addressing the economic incentives for ISK cultivation and conservation, ReSeed has the potential to significantly contribute to global food security and sustainable agriculture."
