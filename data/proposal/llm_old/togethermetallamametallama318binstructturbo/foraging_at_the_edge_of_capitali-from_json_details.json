        "**Title:** Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism: A Political Ecology of Resource Extraction in the Anthropocene\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy in the Anthropocene era, marked by the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Building on the increased global relevance of foraging since the 2008 financial crisis, this project will explore how foraging practices engage with and resist the forces of capitalism. Through an interdisciplinary approach grounded in anthropology, our team of five international researchers will investigate the complex relationships between humans, the environment, and economic systems in various foraging contexts, including yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomadism in the US.\n\nThis project will produce a range of outputs, including two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a documentary film, and an exhibition. By examining the intersections of foraging, capitalism, and the environment, our research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the Anthropocene and its implications for human societies and the natural world. The proposed research will be based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, and will involve close collaboration with community stakeholders and experts in the field."
