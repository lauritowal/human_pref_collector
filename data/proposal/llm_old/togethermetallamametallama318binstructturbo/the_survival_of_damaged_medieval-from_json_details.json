        "**Title:** The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, POLYCHROME, focuses on understanding the survival of damaged medieval polychromed heritage in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. The project aims to analyze the causes of damage to approximately 150 painted, gilded, and wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces. We hypothesize that the damage is linked to iconoclastic acts following the break with the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.\n\nUsing technologies from natural sciences, this multidisciplinary study will provide an analytical overview of the objects, collect material data, and map restorations and repairs. The project aims to establish foundations for future studies and debate about heritage values and future care. Expected outcomes include understanding the preserving effects of Lutheranism and influencing training priorities for the conservation of Nordic cultural heritage.\n\nThis research will fill a significant gap in the understanding of the risk to cultural heritage and provide essential information for the conservation and preservation of Nordic polychromed heritage."
