        "**Title:** Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society: Exploring Human-Environment Interaction in the Ancient Near East\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, CLaSS (Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society), seeks to investigate the factors that contribute to the differential persistence of societies under changing climates in the Ancient Near East. Focusing on the Fertile Crescent (c. 8000-2000 BP), a region of approximately 600,000 kmÂ², our project employs a hybrid research approach, integrating archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data with General Circulation Models and advanced data science techniques. Our objectives are to: (1) reconstruct population densities, distribution, and subsistence practices, and (2) analyze landscape management strategies in response to abrupt and longer-term climate changes. By examining the resilience of societies under varying environmental conditions, CLaSS will provide insights into sustainability and offer a unique perspective on the complex relationships between human societies and their environments. This research has the potential to inform modern climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of human-environment interaction."
