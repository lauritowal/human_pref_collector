        "**Title:** Our Mythical Childhood: The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children's and Young Adults' Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, led by an international team of scholars, aims to develop a pioneering approach to the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' culture. By applying regional perspectives without pejorative implications, the project will provide a comparative study of reception models across various regions, including non-traditional ones for the Graeco-Roman tradition. Our research will explore how Classical Antiquity is reshaped in response to regional and global challenges, offering insights into identity formation and initiation into adulthood.\n\nThe project will address the limitations of current research, which has selectively focused on Western culture, by incorporating diverse regional perspectives. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations and their impact on scholarship, education, and culture. The deliverables will include a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. By contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange, this project has the potential to significantly impact the field of Classical studies and its applications in education and culture."
