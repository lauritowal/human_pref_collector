        "**Title:** Social Politics in European Borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposed research project aims to refract the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by examining the social politics of four distinct borderland regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. Spanning nearly a century (1870s-1990s), the study will employ a comparative and transnational framework to analyze the interactions between local, public, and private actors in constructing welfare structures. By focusing on the contributions of local actors, the co-construction of welfare, and the intersection of national and non-national identity/solidarity, this research will shed new light on the complex dynamics of social provision.\n\nThe study's anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, as well as insights into the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. The research's relevance extends beyond historical analysis, as it informs contemporary debates on welfare reform and addresses pressing social rights issues in Europe. By exploring the roles of local actors in shaping welfare systems, this project seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of social politics in modern Europe."
