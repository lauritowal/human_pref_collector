        "**Title:** From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to elucidate the role of gamma waves in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, particularly within the context of predictive coding in the visual cortex. We propose to investigate the encoding functions of gamma waves and their part in predictive coding, exploring their relationship with top-down predictions, bottom-up prediction errors, learning, and updating priors. The project will develop a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, using a combination of techniques, including deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Subjects will include both marmosets and humans, with variables tested including predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns. The anticipated outcome is evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. This project has the potential to provide significant insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive disorders, such as neurological and psychiatric disorders, and to shed light on the neural basis of experience-dependent perceptual learning."
