        "**Title:** The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents a cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research project that aims to shed new light on the mysterious Bantu Expansion, a pivotal event in human history that took place in Late Holocene Central Africa. Our research team, comprising archaeologists, archaeobotanists, and historical linguists from multiple institutions, will employ a holistic approach to investigate the timing, location, and characteristics of the first Bantu-speaking village communities in Central Africa.\n\nThrough a combination of fieldwork, data analysis, and phylogenetic modeling, we will reconstruct the subsistence patterns, land use practices, and habitat of these early farming communities, as well as their interactions with hunter-gatherers. Our research will also explore the impact of climate change on the spread of Bantu languages and the development of early farming practices.\n\nThis project will address several open questions in the field, including the timing and location of the earliest Bantu-speaking villages, their archaeological signature, and their relationship with the surrounding environment. The results of this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa."
