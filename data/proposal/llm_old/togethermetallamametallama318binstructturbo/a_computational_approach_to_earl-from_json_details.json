        "**Title:** A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nLanguage acquisition in infants is a complex and dynamic process that has been studied extensively through behavioral and neurological methods. However, the early stages of language development remain poorly understood due to the limited availability of suitable data and the difficulty of simulating infant language acquisition in a controlled environment. This grant proposal aims to address this knowledge gap by developing and testing a computational model of early language bootstrapping in infants.\n\nOur proposed project involves the construction of a simulation model that mimics the early language acquisition process, which is then tested on speech databases and through behavioral and neurological studies of infants. We will focus on three key subprojects: (1) defining coding features for speech, (2) word segmentation in raw speech, and (3) predictive modeling of coarticulation in auditory space. The model will be iteratively integrated with approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules, and its performance will be assessed on both adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute to the development of a computational framework for understanding early language acquisition in infants, and has the potential to shed new light on the cognitive and neurological mechanisms underlying this complex process. By combining machine learning, automatic speech recognition, and behavioral and neurological studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive and accurate simulation of early language bootstrapping in infants."
