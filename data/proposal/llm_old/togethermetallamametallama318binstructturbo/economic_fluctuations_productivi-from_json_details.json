        "**Title:** Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal seeks to develop a unified Keynesian growth framework that integrates business cycles and growth in a comprehensive theory. Our project aims to investigate the complex relationships between economic fluctuations, productivity growth, and stabilization policies through a novel Keynesian growth model with endogenous growth features (Part I). We will extend this framework to an open economy setting to examine the interplay between monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth (Part II). Empirical testing of the model will be conducted to assess the responsiveness of productivity growth to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions (Part III). Case studies will include the Euro inception effects on recipient countries and empirical estimations of productivity growth responses in the United States and a panel of advanced economies. This research will provide critical insights into the drivers of productivity growth and inform evidence-based stabilization policies to mitigate the effects of economic downturns. By advancing our understanding of the complex interactions between economic fluctuations and growth, this project will contribute to a more effective and sustainable economic policy framework."
