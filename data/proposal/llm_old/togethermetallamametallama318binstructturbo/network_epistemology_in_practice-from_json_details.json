        "**Title:** Network Epistemology in Practice: Uncovering Collective Knowledge Generation at CERN\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the epistemological dynamics of large-scale scientific collaborations through a case study of particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). Leveraging digital humanities tools and computational methods, we aim to reconstruct internal communication and characterize collective research processes through analysis of born-digital documents, including e-mails and internal wiki pages.\n\nBy applying theoretical models of network epistemology to this real-world setting, we will gain a deeper understanding of knowledge generation and validation in complex scientific collaborations. Our objectives include developing historiographic guidelines for future studies, contributing to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, and adapting theoretical models to accommodate the unique challenges of network epistemology.\n\nThis project addresses the pressing need to develop practical strategies for best practices in the history and philosophy of science, particularly when working with born-digital sources. Our expected contributions will include historiographic guidelines and practical strategies for historians and philosophers of science, as well as methodological innovations in the application of digital tools and computational methods."
