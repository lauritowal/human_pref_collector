        "**Title:** MetCogCon: Investigating the Metacognition of Concepts\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled MetCogCon, aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the metacognitive processes involved in concept use. Concepts, such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, play a crucial role in human cognitive capabilities, serving as tools for thought, reasoning, and induction. However, the metacognitive aspects of concept use remain poorly understood.\n\nThe MetCogCon project will address this knowledge gap by combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science with psychological model-building and experimental investigation. By examining the thoughts and feelings that accompany concept use, we aim to clarify the influence of metacognition on decision-making, concept selection, and cognitive control.\n\nThe proposed research has significant potential impacts, including improved understanding of cognitive control and address of philosophical problems. The project's expected outcomes include enhanced understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind, informing reasoning policies in everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and determining the reliability of heuristics in concept selection.\n\nThis grant will provide essential support for the MetCogCon project, enabling the investigation of metacognition of concepts and contributing to a deeper understanding of human cognitive processes."
