        "**Title:** Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition: Informing Targeted Citizenship Policies for Settlement Success\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project investigates the timing and impact of citizenship on migrant integration, with a focus on how policy variations influence legal status transitions and integration outcomes. We aim to model migrants' legal status transitions as life course events, analyzing the relevance of citizenship for various dimensions of integration, including work and income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment. Our study will employ longitudinal and survey-based micro-data from 8 European and North American countries to develop and test methodologies for analyzing step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact. The findings will inform targeted citizenship policies to maximize settlement success for immigrants and their children. This research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationships between citizenship, policy, and integration outcomes, ultimately informing evidence-based policy decisions to support migrant integration and social cohesion."
