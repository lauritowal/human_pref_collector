        "**Title:** Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project, PRILA, aims to examine how mechanisms for securing rights and accountability are experienced in European prisons. This study seeks to achieve adherence to the rule of law and ensure fair treatment of prisoners. By documenting experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies, this research will study the structures for fair, transparent, and consistent decisions, as well as appeal and review processes. The study will also investigate compliance with human rights principles.\n\nThis project addresses the overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences in European prisons, with a focus on power differentials and the expression of public and prison law values. The research will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and sociology of punishment. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods will be used to gather data.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include transforming and extending accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advancing judicial review of administrative action, and enhancing understanding of penal power experiences. The findings will contribute to advancing conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, supporting better penal policies and practices, and protecting the rule of law and rights in prisons."
