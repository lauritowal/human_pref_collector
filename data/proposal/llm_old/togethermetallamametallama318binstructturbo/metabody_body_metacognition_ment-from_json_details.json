        "**Title:** METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization, and Metamorphosis\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nMETABODY is a novel research project that seeks to understand the dynamic inference of body image, driven by the interplay between prior expectations and new information. In today's modern context, individuals constantly negotiate their body image, balancing invariance and invention, and striving for identity balance. This project aims to elucidate the complex relationship between body image, mentalization, and metamorphosis.\n\nThrough three empirical work packages: Body Metacognition (balancing embodied experience and external perspectives), Body Mentalizing (balancing embodied experience and social perspectives), and Body Decision Making (balancing current, future, and ideal body perspectives), METABODY will investigate the metacognitive level of body image disturbances. By examining the interplay between 1st and 2nd order abilities, this project will provide new insights into the negotiation of identity in the context of body modification options.\n\nBy understanding the dynamic inference of body image, METABODY aims to contribute to the development of novel interventions and therapies for individuals experiencing body image-related issues, ultimately promoting a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between body, mind, and identity."
