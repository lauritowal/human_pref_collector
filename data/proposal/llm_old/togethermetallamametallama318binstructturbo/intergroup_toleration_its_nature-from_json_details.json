        "**Title:** \"Intergroup toleration: It's Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\"\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to advance our understanding of the social psychology of intergroup toleration, a critical phenomenon in today's increasingly diverse societies. Despite the pressing need for harmonious coexistence, the underlying psychological mechanisms driving tolerance remain poorly understood. Our proposed research aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the underlying psychological aspects, processes, and consequences of intergroup toleration.\n\nUsing a multi-method approach combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of tolerance. Our research will elucidate the psychological processes underlying tolerance, identify its limits, and examine the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This project is novel and timely, as systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration is scarce. The expected outcome is the provision of insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society."
