        "**Title:** Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults, and Families\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the effects of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) on children, adults, and families, amidst an increasingly high number of MAR treatments (over 5 million in the last four decades). Despite the growing trend, prior research has yielded mixed results, largely due to low statistical power and conceptual limitations. This project seeks to bridge this gap with a comprehensive analysis, cross-domain comparisons, and innovative research designs to establish causality.\n\nUtilizing population registers and surveys as data sources, this study will analyze the long-term outcomes of MAR-conceived children and adults, including physical health, mental health, education, and union stability. By comparing MAR-conceived individuals to their spontaneously conceived counterparts, as well as successful versus unsuccessful MAR conceptions, this project will provide ground-breaking results, informing future research and policy decisions.\n\nThe proposed research will benefit health professionals, public health authorities, and policy-makers by providing evidence-based guidance on health advising, resource allocation, and MAR treatment subsidies. Ultimately, this project will enhance our understanding of the MAR phenomenon, fostering more informed decision-making and better support for families navigating this complex issue."
