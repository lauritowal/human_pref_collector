        "Title: Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis longitudinal study aims to elucidate the interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescent development. By integrating social network research and social brain research, we will investigate how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure in a cohort of 1000 adolescents. The study focuses on social-cognitive functions, including understanding and interacting with others, and utilizes a comprehensive set of tools, including social network analysis, social neuroscience experimental approaches, and ecological momentary assessment. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) yearly to examine brain network activity. Data will be collected from surveys and mobile sensing to capture social networks and social behaviors. This study will provide novel insights into the dynamic phase of adolescent development, shedding light on the complex interplay between social brain and social networks. The findings will have significant implications for the development of targeted interventions to promote healthy social development in adolescents."
