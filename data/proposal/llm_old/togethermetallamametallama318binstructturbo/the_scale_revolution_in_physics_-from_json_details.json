        "**Title:** The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\n\n**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThe RESCALE project proposes an in-depth, integrated historical and philosophical study of the emerging scale-based theoretical practice in modern physics. This project aims to understand how the ideal of a final theory has influenced modern physics and its philosophical interpretations, particularly in the shift towards theories that work only at certain scales since the 1950s.\n\nBy conducting a historical study of the evolution of scale-based theoretical practice in physics, this project will reveal a fundamental epistemological transformation in the recent history of science. A philosophical analysis of the implications of scale-based physics will examine how philosophers should adjust their interpretative practice in this context.\n\nThe project will explore the resulting world picture from a scale-based perspective, addressing the implications for our understanding of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics at the frontiers of science. The RESCALE project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex hierarchy of overlapping layers across scales, providing new insights into the nature of physical reality.\n\nThis research project will benefit both the scientific community and scholars of philosophy of science, offering a comprehensive understanding of the scale revolution in physics and its far-reaching implications."
