        "**Title:** Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a transdisciplinary research programme, 'Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes', aimed at redefining the representation of borders in the digital age. Our research focuses on the porous, shifting, and solidified nature of borders, which often operate beyond legal frameworks and exhibit variable enforcement of treaties. We propose to develop a digital atlas that utilizes topological concepts to represent borders as dynamic and multifaceted entities, rather than rigid and impenetrable lines.\n\nThrough a participative approach, leveraging digital technologies, such as GIS and Google Earth, and visual counter-geographies, our project will produce seamless transitions between different border experiences. By co-producing knowledge with migrants, security apparatus, and other stakeholders, we aim to disrupt traditional cartographic norms and offer a more nuanced understanding of border spaces.\n\nOur research questions how mapping can be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experiences of those who encounter them. This project has the potential to impact knowledge production in the fields of geography, anthropology, and international relations, offering new perspectives on the complexities of border management and migration."
