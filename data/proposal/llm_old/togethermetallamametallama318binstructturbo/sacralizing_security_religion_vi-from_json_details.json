        "**Title:** Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence, and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, titled \"Sacralizing Security,\" aims to explore the complex relationships between religion, violence, and authority in mega-cities of the Global South. The proposed study examines how state agencies' limited capacity to provide infrastructure and security has led to the emergence of religious vigilantes, who operate side-by-side with state actors to maintain order. Through an ethnographic comparison of case studies in Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, this research seeks to answer two primary questions: (1) why do mega-city residents grant authority to religious vigilantes, and (2) what is the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices?\n\nThis project contributes to the anthropology of religion and political anthropology by extending our understanding of the production of authority and power structures in mega-cities of the Global South. By analyzing the specificities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism, SACRASEC aims to provide knowledge on improving human security and inform policies that address the intersection of security, governance, and religion in these urban centers."
