        "**Title:** Towards an Evidence-Based Model for Big Data Policing: Evaluating the Statistical-Methodological, Criminological, and Legal and Ethical Conditions\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to address the knowledge gaps in big data policing in Europe by developing an evidence-based model that integrates statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions. Our objective is to create a comprehensive framework that can be tested through randomized controlled trials, ensuring transparency, predictive reliability, and validity. The project will focus on specific variables, including previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity. By addressing the fragmented expertise and lack of interdisciplinarity in big data policing studies, this project will contribute to the development of a more effective and equitable policing strategy. Our approach is distinct from commercial and economic initiatives, prioritizing transparency and adherence to legal and ethical standards. This research has the potential to inform policy and practice in big data policing, promoting a more evidence-based and accountable approach to policing in Europe."
