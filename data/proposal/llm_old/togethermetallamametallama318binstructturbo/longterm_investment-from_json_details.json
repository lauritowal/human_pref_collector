        "**Title:** Understanding the Determinants and Consequences of Long-Term Investment\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Long-Term Investment,\" aims to investigate the key factors that influence and shape long-term investment decisions in firms. This comprehensive study consists of three interconnected components: Financial Markets, Incentives, and Effects of Investment. The project seeks to address the challenges associated with long-term investment by examining the impact of intangible assets, such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture, on firm performance.\n\nThe research will investigate how firms have transformed from being capital-intensive and cost-efficient in the past to competing on product quality and relying on intangible assets in the present. Furthermore, the study will analyze how traditional financial markets, which often prioritize short-term shareholder focus, affect long-term investment decisions. Additionally, the project will examine the role of incentives in shaping managerial behavior and how the horizon of incentives influences long-term decisions.\n\nUltimately, this research aims to provide insights into the determinants and consequences of long-term investment, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the factors that influence firm value and performance. The findings of this study have the potential to inform business practices, policy decisions, and future research in the field of long-term investment."
