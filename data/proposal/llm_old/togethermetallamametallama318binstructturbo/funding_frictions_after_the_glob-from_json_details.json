        "**Title:** Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis\n\n**Key Project Characteristics:**\n\nThis project aims to investigate the impact of funding frictions on financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies in the post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. Building on the lessons from the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 market turmoil, this research will examine the manifestations of funding frictions, including elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and lack of credit market access.\n\n**Research Objectives:**\n\nThe project will address two primary research priorities: understanding the nature of funding frictions and optimizing policy responses to mitigate their effects. The research will focus on the key events that have shaped the global financial landscape since the GFC, including ballooning deficits in developed economies, tighter money market mutual funds regulation, pension risk transfers to life insurance companies, and tighter bank regulation.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\nThis project will provide valuable insights into funding costs and credit market access, as well as debt management strategies for sovereigns. The research will also enhance policy maker awareness of the regulatory consequences of funding frictions and inform evidence-based policy responses to reduce funding risk for institutions."
