        "**Title:** Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance: Organizational Circumstances Underlying Data Analysts' and Medical Experts' Decisions\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis multi-sited ethnographic study aims to investigate the organizational circumstances that influence data analysts and medical experts' decisions to follow or deviate from AI recommendations in national health governance settings. By examining the socio-cultural context of AI-informed decision-making, this research seeks to address significant gaps in our understanding of human-AI collaboration. Through future-scenarioing anthropological methods and collaboration with health decision-makers and policy institutions, we will develop a theory on the organizational factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption of ethical AI practices. This theory will be grounded in empirical evidence from six national settings, providing insights into the impact of human-AI collaboration on national health policies and individual lives. By shedding light on the complex dynamics of human-AI interaction, this research aims to inform the development of more effective and responsible AI systems in national health governance."
