        "**Title:** Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans,\" aims to develop a comprehensive, pan-European chronology for the last 2.6 million years. By combining amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating methods, we will address the current limitations of radiocarbon dating, which only extends back approximately 60,000 years. Our research will focus on the Quaternary period, examining the impact of climatic oscillations, expansion of ice sheets, and sea-level changes on human evolution and migration in Europe.\n\nThis project will investigate key critical questions, including the timing of early human expansion into Europe, climatic conditions during human expansion, and differences in tool technologies. By refining our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics, this research will provide essential insights into the relationship between environmental change and human evolution over the last 2.6 million years.\n\nThe proposed project will have a significant impact on our understanding of human history in Europe, providing a breakthrough in our ability to reconstruct the past. With a focus on Europe, this research will contribute to the development of a broader, pan-Eurasian chronology for the entire Paleolithic period, shedding new light on human migration, cultural dynamics, and environmental change over the Quaternary period."
