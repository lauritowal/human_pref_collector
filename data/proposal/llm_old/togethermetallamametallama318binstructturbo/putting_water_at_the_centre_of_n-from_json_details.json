        "**Title:** Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History: A Novel Historical Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"NUCLEARWATERS,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of nuclear energy history by shifting the focus from traditional power and politics to the neglected yet crucial role of water. Our research argues that nuclear energy is, fundamentally, a hydraulic technology. Through a six-package investigation, we will uncover the hitherto overlooked connections between hydraulic civilizations, water-manipulating technologies, and the development of nuclear energy.\n\nBy exploring the historical contexts of centuries of hydraulic engineering, the Soviet Union's nuclear water management systems, the Rhine Valley's nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region's nuclear-hydraulic dynamics, we aim to resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history. Our water-centred approach promises to revise the field of nuclear energy history, with far-reaching implications for the history of technology, environmental history, and public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond.\n\nThis project will forge a new nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and producing a groundbreaking, water-centric history of nuclear energy that will reshape our understanding of this complex and contentious field."
