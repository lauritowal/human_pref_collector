        "**Title:** The Everyday Politics of Famine: A Comparative Study of Famines in South Sudan and Somalia\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" aims to investigate the persistent nature of famines in communities, with a focus on South Sudan and Somalia. In recent years, famines have become increasingly frequent and deadly, affecting 250,000 people in 2022 and leaving 35 million on the edge of famine. Despite this, the underlying factors contributing to famine persist, and the social and cultural contexts in which famines occur remain poorly understood.\n\nThis project will employ an ethnographically-informed comparative study to shed light on the everyday politics of famine. Through an examination of historical and contemporary narratives, community practices, and media representation, we will identify the key drivers of famine and the ways in which societies respond to and perpetuate these crises.\n\nOur research team, composed of Somali and South Sudanese scholars, brings extensive experience, networks, and capacity to the project. This team will conduct a multi-stranded investigation, including the analysis of histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics.\n\nBy shifting the focus from macro-level explanations to the micro-level practices and narratives that shape famine experiences, this project aims to contribute to a new understanding of the science of famine politics and to inform more effective policies and interventions to prevent and mitigate famine."
