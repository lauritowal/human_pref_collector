        "**Title:** The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, The Formal Turn, aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the emergence of formalism in twentieth-century thought. Focusing on the first half of the century, our proposal undertakes an in-depth, comparative study of early contributions to formalism, bridging the fields of philosophy of science and logic.\n\nThrough a three-pronged approach, we will reconstruct the historical development of formalism (1860-1910), exploring the intersections of nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology. We will then conduct a comparative study of formal logic and logical empiricism (1920-1940), examining the works of key figures such as David Hilbert, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. Finally, we will analyze the philosophical implications of formalism, investigating its effects on semantics, model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nThis project will shed new light on the development of formalism and its far-reaching consequences for the fields of logic, philosophy of science, and mathematics. Our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between formal methods and philosophical inquiry, ultimately enriching the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century."
