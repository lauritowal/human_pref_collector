        "**Title:** Truth and Semantics: A Unified Perspective on Natural Language\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding natural language semantics through the lens of truth-conditional semantics. The project aims to address the long-standing challenges of \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics\" by developing a unified perspective on the role of truth in natural language semantics. To achieve this, the project will focus on two primary objectives:\n\n1. Developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, incorporating the notions of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals.\n2. Examining the metasemantic role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics, providing a systematic study of the interplay between truth and semantics.\n\nThe outcome of this project will be the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, offering significant contributions to the field of linguistics and philosophy. By advancing our understanding of truth in natural language, this research will have far-reaching implications for the development of more accurate and comprehensive semantic theories."
