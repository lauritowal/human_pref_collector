        "**Title:** Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project examines the intersections between theatre, nationalism, and politics in Turkey and its diasporas, spanning from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a transdisciplinary approach combining theoretical and ethnographic research methods, this study investigates the role of theatre in constituting national identity and its Others. The project focuses on five case studies, including Armenian, queer, Islamic, Sephardic Jewish, and Alevi theatre productions in Turkey and European diasporas.\n\nThe research objectives aim to illuminate the complex politics of belonging in the nation-state, the politics of citizenship, and the impact of neoliberalism on contemporary Turkish theatre. This study also explores the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship, advancing understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe and cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.\n\nBy analyzing theatre as a site of national abjection, this project provides a nuanced understanding of the tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the fields of theatre and performance studies, cultural studies, and politics, offering new insights into the complex relationships between art, identity, and politics."
