        "**Title:** Wage Inequality within and across Firms: A Comprehensive Analysis of Market Forces, Government Policies, and Firm Decisions\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal investigates the factors contributing to wage inequality within and across firms in industrialized countries over the past decades. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between market forces, government policies, and firm decisions, with an emphasis on their impact on gender inequality. Our analysis spans four decades, utilizing a rich dataset comprising German social security records, survey data, and administrative records.\n\nWe examine three key aspects: (1) the role of market forces, including product market competition and routine-biased technological change, on wage inequality between firms; (2) the effects of government policies, such as minimum wage introduction and business tax rate changes, on wage inequality; and (3) the impact of firm policies, including family-friendly policies and flexible working times, on wage inequality and mothers' return-to-work decisions.\n\nThis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving wage inequality and to inform policies that promote greater equality in the workplace. The findings of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the development of more effective policies to address wage inequality and promote greater equality in the labor market."
