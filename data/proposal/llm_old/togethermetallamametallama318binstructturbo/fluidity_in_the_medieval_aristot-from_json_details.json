        "**Title:** Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive investigation into new ways to read the Latin Aristotle, a pivotal figure in late medieval and early modern philosophy, science, and theology. By examining hundreds of manuscript witnesses from the 12th and 13th centuries, this project aims to develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science. Our research focuses on textual variance in handwritten books preserving translations of critical Aristotelian treatises, including De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo. We will document variant readings in manuscript witnesses, providing evidence of how readers were exposed to recently available translations differing fundamentally from the Greek originals. This study will contribute significantly to our understanding of textual fluidity in manuscripts, shedding light on the complex relationships between readers, translators, and the written word. Ultimately, this research will enhance our knowledge of the medieval intellectual landscape and its enduring impact on the development of Western thought."
