        "**Title:** Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive investigation into the earliest evidence of animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent. Focusing on the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent, our research aims to unravel the paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates. Through biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, we will examine the early evidence of sheep and goat management, shedding light on the mechanisms that led to their domestication.\n\nOur research will explore the control of animals' reproductive cycles, changes to animals' feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. By analyzing faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers, we will identify how human societies changed the animals and establish when and where animal domestication processes began.\n\nThis study will significantly contribute to our understanding of the Neolithic archaeological research on animal domestication, providing new insights into the earliest domestication processes in the Fertile Crescent. Our findings will have far-reaching implications for the fields of archaeology, anthropology, and animal science, ultimately revealing the complex dynamics between humans and animals in the early stages of domestication."
