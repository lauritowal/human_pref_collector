        "**Title:** Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project, \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong,\" aims to investigate the ways in which cultural practices in mainland China and Hong Kong express and critique social and political discontent. Through a comparative analysis of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, this project seeks to understand the resilience and vitality of cultural production in the face of authoritarianism.\n\nBy examining indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, this research will shed light on the complex relationships between cultural expression and social critique in the regions. The project will employ a methodological toolkit of ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research to gather and analyze data.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to contribute to a multivocal understanding of cultural production in mainland China and Hong Kong, highlighting the diversity and vitality of these regions' cultural landscapes. Through comparative contexts with other countries such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, this research will foster global dialogue and collaboration among scholars and artists."
