        "**Title:** GOODATTENTION: Investigating Attention Norms in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled GOODATTENTION, seeks to provide a comprehensive philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for understanding their role in various fields, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, ethics, evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, economics, and political theory. By integrating insights from these disciplines, GOODATTENTION aims to advance our understanding of how attention norms emerge within individual psychology and in the social domain.\n\nOur primary goal is to develop a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind, allowing us to evaluate attention norms and their implications for practical reason, epistemology, and ethics. We hypothesize that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance, which will be investigated through a range of research activities, including the biological function of relevance processing, the role of social relevance in guiding attention, and the epistemic and ethical implications of attention norms.\n\nThe expected impact of GOODATTENTION includes the integration of attention norms into normative philosophy, providing an analytical framework for policy making, and shedding light on the complex relationships between attention, relevance, and decision making."
