        "**Title: Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic: A Global Analysis (1855-1959)**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the visual representation of the Third Plague Pandemic (1855-1959), a devastating global health crisis that claimed over 12 million lives. By focusing on the intersection of photography, built environment, civil disturbance, death, and social inequality, this project seeks to understand how visual representations influenced the global response to the pandemic.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach, combining historical and anthropological analysis, this project will examine the ways in which visual representations were used in China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America to convey the impact of the pandemic. By considering the role of photography in shaping public perception and policy responses, this research will shed new light on the complex dynamics of disease transmission, social inequality, and global health.\n\nThis project will be led by a Principal Investigator, supported by three postdoctoral researchers, and will be conducted full-time over a specified period. The research team will employ a range of analytical methods to explore the visual representations of the Third Plague Pandemic, providing a nuanced understanding of this critical moment in global health history. The findings of this project will contribute to the development of more effective global health policies and strategies, and will provide a valuable resource for scholars, policymakers, and the general public."
