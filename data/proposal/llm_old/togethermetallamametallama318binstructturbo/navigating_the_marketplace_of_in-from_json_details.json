        "**Title:** Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators: Investigating Country Performance Indicators in Evolving Policy Fields\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators,\" aims to investigate the complex landscape of country performance indicators (CPIs) across multiple policy fields, including education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. Despite the simplification of individual CPIs, the abundance of these indicators multiplies complexity, hindering a clear understanding of country performance and policy effectiveness. This research seeks to address the gap in navigation of policy fields with multiple CPIs by examining the adaptation of CPI users and producers over time.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the marketplace of ideas, this project will employ a systemic and longitudinal analysis to explore the dynamics of CPI production and consumption. The study will focus on two key aspects: (1) learning from CPI criticism and decision-making with diverse CPIs among users, and (2) competition within crowded policy fields among producers. This research aims to advance CPI research by shifting the problem-solving paradigm from individual indicators to the systematic analysis of policy fields.\n\nThe findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of CPIs and inform the development of more effective policy-making tools, ultimately improving country performance and global governance."
