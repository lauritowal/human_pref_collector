        "**Title:** Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of how vision is affected by physiological state and personality traits in normally sighted individuals, including young children. By combining ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance imaging of the human visual cortex with psychophysics and pupil responses, we will investigate the behavioral and cortical properties associated with individual differences in visual perception. Specifically, we will examine how metabolic interventions, such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, influence perceptual styles within individuals.\n\nOur innovative approach integrates physiological interventions with visual processing measures, providing new insights into the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception. This research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders, and inform therapeutic approaches affecting general physiology. We anticipate that this study will yield new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and provide evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolism."
