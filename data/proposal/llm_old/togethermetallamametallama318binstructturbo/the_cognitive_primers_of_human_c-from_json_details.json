        "**Title:** The Cognitive Primers of Human Culture: A Comparative Approach to the Emergence of Innovations\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to investigate the conditions driving innovations, specifically the ability to create and use sharp stone tools (flakes), across primates. Focusing on chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques, the study will utilize a triangulation approach, artificial intelligence coding methods, and an experimental paradigm to define baseline stone manipulation propensities and test the roles of exposure and experience as drivers of innovations. The research will involve a large sample size (N=350) and long-term testing protocols (approximately 4 years). By comparing primate assemblages to the oldest human stone tools, this study seeks to infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. The findings will provide an enhanced understanding of the conditions required for innovations and the primers of human culture, which will have significant implications for our understanding of human cultural development. This research will contribute to the field of cognitive anthropology, primatology, and innovation studies."
