        "**Title:** Time to Pay Up? Reparations and Global Development Challenges\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, REPAIR, seeks to address the growing calls for reparations in global development contexts. By comparing reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments, this study aims to shed light on the complexities of reparations payments in addressing global development challenges. This project will investigate how reparations are established, implemented, and received, and what these payments reveal about reparations in development from economic, moral, and political perspectives.\n\nThis comparative social-science study will provide novel insights into the 'reparative aspects' of economic life by examining reparations as a form of wealth transfer. Utilizing theory and methods from economic anthropology, REPAIR will broaden the comparative frame of reparations study and contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of reparations in global development. The findings of this project will have significant implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to address the complex challenges of global development."
