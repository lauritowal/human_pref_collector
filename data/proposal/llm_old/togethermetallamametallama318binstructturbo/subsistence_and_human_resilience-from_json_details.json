        "Title: Subsistence and Human Resilience to Sudden Climatic Events in Europe during MIS3\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project explores the impact of climate changes on the subsistence strategies of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Southern Europe. By analyzing zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope data from 20 key locations, this study aims to reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions, assess behavioural flexibility and resilience, and estimate ecosystem carrying capacity.\n\nOur objectives are to identify subsistence patterns favoring AMH, assess the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction, and contribute to a pan-European understanding of prehistory. By shedding light on the climate-related challenges faced by these early human populations, this research has the potential to inform our understanding of the factors that influenced the replacement of Neanderthals by AMH in Europe.\n\nThis project will advance our knowledge of human adaptation to climate change and provide valuable insights into the resilience and flexibility of human societies in the face of sudden and extreme environmental events."
