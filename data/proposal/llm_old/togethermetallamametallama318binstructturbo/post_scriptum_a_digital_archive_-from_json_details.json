        "**Title:** Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, Post Scriptum, aims to create a comprehensive digital archive of ordinary writings from 17th to early 19th century Portugal and Spain. The proposed archive will collect and analyze personal letters from diverse authors, including servants, children, wives, and artisans, among others. These letters, often overlooked in historical records, will be studied through systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic analysis. The project will also incorporate sociological interviews to contextualize the findings. The research focus will be on well-contextualized studies of inter-personal modes of relation and traditional communities, examining the expression of emotions, oral rhetoric, and confession of non-orthodox beliefs. The project output will include a large collection assembly, online digital edition, philological treatment, and cultural and linguistic studies, all guided by Textual Criticism standards. This innovative project seeks to provide new insights into the lives and experiences of ordinary people during this period, shedding light on the diverse voices and perspectives of early modern Portugal and Spain."
