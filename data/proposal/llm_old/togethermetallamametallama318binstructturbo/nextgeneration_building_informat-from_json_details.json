        "**Title:** NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe built environment significantly influences human behavior, impacting people's daily lives, productivity, and overall well-being. Current building information modeling (BIM) tools, however, are limited in their ability to represent buildings beyond their physical and material characteristics. These shortcomings hinder the evaluation of buildings' effects on occupants and their activities, often resulting in inadequate assessments of whether a building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nThis research aims to address these limitations by developing a comprehensive building modeling method that includes form, function, and use information. By integrating user behavior and context into BIM systems, this project seeks to enhance the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment. The proposed research will yield significant benefits, including better-designed buildings that cater to the needs of their occupants.\n\nThe proposed project is situated within the broader context of the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth. It has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of human behavior in built environments and contribute to the development of more sustainable, accessible, and user-friendly buildings. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a next-generation BIM system that supports the evaluation of human behavior in built environments, ultimately leading to more effective and user-centered building design."
