        "**Title:** Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the global pharmaceutical drug market using Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a case study in two African countries (Benin and Ghana) with differing pharmaceutical systems, and a comparison study in Cambodia. The project seeks to understand the realities affecting the global drug market in terms of supply and demand, analyze globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana, and study public health consequences.\n\nThe research will employ a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating Anthropology, Epidemiology, and Sociology, to examine the formal and informal pharmaceutical supply chains, drug use patterns, and local production and regulations of ACTs. The project will also investigate the scope of ACT consumption, the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa, and the impact of globalizing processes on the pharmaceutical market.\n\nThis research aims to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project will support the training of 11 early-stage researchers (8 Master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 postdoctoral researcher) and will be supported by the Principal Investigator's expertise and solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana. The project outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of the global pharmaceutical market and its impact on public health in Africa and Asia."
