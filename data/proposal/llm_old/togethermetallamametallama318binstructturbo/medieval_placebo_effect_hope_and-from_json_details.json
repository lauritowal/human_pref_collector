        "**Title:** MedPlaceboEffect: Unraveling the Medieval Roots of Hope and Belief in Healthcare\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, titled \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500,\" aims to explore the complex dynamics of healing in medieval Southern Europe. By employing a triangular approach, examining ideas, practices, and organizing structures, this project seeks to identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect and its implications for contemporary healthcare.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of medieval medical and cultural texts, as well as archaeological and art historical evidence, this research will demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities in medieval healing practices and institutions. By exploring the interplay between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing, this project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the therapy elements in medieval healing and their impact on the mind-body connection.\n\nThe findings of this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the placebo effect and its legacy in contemporary healthcare, shedding light on the challenges of distrust in medical services and the difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research. Ultimately, this research will provide a foundation for examining the complex dynamics of healing practices in the 21st century and their historical roots in medieval Southern Europe."
