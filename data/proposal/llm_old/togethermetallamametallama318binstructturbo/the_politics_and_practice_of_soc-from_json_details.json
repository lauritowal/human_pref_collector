        "**Title:** The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis 5-year research project, 'The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict', aims to extend Internet reach to remote regions and explore the complex dynamics of social media in conflict-affected communities. Focusing on non-urban areas, affordable access, and the world's poorest regions with weak state presence, the project targets conflict-affected communities in Africa, particularly Eastern Africa.\n\nAt its core, the project seeks to address the key puzzle of how social media access impacts peace-building versus perpetuating violence. The research will be guided by three specific questions: (1) How does social media alter transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? (2) How do public authorities use social media to encourage violence or promote peace? (3) How is social media changing people's experiences with violent conflict?\n\nThrough examination of contexts such as dangerous speech online, exit and entry of individuals from/into conflict, and governance actors' use of social media, this project will provide critical insights into the politics and practice of social media in conflict. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between social media, conflict, and peacebuilding, with significant implications for policymakers and practitioners working in conflict-affected regions."
