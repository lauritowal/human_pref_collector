        "**Title:** Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time. Through a multidisciplinary approach, combining phylogenetic modeling, corpus linguistics, surveys, interviews, and participant observation, we aim to analyze patterns of kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, and link individual usage patterns to historical processes. We will analyze kinship terminologies and family norms in eight language families and explore how children acquire and understand kinship concepts in small-scale, non-Western communities. Our research will shed light on the evolution of kinship diversity, its universality, and the factors that contribute to its variation. By integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between language, cognition, and social norms. This study has significant implications for our understanding of human culture and evolution, and will contribute to the development of new theoretical frameworks in anthropology, linguistics, and psychology."
