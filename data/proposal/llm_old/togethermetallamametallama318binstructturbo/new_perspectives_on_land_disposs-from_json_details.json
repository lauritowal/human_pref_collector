        "**Title: New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict, and Migration in the West African Sahel**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to advance understanding of the complex relationships between land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel. Focusing on Mali as a case study, we will investigate the link between land dispossession and the propensity for smallholder farmers and pastoralists to engage in violent resistance or migrate. Our hypothesis is that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, and that violent resistance is linked to the rise of 'jihadist' groups.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative fieldwork and quantitative analysis, this project will engage with key theoretical frameworks in political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies. The expected outcomes of this research include novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, new knowledge on interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and ideas for policy formulation.\n\nBy shedding light on the intricate dynamics driving land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration, this project aims to contribute meaningful and actionable knowledge that can inform policy and practice in the region, ultimately promoting more sustainable and equitable development outcomes in the West African Sahel."
