        "**Title:** The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of the Medieval and Early Modern nautical chart, a topic long understudied in maritime expansion. The History of Cartography is a rich and complex subject, but the technical study of pre-Mercator nautical charts is still in its infancy. This project proposes to fill this gap by addressing a broader and more complex set of questions about the origins, evolution, and use of these charts.\n\nUsing an interdisciplinary approach, this research will employ analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and the examination of manuscripts through special lighting to unveil hidden graphic content and characterize the main geometric features of these charts. By establishing connections with navigational methods and simulating chart construction numerically, this project aims to shed new light on the intellectual history of cartography and its impact on maritime expansion.\n\nBuilding on previous work, such as the solution of the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this research will explore the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts over a longer period, with far-reaching implications for the History of Cartography and intellectual history at large. This project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the development of navigational tools and their impact on human exploration and commerce."
