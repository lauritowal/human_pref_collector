        "**Title:** Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC) project is a comprehensive research initiative that seeks to understand the role of emotions in shaping citizens' political choices and politicians' strategic decisions. This comparative study, spanning nine countries and spanning from 1945 to the present day, aims to address three key research questions: (1) Do emotional appeals affect citizens' political choices? (2) Do politicians make more emotional appeals than in the past? and (3) Why are politicians making more emotional appeals?\n\nUsing innovative automated text analysis and physiological measurement methods, POLEMIC will test three prominent theories: the vote-maximizing strategy, the product of politician's personality, and the fashionable trend. By examining both macro (what politicians say) and micro (how citizens respond) perspectives, this project bridges the fields of party politics and political psychology.\n\nThe expected outcomes of POLEMIC include a deeper understanding of the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. This knowledge will provide valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to navigate the complex interplay between emotions and politics."
