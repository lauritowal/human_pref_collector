        "**Title:** Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires (GoviB)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires (GoviB), seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of governance and politics in ancient Babylon during the late 8th to 4th centuries BC. This period saw the rise and fall of three empires: the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian. Through a comprehensive analysis of Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological findings from German excavations in Babylon, and other relevant materials from the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin, this study aims to illuminate the local negotiation of imperial rule and the strategies employed by rulers to maintain stability or address instability.\n\nDespite the historical significance of this period, the existing data presents challenges due to its incomplete and often ambivalent or conflicting nature. Therefore, the GoviB project employs a governance studies conceptual framework to provide a structured approach to data interpretation and analysis. The proposed research seeks to evaluate the impact of these empires on cultural transformation and shed light on modern perceptions of oriental governance and regime stability.\n\nBy exploring the complexities of governance in ancient Babylon, this project will yield valuable insights into the politics and authority of the time, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics between imperial rule and local negotiation."
