        "**Title:** Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary research project, \"Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies,\" seeks to investigate the impact of creative Artificial Intelligence (AI) on our understanding of art, culture, and society. Through the development of instruments with creative AI and the exploration of human-AI collaboration in music, this project aims to initiate public discourse on the transformative potential of AI. By leveraging sonic instruments as scientific instruments, we will examine the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and its reflection in future society.\n\nThis project brings together diverse scientific disciplines, including music, philosophy, computer science, and AI, to develop a theoretical framework for transformed notions of self, others, and knowledge. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the development of human-centred creative AI and the definition of principles for ethical AI design in services and products. Ultimately, this project aims to foster a deeper understanding of the complexities of creative AI and its implications for our shared human experience."
