        "**Title:** Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to redefine the concept of world literature by examining the complex interactions between multilingual locals and significant geographies. Our project, 'Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature', will investigate how literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions shape the global literary landscape. Focusing on north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, we will analyze the local transculturations, debates on world literature, and forms of multilingualism that have emerged during the imperial consolidation, decolonization, and current globalizing moment.\n\nOur approach, grounded in multilingual and located approaches, will uncover the monolingual straitjacket and modern literary histories partition that have constrained our understanding of world literature. By appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices and trajectories, we will develop a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues to ensure the entry of non-Western literature into the global canon. This interdisciplinary project will be realized through collaboration with scholars from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, UK, and France, and will contribute significantly to the redefinition of world literature."
