        "**Title:** The Design, Creation and Survival of Democratic Laws: A Computational Analysis of Legislative Texts\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, DEMOLAW, aims to provide a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design and an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival. By analyzing legislative texts in the US, UK, and EU, we will answer three major research questions: (1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law? (2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary? and (3) How can we explain the stability or change in laws over time?\n\nUtilizing cutting-edge computational methods, this project will make significant methodological advancements for the analysis of legislative content. The objectives of DEMOLAW are to identify key dimensions that influence the design of laws, understand the underlying reasons for variations in legislative design across different political systems, and shed light on the factors that contribute to the stability or change of laws over time.\n\nThe expected contributions of this project are a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design, an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival, and methodological advancements for computational analysis of legislative content. This research will have significant implications for our understanding of democratic governance and the development of effective legislation."
