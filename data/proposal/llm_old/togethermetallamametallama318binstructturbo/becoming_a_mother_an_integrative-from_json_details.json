        "**Becoming a Mother: An Integrative Model of Adaptations for Motherhood**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop an integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we will investigate the dynamic changes in brain structure and function that occur in nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy. Our objectives are to establish when brain changes begin, characterize cognitive performance, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, assess the effects of environmental and psychological factors, and identify metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations.\n\nOur study will collect neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data across five time points: pre-pregnancy, intra-pregnancy, and postpartum. We will recruit three participant groups: nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, their same-sex partners, and control nulliparous women. The study will produce a longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, intermediate longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sectional analyses.\n\nThis research has the potential to advance our understanding of the complex adaptations that occur in motherhood and inform the development of evidence-based interventions to support maternal mental health. The proposed project will provide a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding maternal adaptations, ultimately contributing to improved maternal and infant outcomes."
