        "**Title:** The values of French language and literature in the European Middle Ages\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to reevaluate the importance of French language and literature in Europe during the Middle Ages (1100-1450). As a supralocal, transnational language, French played a significant role in shaping linguistic identity in Europe. This project seeks to answer two key research questions: the historical relation between language and identity, and the demarcation of cognate languages from each other.\n\nThrough collaboration between scholars from European countries and North America, this project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology. The project's goals include empirical research on the textual tradition of 'L'Histoire ancienne jusqu'à César' and speculative reflection on linguistic identity.\n\nBy interrogating the role of French language in the emergence of a European identity, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of linguistic identity in the Middle Ages. The findings of this research will shed new light on the significance of French language and literature in shaping European cultural heritage."
