        "**Title:** Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the long-lasting changes in human brain structure associated with pregnancy. Building on existing research, our project aims to comprehensively map brain anatomy and function across the pregnancy and postpartum period. By tracking women from before conception through postpartum, we will utilize cutting-edge neuroimaging, psychopedagogic measures, and biomedical measures to pinpoint key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity.\n\nThe proposed study will focus on three critical areas: maternal caregiving, mental health disorders, and memory issues. By elucidating neural substrates for potential adaptive and maladaptive processes, our research will reveal the complex interplay between pregnancy and neuroplasticity. The findings of this project will establish a foundation for an emerging field of human neuroscience and provide critical insights into the neurobiological journey to motherhood. Ultimately, our research will contribute to the development of novel interventions and therapies for pregnant women and new mothers, promoting a better understanding of pregnancy-related neuroplasticity and its implications for maternal health and well-being."
