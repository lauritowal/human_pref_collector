        "**Title:** Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies in 25 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010. The project seeks to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields, particularly in the areas of Life and Death (abortion, euthanasia), Sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality), and Addictive substances and behavior. Using a macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies, the project will investigate the impact of international and domestic factors on policy changes. The research will rely on legislative output data and select critical cases based on the results of the quantitative study. This project contributes to the understanding of policy dynamics and the interplay of international and domestic factors in shaping morality policies. The findings will have implications for policymakers and scholars of public policy, providing insights into the complexities of policy development and changes in policy fields over time."
