        "**Title:** Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, GLOBECOSAL, aims to reexamine the role of art in shaping the negotiation of sanctity within Catholic communities during the post-Tridentine era, a time of significant global change. By tracing the circulation of material objects, analyzing iconographies, and exploring global networks of knowledge transmission, this research project seeks to challenge prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism and its relationship with colonialism in the early modern world.\n\nThrough a critical sociological lens, GLOBECOSAL will investigate how artworks, as sites of self-representation and social identity formation, reveal the complex negotiation of spiritual status within Catholic communities. By recognizing the agency of local constructions of sanctity and the role of Iberian empires in shaping the global market of symbolic values, this project aims to globalize the history of early modern art and affirm the society's capacity to produce saints.\n\nBy examining the complex dynamics between the Catholic Church and its Protestant counterparts, GLOBECOSAL will contribute to a deeper understanding of the ways in which art was used as a tool for negotiating sanctity and spiritual authority."
