        "**Title:** Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the role of effort in the reproduction of social inequality, advancing knowledge on intergenerational mobility and improving equality of opportunity. We seek to understand to what extent children's effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background, whether existing disparities in effort by social background can be explained by the intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations, and what the best techniques are to measure cognitive effort. Our proposed research will employ cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry, with a sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. We will analyze experimental data, subjective effort dispositions using (inter)national surveys, and triangulate methodologies for a comprehensive understanding of effort differentials. This project will provide first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity, offer insights for educational practitioners, and contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design."
