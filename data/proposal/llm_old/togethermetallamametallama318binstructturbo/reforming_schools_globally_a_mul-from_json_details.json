        "**Title:** Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, REFORMED, aims to investigate the global dissemination and effects of School Autonomy and Workforce Accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector. This comprehensive research project will employ a multi-scalar and multi-method approach to analyze the adoption, reformulation, and effects of SAWA policies in diverse countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development. Our inquiry focus will be on institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes, considering the perspectives of international bureaucrats and teachers. The study will explore the dissemination of SAWA policies, policy convergence, contextual and institutional circumstances of policy adoption, and the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity. By addressing the existing research gaps, this project will contribute to the development of a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of education policy reform. The findings of this study will be useful for international organizations, policymakers, and educators seeking to promote more effective and equitable education policies globally."
