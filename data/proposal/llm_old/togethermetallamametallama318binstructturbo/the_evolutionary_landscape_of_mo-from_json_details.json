        "**Title:** NGIPALAJEM: Unraveling the Evolutionary Landscape of Modern Human Origins in Africa\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal, NGIPALAJEM, aims to shed light on the complex evolutionary history of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in Africa, a period marked by significant climatic changes and shifts in large mammal communities. Spanning over 1 million years, the Early Pleistocene to Mid-Pleistocene Transition (EMPT) was characterized by greater climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, which likely had a profound impact on human evolution.\n\nOur project will focus on the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas, with a specific emphasis on the discovery of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. To achieve this, we will conduct fieldwork in the Turkana region, collecting new specimens to add to the hominin fossil record and increase the large vertebrate fossil record. Our analyses will employ novel morphometric and analytical techniques, including inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative studies.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to establish empirical benchmarks and answer big questions about human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape. Ultimately, we expect to gain a new understanding of human evolution, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental pressures, human behavior, and species adaptation."
