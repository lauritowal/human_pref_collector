        "**Grant Proposal Title:** An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nIn response to the global crisis of material depletion, this interdisciplinary research project proposes an innovative eco-metabolistic framework to catalyze architecture's transition to bio-based materials. Through a research-by-design approach, we will investigate the potential of glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria as key materials in sustainable building practices. Our framework integrates predictive modeling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing to optimize design solutions that are carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized.\n\nThis project challenges traditional design agency by proposing new practices that exploit the short lifespans of bio-based materials, enabling continual construction beyond building completion. Our objectives are to develop participatory practices, socially conscious models of production, and democratic models of production that promote sustainable and socially responsible architecture. By operationalizing the eco-metabolistic framework, we aim to redefine the fundamental value proposition of architecture and contribute to a more sustainable built environment."
