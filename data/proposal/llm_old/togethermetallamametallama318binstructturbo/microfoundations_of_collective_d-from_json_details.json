        "**Title:** Microfoundations of Collective Defence: A Cross-National Investigation of Public Opinion and Decision-Making in NATO Member States\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to initiate a new research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence by investigating the views of individuals in key NATO member states. Through an extensive, cross-national study, we aim to elucidate the formation of attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios, the aggregation of individual attitudes to form public opinion, and the influence of public opinion on decision-makers in allied states.\n\nBy employing novel immersive mixed-media experiments, this project will provide a unique insight into the strategic context's impact on public opinion formation and its subsequent influence on decision-makers. The proposed research aims to address three key hypotheses: (1) the strategic context impacts the formation of public opinion; (2) conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limit the role of public opinion; and (3) ambiguous 'grey zone' conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making.\n\nThis research has significant policy implications for the stability and credibility of military alliances. Findings from this project could redefine the dynamics of collective defence and inform policymakers on how to effectively engage with public opinion in the face of emerging security threats."
