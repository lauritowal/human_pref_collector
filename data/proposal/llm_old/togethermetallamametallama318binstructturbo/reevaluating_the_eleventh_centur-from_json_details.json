        "**Title:** Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to revolutionize the curation and analysis of historical data by developing a novel framework for digital data creation and curation. By reframing historical data as assertions linked to an authority, this project enables historians to manipulate and contextualize existing online data, preventing waste and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. Drawing on prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, this research aims to re-examine the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095) in the eastern half of Christendom and newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe.\n\nThe proposed methodology involves re-framing historical data as assertions linked to an authority, allowing for the manipulation of data based on source and authority, and enabling the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict. By acknowledging the complexity of pre-modern history with few undisputed facts, this project seeks to view history from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework. This innovative approach has the potential to uncover trans-regional trends obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom, and shed new light on this pivotal period in medieval history."
