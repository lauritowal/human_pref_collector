        "**Title:** Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to Southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to elucidate the dispersal of Pliocene hominins to southern Africa through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. The investigation focuses on understanding the key factors that influenced the dispersal, including geomorphological and palaeoecological changes, dynamic palaeo-precipitation and vegetation models, and anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of fossil records.\n\nWe propose to test several hypotheses related to the timing and mechanisms of hominin dispersal, including the expansion and contraction of East African hominin ranges, the impact of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation on dispersal corridors, and the role of tectonic and hydrographic changes in shaping the distribution of southern African hominins. By integrating palaeoecological, anatomical, and genetic data, we aim to reconstruct the dispersal scenarios and species diversity dynamics of Pliocene hominins in southern Africa.\n\nThis project will provide new insights into the evolution of human species and their adaptation to diverse environments, ultimately shedding light on the complex processes that have shaped human history. The findings of this research will have significant implications for our understanding of human origins and dispersal, and will contribute to the development of innovative hypotheses and research directions in the field of palaeoanthropology.
