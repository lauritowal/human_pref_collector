        "**Title:** Neural Mechanisms of Learning in the Infant Brain: From Statistics to Rules and Symbols\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying human learning from birth to the end of the first year of life. We propose a comprehensive study of infant learning in two critical domains: language and complex social interactions. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, our research will incorporate human cerebral architecture, access to a rich symbolic system, and cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography.\n\nOur six-work-package study will span 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life, investigating the development of statistical inferences, the consequences of different pre-term environments, the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, and the emergence of symbolic competency criteria. We will also develop new tools for multimodal brain image analysis.\n\nBy shedding light on the neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits, this research will significantly advance our understanding of infant brain development and its relation to learning processes. The findings of this study will have far-reaching implications for the development of early interventions and educational strategies tailored to the specific needs of infants and young children."
