        "**Title:** Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School: A Serious Game Intervention to Address Peer Rejection and Victimization\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop and assess the effectiveness of a serious game, A.L.I.B.I., designed to support children's transition to high school by promoting prosocial behaviors and stress-regulation skills. The game, set in a virtual high school environment, allows players to interact with teachers and peers in a realistic yet safe setting. By uncovering an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, players engage in prosocial interactions, practice perspective-taking, and consider multiple response options to navigate conflictual relationships. A.L.I.B.I.'s appeal lies in its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer.\n\nOur team, led by ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay, will collaborate with three school counseling organizations to implement A.L.I.B.I. in three regions of The Netherlands. The project will achieve four primary goals: (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game; (2) assess the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I. in addressing peer rejection and victimization; (3) integrate A.L.I.B.I. into ongoing school transition trainings; and (4) develop a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. This project has the potential to positively impact children's self-regulation, stress-regulation, and overall well-being during a critical phase of their educational journey."
