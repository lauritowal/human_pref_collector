        "**Title:** Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin: A Zoophytographic Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" aims to explore how the Amazonian environment is represented in cultural productions, such as texts, cinema, and art. Our research hypothesis posits that these productions highlight the dynamic interplay between non-human beings and human cultural life. We propose to develop the concept of zoophytography, which refers to the inscription of animals and plants in cultural works, thereby decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making.\n\nThis project consists of three research streams: (1) Amazonian Zoophytography, which will formulate a definition of zoophytography and trace its roots to Indigenous, riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy; (2) Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out, which will focus on the articulation of animals in cultural productions; and (3) Flora's Voice: Phytographic Conversations, which will examine plant inscription in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nOur contributions will include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, the revelation of interdependence between humans and non-humans, and the drawing of attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia. Furthermore, this project will uncover more equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants, thereby advancing environmental humanities, Amazonian perspectives on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies."
