        "**Title:** Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project explores the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestinians between 1880 and 1920, a period marked by European imperialism, Ottoman state building, and globalization. Through a comparative analysis of social practices across the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond, this study seeks to identify the strategies employed by late Ottoman Palestinians to confront challenges on both individual and collective levels. Using census data as a primary source, we will examine how these individuals and communities coped with challenges and mobilized to achieve their goals.\n\nThis project aims to contribute to the field of global social and cultural history, develop a theoretical framework for understanding social dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine, and establish methodological standards for historical geographic information systems (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire. By shedding light on the colonial experiences of late Ottoman Palestinians under British Mandate, this study will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex social and cultural dynamics of this period and its legacies."
