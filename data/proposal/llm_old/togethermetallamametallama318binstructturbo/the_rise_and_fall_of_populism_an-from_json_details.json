        "**Title:** The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism: An Empirical Investigation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex factors driving the rise and fall of populism and extremism. Through a multi-faceted empirical approach, we will investigate how personal experiences, information environment, and aggregate economic shocks influence political decisions. The proposed research consists of three interconnected components:\n\n1. We will examine the impact of personal employment histories and information environment on voting behavior, using a database of over 40 million resumes (2010-2016) and zipcode-level economic and voting variables.\n2. The second part of the project will investigate the influence of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and populist agenda support, leveraging archival records on corporal punishment regulations in UK schools (1970-80s) and data on contemporary educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting.\n3. Finally, we will explore the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, utilizing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda (WWII Germany).\n\nThis research will provide new insights into the drivers of populism and extremism, shedding light on the complex interplay between personal experiences, information environment, and aggregate economic shocks. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of these phenomena, with implications for policy and practice."
