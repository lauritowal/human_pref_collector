        "**Title:** Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600: A Comparative Analysis of State Formation and Decentralization\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to challenge prevailing assumptions about the centralized nature of state formation in Western Europe during the 14th to 16th centuries. By examining the complex dynamics of lordship, power, and representation in five key regions (Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire), this project aims to develop a nuanced understanding of the decentralized nature of state authority during this period.\n\nDrawing on a path-dependency analytical framework, this research will investigate the interplay between state formation, urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent. The project will challenge the traditional top-down view of state formation by princes and instead explore the role of representation and bottom-up processes in shaping the development of lordship and state authority.\n\nMethodologically innovative, this research will integrate quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex power dynamics at play during this period. By exploring the boundaries between Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, this project will shed new light on the social history of power and contribute to a deeper understanding of the rise of states in Western Europe."
