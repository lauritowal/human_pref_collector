        "**Title:** South American Population History Revisited: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the Upper Amazon\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project proposes a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary investigation into the evolution of linguistic diversity in the Upper Amazon, a region in western South America characterized by a complex, layered socio-historical past. By integrating geographical, socio-historical, and communicative approaches, this research aims to reconstruct and compare past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade. The study will focus on the Upper Amazon, an area of extreme linguistic diversity with signs of local language contact, representing old diversity patterns, and dominated by three language families indicating different stages of expansion.\n\nThis research has the potential to uncover crucial insights into the interaction between ecology, human behavior, and cognition. By analyzing linguistic diversity, we can reveal past events and understand the dynamics that shaped the social and cultural landscapes of the region. The findings of this project will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex history of the Upper Amazon and contribute to the broader field of population history research in South America."
