        "**Title:** The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse in Europe through the analysis of eviction litigation cases. Using data science techniques, we aim to examine the influence of international human rights law on national court decisions and identify predictor variables that contribute to these outcomes. Our research will utilize a legal big data approach, combining citation network analysis and machine learning methods to analyze a dataset of eviction cases from national supreme and lower-level courts in Europe, spanning the period 2007-2011.\n\nThe proposed project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the interplay between international and national law, shedding light on the impact of the international right to housing on national court decisions. Our findings will not only inform future research in this area but also have practical implications for policymakers and legal professionals seeking to promote and protect the right to housing. By leveraging data-driven analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to produce a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between international human rights law, national legal discourse, and eviction litigation."
