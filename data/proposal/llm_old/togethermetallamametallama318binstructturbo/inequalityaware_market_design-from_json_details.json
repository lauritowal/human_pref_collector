        "**Title:** Inequality-aware Market Design: An Innovative Approach to Redesigning Marketplaces with Inequalities\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the optimal design of marketplaces that account for inequalities, a critical aspect often overlooked in conventional market design. Our project, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), aims to develop a novel theoretical framework to address the challenges posed by economic inequalities in market settings. Using a mechanism-design approach, we will investigate how policymakers can introduce rules constraining transactions and distribute scarce resources without markets, as exemplified by policy interventions such as rent control, healthcare, and public transit.\n\nOur research will focus on maximizing welfare with redistributive preferences, taking into account private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights of participants. We hypothesize that, in the presence of detectable inequalities, policymakers may need to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable surplus split. The potential outcomes of our research include a deeper understanding of inefficient rationing and the development of policy guidance on distortionary market interventions.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute to the theoretical framework of market design by addressing inequality concerns, distinguishing it from traditional focus on efficiency and revenue. The complementary approach of public-finance through tax systems will also be explored. Our research has the potential to inform policy decisions and provide a more equitable market design framework."
