        "**Title:** From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to conduct a socio-historical study of the transition from post-World War II international public health to the current global health regime. The study will examine the shift in knowledge and action in post-World War II health governance, focusing on specific areas such as tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics. Employing historical and anthropological investigation types, the project will explore changing roles of the World Health Organization (WHO), developments in non-Western countries, particularly India, and the transition from a Cold War to a neo-liberal and multi-centric age.\n\nThe expected benefits of this project include a more nuanced understanding of global health as translated in and emerging from local practices and knowledge, the inclusion of social worlds such as laboratories, hospitals, and international organizations, and an exploration of different levels of circulation beyond North-South transfers. This research has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics shaping global health governance today."
