        "**Grant Proposal: Cultural Roots and Institutional Transformations of Teachers' Careers and the Teaching Profession in Europe**\n\nThis systematic comparative research project aims to understand the complex factors influencing teachers' careers and the teaching profession in Europe. The study focuses on Belgium, France, and England, three countries experiencing low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages in their educational systems.\n\nBy combining post-comparative mixed-methods design, policy analysis, and multilevel multi-group analyses, this project will investigate the institutional dimensions affecting teachers' careers and the profession. The research objectives include explaining the nature of teacher policy, understanding the status change of the teaching profession, analyzing teacher allocation, and modeling and predicting teacher attrition and migration.\n\nThe proposed research will contribute new theoretical knowledge and reconceptualize the understanding of institutional change, informing policy decisions to address the challenges faced by the teaching profession in Europe. The project's findings will provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers, ultimately improving the attractiveness and sustainability of the teaching profession in Europe."
