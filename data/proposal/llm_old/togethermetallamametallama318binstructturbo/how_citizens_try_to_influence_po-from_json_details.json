        "**Title:** How Citizens Try to Influence Politics and Why: International Comparisons of Movement and Party Politics\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposed project aims to advance our understanding of citizens' engagement in politics, exploring the complexities of contentious and non-contentious politics in various democratic societies. The project employs a multi-method approach, combining meta-analysis, global survey data comparisons, focus group discussions, and experimental surveys to investigate the dynamics underlying individuals' participation or apathy in politics.\n\nThrough an international comparison of eight countries (the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina), this project seeks to identify causes of different modes of political participation and explore the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal factors. The findings will contribute to the development of a unified theoretical and methodological framework for understanding contentious and non-contentious politics, providing valuable insights for policymakers and scholars alike. The project is expected to shed new light on the complexities of democratic societies and the ways in which citizens attempt to influence politics."
