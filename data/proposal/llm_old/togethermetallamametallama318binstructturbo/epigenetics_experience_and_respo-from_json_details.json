        "Title: Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for Neurodevelopmental Disorders\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders,\" aims to investigate the intersection of epigenetics, ethics, and neurodevelopmental disorders. We seek to shed light on the complex interplay between epigenetic factors, social and physical environments, and the development of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches, this project will examine the implications of epigenetics for our understanding of innate vs. acquired traits, genetic vs. environmental influences, and biological vs. psychosocial factors. Our research will also consider the capacity and normative responsibility of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families, engaging with key stakeholders to inform our findings.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between epigenetics, experience, and neurodevelopmental disorders, with far-reaching implications for diagnosis, treatment, and support."
