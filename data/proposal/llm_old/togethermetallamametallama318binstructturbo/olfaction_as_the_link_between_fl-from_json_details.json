        "**Title:** OLFLINK: Deciphering the Olfactory Link between Flavor Preference Formation and Retrieval during Food Consumption\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled OLFLINK, aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption, with a primary focus on the role of olfaction. By investigating the processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth, we seek to uncover the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (CODE), the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations (CONTROL), and the interactions with digestive feedback that regulate coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (REGULATE).\n\nThis research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns and inform the development of novel interventions for dietary changes over the life course. Ultimately, OLFLINK aims to provide insights that can facilitate the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, promoting global health and sustainability."
