        "**Title:** Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of technology on corporations, investors, and individuals. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the shift to virtual-only shareholder meetings on communication between firms and shareholders, as well as the relationship between firms' stated and actual environmental, social, and governance (ESG) actions. Additionally, we will examine the relationship between employees' characteristics, including gender, and their Economic Benefits of Capital (EBC) in the tech industry. Our study utilizes a mixed-methods approach, combining natural language processing with qualitative analysis. Preliminary findings suggest that the shift to virtual-only meetings has minimized communication opportunities and allowed firms to strategically avoid addressing shareholder questions, while market rewards firms for stating ESG actions rather than taking actual actions. This project aims to provide insights into the effects of technology on corporate governance, ESG practices, and employee welfare, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the complex relationships between firms, investors, and individuals."
