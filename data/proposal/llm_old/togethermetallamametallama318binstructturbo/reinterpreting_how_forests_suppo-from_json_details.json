        "**Title:** Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nMalnutrition affects over 2 billion people worldwide, with low-income countries disproportionately affected by nutrient deficiencies. While agricultural production and access to calories have been primary solutions, the role of forests in supporting dietary quality has been overlooked. This project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality in low-income countries.\n\nOur multi-scale, multi-country approach will employ a data-rich methodology to explore the complex relationships between forests, household food consumption, and dietary outcomes. We will identify hotspots where forest loss and fragmentation have significant effects on dietary quality, and conduct in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to develop a framework on forest-diet linkages, providing empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality. Our findings will contribute to a paradigm shift in food security conceptualization, highlighting the critical role of forests in supporting the dietary needs of vulnerable populations. This project has the potential to inform sustainable development policies and practices that prioritize forest conservation and dietary diversification in low-income countries."
