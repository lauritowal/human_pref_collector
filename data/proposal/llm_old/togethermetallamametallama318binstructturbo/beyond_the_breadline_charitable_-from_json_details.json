        "**Title:** Beyond the Breadline: Charitable Food Provision and Survival Strategies of the Urban Poor in a Comparative Perspective\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project aims to investigate the role of charitable food provision (CFP) in mitigating food insecurity among the urban poor in diverse institutional settings. By charting the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, and examining CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, this study seeks to fill significant research gaps in the field. The project will employ event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography to investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support, as well as the professionalized CFP sectors and their relationships with state and non-state authorities.\n\nThis comparative study will introduce a novel tool for real-time data collection in city workshops, enabling the examination of CFP as part of poor people's survival strategies. The project's anticipated impact is to create new knowledge across multiple studies, offering comparative insight into food support and insecurity. Ultimately, the research will contribute to the development of an overarching framework for CFP comparison, extending its applicability to other countries and cities."
