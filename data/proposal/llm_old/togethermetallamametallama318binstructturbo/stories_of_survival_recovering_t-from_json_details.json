        "**Title:** Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis transnational research project, Stories of Survival, seeks to uncover the dispersed histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world (1500-1750). Tracing the migrations of Eastern Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas, this project aims to bridge the gap between micro-scale everyday experiences and macro-narratives in global history. By analyzing philology and source criticism, our team will engage with diverse source materials, including documents from multiple continents, languages, and archives.\n\nOur research team, comprising multiple researchers under the supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI), will employ a global and connected histories approach to reconstruct the complex histories of Eastern Christians. Key project outcomes include the publication of scholarly works, the organization of workshops, and the development of a searchable database. By shedding light on the untold stories of Eastern Christianity, this project will contribute significantly to the fields of Middle Eastern history, European history, and global history, ultimately enriching our understanding of the early modern world."
