        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive, interdisciplinary research project that aims to investigate the cultural significance of play and games in Classical Antiquity. Spanning two time periods, from the emergence of the Greek city-states (c. 800 BCE) to the fall of the Roman Empire (c. 500 CE), this study will explore the multifaceted aspects of play and games across various social strata, including free men, slaves, men, women, adults, children, and even gods. The proposed research will examine play and games within diverse environments, such as urban and rural settings, and draw upon a range of source materials, including written texts, archaeological findings, and iconographic representations.\n\nThis project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological perspectives to understand the complex dynamics of play and games in Classical Antiquity. The study's findings will contribute to our understanding of ancient cultures, shedding light on the social, educational, and cultural contexts in which play and games were practiced. The proposed research will also have implications for modern fields, such as gender studies and education studies, which will be explored through the development of training models, research models, school materials, museum exhibits, and library resources."
