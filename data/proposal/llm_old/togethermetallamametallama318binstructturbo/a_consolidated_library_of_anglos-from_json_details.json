        "**Title:** A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry: Unveiling the Vernacular and Latin Traditions of Medieval England\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to establish an online, interactive library of Anglo-Saxon poetry, encompassing the centuries of c. 670-1100 CE. The proposed library will consolidate and markup all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse in TEI P5 XML, totaling 60,000 lines of poetry. The corpus will include both the works of named poets (50) and anonymous verse, with a focus on documenting the influence of named poets and tracing potential influences across the vernacular and Latin traditions.\n\nThe project will provide a comprehensive, multilingual corpus of 30,000 lines of Old English and 30,000 lines of Anglo-Latin poetry, often preserved in manuscript witnesses. The library will be accompanied by digital resources, including sound-files and image-files, facilitating a deeper understanding of the poetic heritage. Through conferences, workshops, and a planned publication series, this project will significantly contribute to the research on the geographical scope of Europe, particularly the Latin and vernacular co-existence in a Christian context. The proposed library will become a valuable resource for scholars, students, and the broader public, offering a unique window into the rich cultural and linguistic landscape of medieval England."
