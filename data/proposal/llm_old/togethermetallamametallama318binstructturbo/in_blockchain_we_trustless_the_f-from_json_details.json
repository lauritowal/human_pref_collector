        "**Title:** In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the BlockchainGov project, a groundbreaking research initiative that explores the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures. By combining the expertise of computer scientists, political scientists, and legal scholars, our project will investigate the power dynamics, legitimacy, and sustainability of existing blockchain systems, as well as their potential for enabling decentralized decision-making.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of power dynamics, legitimacy, and sustainability, our research aims to provide empirical and theoretical contributions to the field of distributed governance. We will also experiment with new governance models at various levels, from community to global, and examine their potential for supporting decentralized decision-making.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the opening of a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing policy implications for global governance, and offering innovative solutions for more sustainable and legitimate governance systems. To achieve these outcomes, we require a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team, and multidisciplinary skills.\n\nThis project has the potential to transform our understanding of governance and decision-making in the digital age, and we believe that it deserves funding to explore its full potential."
