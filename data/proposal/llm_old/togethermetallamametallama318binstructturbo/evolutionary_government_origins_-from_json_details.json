        "**Title:** Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nWe propose the STATE-DNA project to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of government structures and their impact on policy outcomes. This five-year research endeavor aims to answer two primary questions: Why do government structures change, and how does structural change affect government policy? Building upon the evolutionary government theory, we will analyze a comprehensive dataset of government structures from 1815 to 2025, ascertaining the interplay between unit-level features and environmental contexts. Our innovative approach employs genetic measures to assess structural change and data assimilation techniques from biology to systematically analyze the effects of structural change on government policy. The expected outcomes of this project include a rich dataset of government structures, an in-depth analysis of structural change's impact on policy, and predictive forecasting of future structural changes. By contributing to the understanding of government evolution, this research has significant implications for policy-making, institutional design, and the study of democratic governance."
