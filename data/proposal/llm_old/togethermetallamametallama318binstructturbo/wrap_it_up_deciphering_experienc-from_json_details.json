        "**Title:** Wrap It Up: Deciphering Experience-Dependent Myelin Growth Across Development\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, WRAPPED, aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying human learning and development by investigating experience-dependent myelin growth across the lifespan. Using a two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data, our team will assess changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. We will probe the entire developmental lifespan, evaluating changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults acquire novel skills such as juggling and reading Chinese.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory and establish a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, including schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. This research will utilize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology to investigate myelin growth in the living human brain. The findings of this study will have significant implications for our understanding of human development and learning, and may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for disorders associated with myelin alterations."
