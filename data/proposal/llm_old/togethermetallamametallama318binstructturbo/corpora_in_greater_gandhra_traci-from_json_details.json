        "**Title:** Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the development of Buddhist textuality in the Greater Gandhāra region of the first millennium of the Common Era. Through a comprehensive analysis of Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts, this project aims to uncover the textual and material production processes, transmission networks, and relationships between textual and material artifacts in the region. By applying philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, we will examine the textuality of Indic language materials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India, including recent discoveries from the Mes Aynak archeological site and a private collection in Thailand.\n\nThe proposed research will yield a rich corpus of digitalized texts, an akṣara database, and comprehensive digital preservation and preservation protocols. Additionally, the project will produce critical editions and translations of the manuscripts, offering new insights into the transmission and diffusion of Buddhist thought in the region. The study will also provide a comparative analysis of textual and material features across languages, shedding light on the complex networks of textual and material production in ancient Gandhāra."
