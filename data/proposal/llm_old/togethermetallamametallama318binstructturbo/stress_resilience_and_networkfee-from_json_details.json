        "**Title:** Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training: A Novel Framework for Understanding and Enhancing Stress Adaptation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of brain adaptation to acute stress and to identify effective methods for training stress resilience. Our research objectives are to (1) characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during acute stress and recovery, (2) identify neural markers predicting resilience to stress using wearable biosensors and mobile apps, (3) cross-validate these markers in a high stress sensitivity patient group, (4) examine the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts, and (5) develop functional MRI neurofeedback for training adaptive reallocation of neural resources.\n\nOur proposed research uses a multi-modal approach, incorporating network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback to investigate large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition. We hypothesize that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale networks, and that these shifts can be leveraged to develop novel training methods for enhancing stress resilience. The outcome of this research will provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of stress adaptation and will contribute to the development of effective interventions for promoting mental health and well-being."
