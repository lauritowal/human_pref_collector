        "**Title:** Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project investigates the lasting impact of authoritarian regimes on the norms and ideological preferences of citizens in new democracies. By examining the complex relationships between voters' avoidance of past ideologies, party competition, and national identity, we aim to develop a comprehensive theory explaining political competition heterogeneity across new democracies. Through a combination of survey experiments and theoretical contributions, this project will shed light on key issues such as voters' ideological preferences, perceptions of party stances, and the supply of new parties in post-authoritarian contexts. We will focus on case studies in Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, exploring the decline of left-wing parties, the delayed emergence of radical right parties, and the higher likelihood of right-wing protests. Our expected outputs include a new theory explaining the ideological legacy of dictatorships and its implications for party competition in new democracies."
