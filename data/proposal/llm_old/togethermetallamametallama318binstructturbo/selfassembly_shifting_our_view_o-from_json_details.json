        "**Title: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, Assembling Life, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by developing a novel theoretical framework based on self-assembly processes. Departing from the conventional view of life as energy-dependent and genetically regulated systems, we propose to explore the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structures without external guidance. By intersecting insights from nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and the philosophy of science, we aim to:\n\n1. Develop a new understanding of genetic causation, where genes are seen as \"nudgers\" rather than determinants of life.\n2. Establish a new theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes, enabling a deeper comprehension of life's underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are profound, shifting our understanding of life in both science and philosophy, and providing conceptual tools to inform the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences. By exploring the self-assembly paradigm, we have the opportunity to redefine the boundaries of life and shed new light on its fundamental nature."
