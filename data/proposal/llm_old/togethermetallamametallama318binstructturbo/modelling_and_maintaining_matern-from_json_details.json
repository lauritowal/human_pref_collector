        "**Title:** Modelling and Maintaining Maternal Mental Health (HealthyMom Project)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed HealthyMom Project aims to elucidate the complex relationships between pregnancy loss, brain anatomy, function, and mental health in women. Our objectives are to study the traces of unwanted terminated pregnancies in the female brain, understand the reversal of motherhood-associated changes in brain anatomy and function after pregnancy loss, and identify determinants of afflicted mental health post-pregnancy loss.\n\nUsing a longitudinal design, we will acquire repeated brain imaging and hormonal assessments, as well as comprehensive mental health monitoring, following early miscarriage or stillbirth. Additionally, we will perform whole genome sequencing of women and their life partners and utilize detailed surveys to correlate findings. We will employ multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry to uncover relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors for mental health maintenance.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to provide novel insights into female-specific brain dynamics, reveal neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability, and identify targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The implications of this research will have significant impacts on women's health, with indirect effects on the health of future offspring. This grant proposal seeks to support the innovative research methods and advanced computational techniques necessary to achieve these goals."
