        "**Title:** What are the Origins of Empathy? A Comparative Developmental Investigation\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the developmental origins of empathy in humans and bonobos, providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary and biological underpinnings of this complex social behavior. By leveraging a unique comparative approach, we will combine longitudinal observations, innovative experiments, and cutting-edge techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking to study empathy development in both species.\n\nOur research goals are to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, advance understanding of empathy origins, and challenge prevailing perspectives about human uniqueness in empathy. We hypothesize that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but that humans diverge in motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states and have a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange.\n\nThis interdisciplinary investigation integrates biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, offering a novel perspective on the evolution of human social behavior. By exploring the shared and divergent aspects of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our research will provide a profound understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying social cooperation and sharing."
