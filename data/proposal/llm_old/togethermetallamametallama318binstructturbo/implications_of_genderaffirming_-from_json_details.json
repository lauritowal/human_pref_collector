        "**Title:** Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships of Transgender People\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to investigate the implications of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on the psychosocial functioning and social relationships of transgender people. Given the high rates of social disruption and suicide risk in this population, it is essential to understand the causal pathways linking GAHT to improved psychosocial outcomes.\n\nOur research will employ a biopsychosocial model, utilizing novel and cutting-edge research methods across four work packages. We will isolate the causal pathways linking GAHT to psychosocial functioning, empower transgender people to voice their personal and relational experiences, and guide policy and practice for gender identity services.\n\nBy focusing on improvement of psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes, our research will position itself at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare. An informed consent model will be used to ensure the rights and autonomy of participants are respected.\n\nThis study has the potential to inform evidence-based practice, improve health outcomes, and promote social acceptance of transgender individuals. We anticipate that the findings will contribute significantly to the existing literature on transgender health and inform policy and practice recommendations for healthcare providers."
