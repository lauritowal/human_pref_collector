        "**Title:** The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage: A Norms-Based Approach to Understanding Inequity in the UNFCCC (CCLAD Project)\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nClimate change has reached a critical juncture, with the need for urgent action to address its consequences increasingly acknowledged. However, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has struggled to develop consensus on loss and damage policies, reflecting deep-seated issues of justice and equity. This research project, titled CCLAD, seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining the politics of climate change loss and damage through an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic methodology.\n\nBy investigating the normative frameworks that underpin the UNFCCC's policy areas, including disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration, this project aims to provide new insights into the conditions that facilitate norm hegemony, influence, contestation, or reversal. Through the application of micro-politics of international negotiations and domestic policy practices comparative research, CCLAD will make methodological contributions to political ethnography and develop practice-tracing methods to better understand the complex dynamics of norm-content fluidity.\n\nUltimately, this research aims to inform policy-making and provide a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities for addressing climate change consequences in a just and equitable manner."
