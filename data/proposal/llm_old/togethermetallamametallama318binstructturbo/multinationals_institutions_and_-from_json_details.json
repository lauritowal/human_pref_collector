        "**Title:** Multinationals, Institutions and Innovation in Europe: Understanding the Territorial Impacts of Multinational Enterprises\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to investigate the location strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their territorial impacts in Europe. Despite contributing over a quarter of global GDP, valued at over US$16 trillion, MNEs' spatial dynamics and institutional relationships remain understudied. Our research aims to address these knowledge gaps by analyzing the interactions between MNEs, institutions, and innovation in European regions. We will examine the changing patterns of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows from developing economies, which increased from 16% to 31% of global outflows between 2007 and 2012.\n\nThis study will provide policymakers with valuable insights into the territorial impacts of MNEs and inform evidence-based decisions on promoting innovation and development in European regions. Our research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of FDI data with qualitative case studies of MNE investments in European countries. The expected outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between MNEs, institutions, and innovation in Europe, ultimately shaping policy-making tools for regional development."
