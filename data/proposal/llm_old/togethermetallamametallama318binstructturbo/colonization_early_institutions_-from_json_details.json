        "**Abstract:**\n\nTitle: Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization\n\nWe propose a research project that explores the origins of state capacity, democracy, and the emergence of political dynasties in colonial Latin America. By examining the initial years of Spanish colonization, this study aims to shed light on the formative period of state development in the region. Our research subject is the Spanish colonization of Latin America, which offers a unique experimental context for understanding the impact of colonial conquest on the evolution of state capacity and democratization.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods approach, combining case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables, we will analyze the rules governing early institutions and the location of initial settlements at the subnational level. Specifically, we will draw on primary sources from the Capitulaciones and Archivo de Indias to document the colonial power dynamics and institutional settings in the initial years of colonization. This project will make a significant contribution to the field of comparative politics by providing new insights into the origins of state capacity and the emergence of democratic institutions in Latin America. The findings of this study will have important implications for our understanding of the long-term consequences of colonial conquest on state development and democratization."
