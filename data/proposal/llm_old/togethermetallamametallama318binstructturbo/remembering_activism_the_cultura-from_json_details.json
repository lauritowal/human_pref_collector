        "**Title:** Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\" project seeks to provide a comprehensive and in-depth account of the remembering and forgetting of activism in Europe since the late 19th century. This research aims to reveal continuities and changes in the depiction of protest across different media regimes, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying memory of protest, and show how this memory feeds back into later movements.\n\nThe project will focus on three study periods: 1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012, and will employ a multi-faceted approach, including network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references. This innovative design will enable the development of new analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope and provide critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity.\n\nThe project's findings are expected to have significant implications, including a major reorientation in cultural memory research, the development of new analytic tools, and the opening up of a new area of social movement research. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of cultural memory and its role in shaping social movements and collective identity."
