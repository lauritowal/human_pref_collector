        "**Title:** Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support the development and documentation of a groundbreaking transcultural musical practice, integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. Through a series of research workshops, performance training, and collaborative projects in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, this project aims to bridge the cultural divide between Eastern and Western musical traditions.\n\nKey objectives include training traditional instrumentalists and singers in new repertoire, developing innovative approaches to modelling music's impacts on musicians and audiences, and creating ensemble interfaces with newly designed instruments. The project will also produce studies on timbre and establish a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nExpected outputs include an e-book, an orchestration manual, and online audio and visual examples, which will be published by Cambridge University Press (CUP). This project has the potential to become a model for transcultural musical practice and overcoming cultural barriers, contributing significantly to the advancement of musicology and the promotion of intercultural understanding."
