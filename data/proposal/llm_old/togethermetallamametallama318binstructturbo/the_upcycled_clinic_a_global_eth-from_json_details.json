        "**Title:** The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents a comprehensive ethnographic project, \"The Upcycled Clinic,\" aimed at exploring the phenomenon of material creativity in contemporary medicine. The project focuses on the wastefulness prevalent in medical settings and seeks to identify conditions that facilitate creative material engagement among healthcare workers. Through a multi-site approach, with five sub-projects conducted in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., we will examine the ways in which healthcare staff, including ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff, repurpose materials in their daily work.\n\nUtilizing a combination of fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets, this project will move hospital ethnographies beyond the focus on patient encounters and contribute to the development of new methods for reusing and sharing research material. The project's implications include advancing theories of materiality and addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. By articulating conditions for healthcare creativity and local solutions to wastefulness and shortages, \"The Upcycled Clinic\" will provide valuable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and efficient healthcare system."
