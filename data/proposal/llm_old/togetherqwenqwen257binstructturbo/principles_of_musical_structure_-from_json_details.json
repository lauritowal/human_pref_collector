        "Title: Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\n\nThis proposal seeks to advance our understanding of human cognition by focusing on the complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. We aim to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that surpasses the limitations of current approaches, which are mostly confined to harmonic syntax and share the expressive power of tree-based context-free grammars. The project will consist of three strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental. The theoretical strand will focus on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints to develop a theory of musical syntax with greater expressive power. The computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses using a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars. The experimental strand will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. This project will contribute significantly to both music cognition and cognitive sciences, providing new insights into how humans perceive and process complex auditory information."
