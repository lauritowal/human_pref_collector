        "This grant proposal, titled \"Solidarity in the European Union,\" seeks to develop and apply a comprehensive normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1). The project aims to address key issues within the EU, including free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession processes (EUSOL2). By providing a normative account of solidarity within the European context, this research will enhance our understanding of how solidarity can be effectively fostered and maintained among member states, contributing to more cohesive and resilient EU governance."
