        "Title: Pregnancy and the Human Brain: A Window of Neuroplasticity\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks to comprehensively investigate the profound changes in human brain structure and function that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The project aims to map these changes, identify key factors driving pregnancy-related neuroplasticity, and explore the neural substrates underlying adaptive and maladaptive processes. Focusing on critical areas such as maternal caregiving, mental health disorders, and memory issues, this prospective cohort study will track women from before conception through the postpartum period. Utilizing cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, psychopedagogic measures, and biomedical assessments, the study will provide a detailed understanding of the neurobiological journey to motherhood. These findings will lay a foundation for the emerging field of human neuroscience and offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between pregnancy, neuroplasticity, and maternal well-being. The outcomes of this project have the potential to significantly advance our knowledge and inform future interventions for maternal health and neurodevelopment."
