        "Title: Biomarkers of Individual Differences in Human Cortical Visual Processing\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to deepen our understanding of how vision is influenced by both physiological state and personality traits. By integrating ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the human visual cortex, psychophysical measures, and pupil responses, we aim to explore the co-variation between behavioral and cortical properties with personality traits in normally sighted individuals, including young children. The innovative approach of combining visual processing measures with physiological interventions, such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity, promises to provide new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception. We predict that these interventions will lead to evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolic states. This work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, particularly aiding in the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders, and encouraging therapeutic approaches that consider general physiological state. By filling the existing gap in knowledge about why normally sighted individuals perceive differently, this project will contribute valuable insights into the complex interplay between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception."
