        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Between Canon and Coincidence: Using Data-Driven Approaches to Understand Art Worlds\" (BECACO), aims to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections from Indigenous Latin America through large-scale socio-politico-historical analysis. The project will leverage quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining to explore a vast corpus of provenance data spanning from 1850 to 2000. By focusing on 12 museums across nine countries in Europe, the study will introduce \"Art World Patterns,\" a concept originally introduced by Howard Becker in 1982, to new audiences. This project seeks to develop new models for provenance research and advance both conceptual and methodological approaches to understanding the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in European collections. The outcomes will significantly enhance our knowledge of historical translocations of cultural material and their socio-political contexts."
