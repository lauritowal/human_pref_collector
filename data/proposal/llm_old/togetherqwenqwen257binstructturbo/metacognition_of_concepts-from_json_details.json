        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Metacognition of Concepts\" (MetCogCon), aims to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying the use of concepts, a fundamental aspect of human cognition. The importance of concepts in reasoning and decision-making processes is well-established, yet the metacognitive factors that influence their acceptance and rejection remain poorly understood. This project will focus on key concepts such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, exploring how metacognitive processes affect decision-making and reasoning.\n\nMetCogCon will employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind with psychological model-building and experimental investigation. By developing a clear theoretical framework, the project seeks to enhance our understanding of cognitive control processes and address significant philosophical problems. The research has the potential to inform reasoning policies in both everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and to determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection. Expected outcomes include a deeper insight into a fundamental aspect of the human mind, contributing to both cognitive science and philosophy."
