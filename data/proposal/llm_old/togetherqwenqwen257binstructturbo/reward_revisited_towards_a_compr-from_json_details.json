        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition,\" seeks to develop a novel, unifying conceptual and neural framework delineating how reward shapes cognitive operations. The project aims to extend our understanding of reward effects by integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. By employing optimized neuroimaging methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), the study will elucidate the role of dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems in these processes. This research has significant implications for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research, offering insights into the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind. Additionally, the study will explore how disturbances in DA and NA systems, as observed in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, affect motivational influences on cognition. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of these conditions and potentially inform therapeutic interventions."
