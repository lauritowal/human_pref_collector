        "Title: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials (WAGE)\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal outlines a research project entitled \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\" (WAGE), aimed at theorizing the gendered nature of collective bargaining. The project, drawing on data from the United Nations (2022) and Eurostat (2022), which reveal a global gender pay gap of 20% and a European average of 13%, will focus on Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Through ethnographic research, the study will compare and synthesize the histories of collective bargaining and gender pay gaps in these countries, while also examining daily practices in collective bargaining rounds within the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. The research aims to document and explain how actors in these sectors relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. This project seeks to uncover the mechanisms underlying wage formation and inequality, contributing to a deeper understanding of why gendered wage differentials persist despite collective bargaining efforts."
