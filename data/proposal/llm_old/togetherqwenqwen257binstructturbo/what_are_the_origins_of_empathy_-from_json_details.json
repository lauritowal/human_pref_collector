        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the origins of empathy through a pioneering comparative developmental investigation between humans and bonobos. The project aims to identify the developmental and evolutionary roots of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in this trait, and advance our understanding of its origins. Using a combination of longitudinal observations, innovative experiments, and cutting-edge techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, the study will investigate empathy development in humans from Vanuatu and Samoa, and in wild and semi-captive bonobos. By challenging traditional perspectives on human uniqueness in empathy, the research will contribute to interdisciplinary fields including biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology. The core hypothesis posits that humans and bonobos share a fundamental capacity for empathy, diverging in motivation to alleviate others' emotional states, and humans possessing a unique capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. This project has the potential to reveal human-unique sharing and cooperation behaviors, providing profound insights into our evolutionary history and societal structures, particularly those involving distributed-caregiving."
