        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal outlines the establishment of \"The Swedish Historical Database Project,\" aimed at compiling and making publicly accessible highly detailed, yearly data spanning from 1749 to 1952 for approximately 2500 Swedish administrative districts. The project encompasses a broad range of data content, including economic activities, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structures, education, social statistics, agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments, creating a comprehensive and continuous series of reliable population data. This unique, locally detailed dataset offers unprecedented opportunities for empirical research on economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development, employing advanced econometric techniques such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation. Building on previous work in this field, the project aims to significantly enhance our understanding of long-term economic processes and provide a robust foundation for future research on economic development and growth."
