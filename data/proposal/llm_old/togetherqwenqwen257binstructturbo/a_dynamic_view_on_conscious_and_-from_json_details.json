        "Title: A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\n\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive investigation into the distinguishing mechanisms of conscious and unconscious processes, fundamental to understanding human cognition. Utilizing a combination of behavioral and brain imaging methods, the project will explore three distinct tracks. Track 1 focuses on unconscious perception through the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli using Gaze-Contingent Substitution. Track 2 delves into conscious perception by employing a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents. Track 3 investigates the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants through psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG. These tools aim to uncover the development of consciousness through the maturation of specific brain regions. Expected outcomes include evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, a specification of cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions, and new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. This project seeks to advance our understanding of cognitive processes and contribute significantly to the field of cognitive neuroscience."
