        "Title: How Nature Affects Cooperation in Common Pool Resource Systems\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the intricate interplay between natural systems and human cooperation in managing common pool resources. The project aims to identify under which natural preconditions and social settings sustainable use of renewable resources is most likely to occur. By focusing on three continents, we will employ both theoretical and statistical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which nature shapes economic agents' preferences and incentives in managing shared resources. Specifically, we will investigate how tipping points and thresholds in the natural system (Mechanism A), the volatility of resource abundance (Mechanism B), and the interaction between leadership and the natural environment (Mechanism C) affect cooperation and resource management. Our findings will contribute to the fields of economics and sustainability science, offering valuable insights into the design of effective policies and community-based management strategies. This research is crucial for understanding and promoting sustainable resource use in an era of environmental change and increasing human pressures on natural systems."
