        "Title: STARTDIALOG - Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams, a crucial yet underexplored aspect of logical geometry, with applications spanning philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of the logical properties and heuristic potential of these diagrams has hindered their full utilization. Our research strategy involves a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and the creation of a comprehensive database to address these issues. Expected outcomes include clarifying current debates, providing an accurate understanding of the methodological importance of these diagrams, and treating them as independent objects of study. This project aims to achieve a breakthrough in the field, contribute to philosophical logics, and foster interdisciplinary applications, thereby enhancing our theoretical and practical understanding of Aristotelian diagrams."
