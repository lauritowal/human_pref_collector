        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, BACKWARD (Biological Adaptation and Phylogenetic Reconstruction With Advanced Palaeoproteomics and Diversified Applications), aims to advance our understanding of human history and adaptation through the development and deployment of cutting-edge palaeoproteomic workflows. This initiative will utilize advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions to address critical questions in hominin phylogeny, particularly focusing on South African early hominins and hominid diversity in Southeast Asia. The project seeks to reconstruct evolutionary histories for species extinct millions of years ago, with a focus on identifying and correlating processes related to human brain expansion and reorganization, and species and sex identification from fossil fragments. BACKWARD will also explore commercial applications in forensic medicine, the food industry, and pharmaceuticals, leveraging a strong partnership among participating institutions. This transformative project is expected to build upon the revolutionary impact of ancient DNA (aDNA) studies, offering unprecedented insights into our evolutionary past and potentially paving new pathways in diverse sectors."
