    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive model of power delegation to international organizations (IOs) through a comparative, longitudinal analysis from 1986 to 2010. The project will explore how various IOs, including the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO, have steadily extended their authority over time. By examining factors such as temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design, the research will incorporate a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach, enriching theoretical and empirical insights in International Relations. The study will adopt qualitative methods, including archival research and elite interviews with national and international officials, and aims to test hypotheses and build theory in political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. This project will provide critical insights into the consequences of power delegation to IOs and contribute to advancing research in the field."
