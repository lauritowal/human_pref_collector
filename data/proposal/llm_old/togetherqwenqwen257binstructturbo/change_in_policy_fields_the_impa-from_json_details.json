    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the evolution of morality policies in 25 OECD countries from 1980 to 2010, focusing on life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances. The project aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on policy changes by comparing international and domestic factors, and developing explanations for observed patterns. Utilizing both macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies, the research will analyze legislative output data, with case selection based on critical findings from the quantitative phase. The study will cover three policy subfields: abortion, euthanasia, prostitution, pornography, homosexuality, and addictive substances. This research will contribute to our understanding of how morality policies adapt to societal changes across diverse national contexts."
