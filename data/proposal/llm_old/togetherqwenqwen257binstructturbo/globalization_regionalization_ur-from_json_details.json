        "Title: \"Globalization, Regionalization, Urbanization: An Analysis of the World's Maritime Network from 1734 to the Present\"\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to map the changing spatial patterns of the world economy over 300 years through a comprehensive analysis of maritime transport networks. Leveraging the Lloyd's List register, the project will map maritime flows and analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network, employing graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks. Key goals include creating dynamic and interactive visualizations accessible via a geomatics platform, and conducting comparative analysis with general network models to track the evolution of network expansion, shrinkage, concentration, and polarization. The study will also explore the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development, integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics. This interdisciplinary research aims to provide a detailed understanding of how maritime networks have shaped the global economy and urban landscapes over the past three centuries."
