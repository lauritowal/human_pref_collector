        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the project PRINCIPLES: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation. Addressing global challenges such as global warming and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, PRINCIPLES seeks to develop a unified science of human cooperation. Current models often focus on a single aspect, limiting their effectiveness in understanding complex cooperative behaviors. PRINCIPLES aims to overcome this limitation by integrating insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to create a comprehensive model of rule following and cooperation. Through experimentally tested frameworks, PRINCIPLES will conduct incentivized experiments on representative samples to investigate the behavioral links between cooperation principles and analyze models of social dilemmas. The project focuses on climate care as a target problem, providing researchers and policy makers with the tools and data necessary to address large-scale cooperation issues. PRINCIPLES aspires to equip a diverse audience with a robust interdisciplinary approach to understanding and promoting collective action."
