        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking Function for Prediction\" (MADVIS), aims to elucidate the impact of visual deprivation at various developmental stages on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. By studying the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight recovery, MADVIS will employ interdisciplinary methods from cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology to advance our understanding of experience-dependent brain region adaptation. The project's objectives include predicting outcomes of sight restoration procedures. Expected impacts encompass advancing knowledge on brain plasticity, bridging crossmodal reorganization with sight recovery, and developing new predictive tools for sensory restoration, thereby significantly contributing to the field."
