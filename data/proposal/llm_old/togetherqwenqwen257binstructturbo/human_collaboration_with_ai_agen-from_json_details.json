        "This grant proposal outlines a multi-sited ethnography to explore the complex interplay between human collaboration and AI in national health governance. The project, titled \"Human Collaboration with AI Agents in National Health Governance: Organizational Circumstances Under Which Data Analysts and Medical Experts Follow or Deviate from AI,\" aims to analyze when and how data analysts and medical experts intervene in or follow AI recommendations in big data/AI-informed health governance. This research will be conducted in six diverse national settings, employing innovative anthropological methods such as future-scenarioing to connect empirical insights with AI development. The study seeks to fill gaps in our understanding of the socio-cultural context and organizational factors influencing ethical AI practices. By developing a theory on these organizational dynamics, the project aims to provide actionable insights for national health policies and individual lives, thereby enhancing the ethical dimensions of AI in health governance."
