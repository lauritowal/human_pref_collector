        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Good Attention: Attention Norms and Their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics\" (Project Acronym: GOODATTENTION), seeks to provide a comprehensive philosophical investigation of attention norms, integrating them across multiple disciplines. This interdisciplinary research, grounded in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and other fields, aims to understand the emergence of attention norms within individual and social contexts, and to evaluate these norms within a normative philosophical framework. The primary hypothesis posits that the fundamental norms of attention are concerned with relevance. Through a series of research activities, including investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social norms in guiding attention, and analyzing the epistemic and ethical dimensions of attention, this project will develop a unified foundation for the study of attention norms. Expected impacts include enriching philosophical fields by integrating attention norms, providing an analytical framework for policy-making, and advancing our understanding of how individuals and societies prioritize information."
