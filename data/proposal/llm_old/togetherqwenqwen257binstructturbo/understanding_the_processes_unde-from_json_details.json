    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop and apply a novel mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework to understand the complex processes underlying societal threats such as climate, politics, and vaccination. The proposed project addresses key methodological challenges in social science research, including the unobservability of constructs, varying underlying processes across diverse groups, and measurement inequivalence. By clustering groups with common processes and employing flexible measurement models to account for non-invariance, our approach will provide a robust method for analyzing large-scale survey data on beliefs, values, perceived threats, and risk perception. The research will specifically explore how these factors influence societal threats, considering examples such as the diverse drivers of climate change beliefs in different countries. Utilizing freely available software, this project aims to enhance the field's ability to draw accurate and meaningful conclusions from complex social data, ultimately contributing to more effective societal responses to emerging threats."
