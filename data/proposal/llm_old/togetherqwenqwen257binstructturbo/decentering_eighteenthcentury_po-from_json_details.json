        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a project titled \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire.\" The project aims to reassess the early history of European political economy by focusing on practical measures and policies for betterment and improvement in the eighteenth century, rather than converting historical arguments into modern economic models. The Swedish Empire serves as the primary case study, with a comparative analysis of other cases to enhance broad applicability. Key concepts such as improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare will be explored within discursive production sites including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The hypothesis posits that activities in each site were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project seeks to advance our understanding of eighteenth-century political economy and its relevance to contemporary debates on societal improvement and economic development."
