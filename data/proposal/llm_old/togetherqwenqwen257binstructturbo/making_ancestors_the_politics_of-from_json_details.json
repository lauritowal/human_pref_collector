        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the research project titled \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe,\" which seeks to re-evaluate the traditional understanding of inequality and politics in prehistoric Europe. The project challenges prevailing views by proposing that inequality manifested situationally rather than overtly, focusing on the Neolithic, Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age periods in Peninsular Italy. Utilizing osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, the project aims to analyze 200 individuals per period, providing empirical evidence to assess how inequality influenced lives and the role of ancestors in society. By testing alternative models of prehistoric inequality and death practices, this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of social dynamics and cultural evolution in prehistoric Europe."
