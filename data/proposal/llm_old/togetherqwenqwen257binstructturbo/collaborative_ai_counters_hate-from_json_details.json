        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the project \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" (AI4Dignity), aimed at developing innovative solutions to address the challenges of AI-assisted extreme speech moderation, specifically focusing on online hate speech and disinformation. Addressing key issues such as the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training datasets, and the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural contextualization, the project will implement a collaborative, bottom-up approach involving global comparative frameworks, community-based classification, and partnerships between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries. The primary goals include improving AI-assisted speech moderation, developing an open-access toolkit, setting procedural benchmarks, operationalizing the 'human in the loop' principle, and creating inclusive training datasets. This project promises to significantly enhance the effectiveness and ethical standards of AI moderation systems, contributing to a safer and more inclusive digital environment."
