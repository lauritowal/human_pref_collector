        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Beyond the Genetics of Addiction,\" aims to elucidate the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors contributing to substance use disorders, focusing on nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and caffeine. Utilizing advanced extended twin family designs and state-of-the-art DNA-variant, RNA, and biomarker analyses, the study will leverage the extensive longitudinal phenotype database and biological samples from the Netherlands Twin Register. Our research team, with over two decades of experience in data collection, coordination, and analysis, particularly in the fields of behavior genetics and addiction research, is uniquely positioned to conduct this critical investigation. The objectives include identifying and confirming key genes and gene networks, exploring gene expression patterns, and investigating biomarkers to understand how genetic and environmental factors influence substance use and related health outcomes. With a large sample size and the commitment to additional data collection, this project will provide novel insights into the genetic architecture of addiction, enhancing our understanding and potentially informing targeted interventions."
