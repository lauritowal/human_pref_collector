        "This grant proposal aims to develop an evidence-based model for big data policing by integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions. The project, titled \"Towards an evidence-based model for big data policing: Evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological, and legal and ethical conditions,\" addresses the fragmented expertise and lack of interdisciplinary studies in this field in Europe. Utilizing variables such as previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to the nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity, the project seeks to evaluate the predictive reliability and effectiveness of big data policing models. Through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles, the project aims to fill significant knowledge gaps and contribute to the development of transparent and ethical big data policing strategies. This innovative approach distinguishes itself by focusing on legal and ethical standards, offering a robust model that aligns with scientific rigor and societal values."
