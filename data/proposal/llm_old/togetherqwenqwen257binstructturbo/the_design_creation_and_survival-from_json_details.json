        "The grant proposal seeks funding for the DEMOLAW project, which aims to analyze the design, creation, and long-term survival of democratic legislation in the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. This project will employ cutting-edge computational methods to address three critical research questions: which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law, why the design of democratic legislation varies across political systems, and how laws change or remain stable over time. The project's objectives include developing a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design, creating an integrated theoretical framework for understanding legislation creation and survival, and advancing methodological approaches for computational analysis of legislative content. By focusing on legislative texts from these three distinct political systems, DEMOLAW will contribute significantly to our understanding of democratic lawmaking processes and their evolution. This research will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of legislative design and survival, thereby enhancing our comprehension of democratic governance."
