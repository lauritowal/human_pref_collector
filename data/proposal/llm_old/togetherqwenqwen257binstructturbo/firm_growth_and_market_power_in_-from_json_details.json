        "Title: Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal, titled \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy,\" aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power in developing economies, with the goal of informing welfare and policy decisions in a globalized world. Drawing on the framework established by EC 2007, our research will explore how trade and competition policies can ensure that consumers benefit from globalization, especially when firms engaged in international trade possess significant market power. We will also investigate the impact of domestic policies on agribusiness firms and their effect on small farmers, as well as the role of industrial policies in fostering firm growth through input linkages. Additionally, we will examine the influence of banking globalization on the growth of real sector firms. Over a five-year period, our project will incorporate richer firms' behaviors into models of international trade and integrate theoretical work with extensive data from developing economies. The expected outcomes include expanding the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy and providing a robust basis for informed policymaking."
