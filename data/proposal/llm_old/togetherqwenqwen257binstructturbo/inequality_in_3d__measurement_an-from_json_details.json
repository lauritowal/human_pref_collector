        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Inequality in 3D – Measurement and Implications for Macroeconomic Theory,\" aims to advance our understanding of inequality and its macroeconomic impacts. The project seeks to measure the economy at the micro level, focusing on three dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth, using novel microdata. By applying heterogeneous agent models and contrasting them with traditional representative agent models, we will quantify micro heterogeneity that significantly influences macroeconomic theory. Expected outcomes include informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models, providing novel insights for the improvement of fiscal and monetary policy tools, enhancing the debate on economic inequality, and offering lessons to policymakers. This study will explore the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy, contributing to more accurate and effective economic policies."
