        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to \"Rediscover the Hidden Structure: A New Appreciation of Juristic Texts and Patterns of Thought in Late Antiquity,\" aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Roman legal culture in this pivotal period. The project will focus on the persistence of a high-level legal culture, the manuscript transmission of legal texts, the roles of classical jurists, and the motivations behind emperors' legislation. Through a multidisciplinary research team comprising three experts, the project will engage in the editing of a collection of papyri and parchments, host workshops with European scholars, and organize an international conference. Key outputs will include a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference. This project will contribute to a deeper appreciation of the legal and intellectual landscape of Late Antiquity, bridging the gap between textual analysis and historical context."
