        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South,\" aims to explore the complex interplay between religion and security in urban settings. The project focuses on mega-cities in the Global South where state agencies lack capacity to provide infrastructure and security, leading to the emergence of religious vigilantes. Through an ethnographic comparison of Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, this research will analyze why residents grant authority to religious vigilantes and how religion legitimizes these practices. Key research questions include the role of religion in alternative governance and the production of authority among vigilantes. The project employs an ethnographic methodology to draw general conclusions about the intersection of religion and power in these contexts. By extending the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, this study aims to contribute to policies aimed at improving human security in mega-cities."
