        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability\" (RICA), seeks to reconceptualize critical assumptions about the regulatory state. By exploring the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, and developing a new theoretical framework for understanding accountability, RICA aims to address the rise of non-majoritarianism and the devaluation of political processes. Utilizing insights from political science literature on reputation, RICA will investigate how reputation shapes accountability behaviors. The project will consist of two modules: (1) examining the adverse impact of insulation on regulatory credibility, and (2) exploring how reputation influences accountability. This research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability, offering new perspectives on the normative and institutional design principles of the regulatory state."
