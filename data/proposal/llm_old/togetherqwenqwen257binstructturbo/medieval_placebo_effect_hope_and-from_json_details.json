        "Title: MedPlaceboEffect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal, titled \"MedPlaceboEffect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500,\" seeks to explore the placebo effect in medieval medicine, focusing on Southern Europe from 1100 to 1500. The project aims to identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect, including hope, expectation for cure, belief, and trust, through a triangular approach examining ideas, practices, and organizing structures. The core concepts of hope, expectation, belief, and trust are central to understanding the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing during this period. The goal is to demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities and their impact on health systems, providing a foundation for contemporary examination of healing practices.\n\nThis research will engage in a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions, contributing to a deeper understanding of therapy elements in medieval healing and the soul/mind impact on health. The project addresses challenges such as distrust in modern medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, by offering insights into the historical context of these phenomena. The findings will not only enrich our understanding of medieval medicine but also provide valuable perspectives for the development and effectiveness of modern healthcare practices. This interdisciplinary project promises to bridge historical and contemporary research, offering a unique contribution to the fields of medical history, psychology, and healthcare studies."
