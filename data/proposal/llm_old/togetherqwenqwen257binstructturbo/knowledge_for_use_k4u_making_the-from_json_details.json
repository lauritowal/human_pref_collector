        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, entitled \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies,\" seeks funding under the Horizon 2020 program to advance the field of social science by developing a new approach to enhance the use of social science in policy-making. The project aims to address the current emphasis on knowledge production while neglecting knowledge use by reconceptualizing the role of objectivity and deliberation, and integrating values into the science-society interface. Utilizing a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U will focus on developing practical insights for policy design and deliberation, ensuring a balanced consideration of effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. The project aims to contribute to the philosophy of social technology by providing intelligible and practical guidance for policy-makers and other stakeholders. By launching this field, K4U will offer a comprehensive framework to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies, ultimately leading to more effective and socially acceptable policy outcomes."
