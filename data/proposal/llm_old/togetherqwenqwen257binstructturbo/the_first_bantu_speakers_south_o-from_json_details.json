        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, titled \"The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa,\" aims to elucidate the timing, location, and dynamics of the Bantu expansion through a comprehensive, collaborative effort involving archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics. The project focuses on understanding the earliest Bantu-speaking village communities in Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, spanning from 3000 to 1000 BCE. Key research areas include the archaeological signature of early villagers, interactions with hunter-gatherers, and subsistence patterns, supported by archaeobotanical, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data. The linguistic approach involves lexical reconstruction, particularly focusing on subsistence and land use. This project integrates multiple disciplines to provide a holistic view of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming. Fieldwork will be conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola, with collaboration across interuniversities to address open questions and controversies surrounding the Bantu expansion. The use of phylogenetic modelling will enhance our understanding of these complex processes."
