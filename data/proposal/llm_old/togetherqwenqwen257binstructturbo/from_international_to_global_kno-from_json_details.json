        "This grant proposal, titled \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health,\" aims to explore the transition between two regimes of knowledge and action in post-World War II health governance. The project focuses on tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics, utilizing a socio-historical and anthropological approach. It investigates the changing roles of the World Health Organization and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. The study will analyze the shift from international public health, characterized by eradication efforts and UN-led initiatives, to global health, marked by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public partnerships. This research seeks to include various social worlds such as laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. By approaching global health as translated in and emerging from local practices and knowledge, the project aims to understand the transition from a Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal, multi-centric age of uncertainty. Expected benefits include a deeper understanding of different levels of circulation beyond traditional North-South transfers, contributing to a more comprehensive view of global health dynamics."
