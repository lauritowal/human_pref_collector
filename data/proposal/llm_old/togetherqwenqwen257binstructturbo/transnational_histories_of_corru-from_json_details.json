        "The proposal, titled \"Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850),\" seeks to construct a history of the idea of 'corruption' within the context of Central-South-East Europe during the period of 1750 to 1850. This project aims to explore the multifaceted nature of corruption, including graft, nepotism, and bribery, by examining how both foreign observers and indigenous critics perceived and interpreted these practices. The study will analyze the motivations behind these behaviors—political, professional, and personal—and assess their perceived impacts on the creation of more honest and efficient administrations, more effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations. By linking these practices to cultural backwardness and economic underdevelopment, the project will reframe debates on patronage and graft, and trace the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption. The academic contributions include a dialogue with global modernization, aligning historiography with scientific innovations, and reconfiguring center-periphery relations. This research promises to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex historical dynamics of corruption in the region, contributing significantly to the broader discourse on modernization and global history."
