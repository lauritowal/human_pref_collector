        "Title: Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government (STATE-DNA)\n\nAbstract: This grant seeks to explore the evolutionary dynamics of government structures and their impact on policy through the lens of the newly developed theory of \"Evolutionary Government.\" The project, titled STATE-DNA, aims to comprehensively study structural changes in government units within ministries and agencies, spanning from 1815 to 2025. Leveraging genetic measures to assess structural change and data assimilation techniques from biology, the study will analyze a dataset of 150,000 units across 6 countries. Key research questions focus on understanding why and how government structures change and the consequential effects on policy. Hypotheses suggest that structural changes are driven by interactions between units and their environment, and that these changes evolve as an outcome managed by distinct governmental units. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive historical dataset of government structures, a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on policy, and predictive forecasting models for future structural changes. STATE-DNA will provide valuable insights into the adaptability and evolution of governmental systems, enhancing our understanding of political and administrative dynamics."
