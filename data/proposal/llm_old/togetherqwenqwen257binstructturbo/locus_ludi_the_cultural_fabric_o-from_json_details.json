        "Abstract:\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, titled \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity,\" seeks to provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence of play and games in the Greek and Roman worlds from c. 800 BCE to c. 500 CE. The project aims to explore the diverse participants, including free men, slaves, men, women, children, and even gods, across various environments such as towns and rural areas. By utilizing a range of source types, including written, archaeological, and iconographic materials, this study will employ multiple foci such as linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological approaches. The investigation will also delve into the intersection of gender studies and education studies, offering new insights into the social, cultural, and educational significance of play and games in antiquity.\n\nThe project will produce a variety of outputs, including training and research models, school materials, museum exhibits, and library resources. These resources will serve as valuable tools for educators, researchers, and the general public, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the role of play and games in the cultural fabric of classical antiquity. Through this project, we aim to bridge academic disciplines and enhance public engagement with the rich heritage of ancient Greek and Roman play and games."
