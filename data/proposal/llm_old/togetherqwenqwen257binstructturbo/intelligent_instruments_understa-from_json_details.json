        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) through the innovative lens of music, aiming to bridge the gap between technology and humanities. The project, titled \"Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies,\" is an interdisciplinary endeavor led by an academic team with expertise in music, philosophy, and computer science. The core of the project focuses on developing instruments integrated with creative AI, exploring human-AI collaboration in music, and utilizing these sonic instruments as scientific tools. This research will initiate public discourse on the role of creative AI in society and culture and develop a theoretical framework for its impact on human relationships and self-perception.\n\nThrough a research collaboration protocol that involves diverse scientific disciplines, the project will explore how creative AI transforms our notions of art, culture, and society, and what ethical principles should govern AI design in future products and services. By leveraging music as a platform to foster public engagement with AI, this project aims to not only advance theoretical understanding but also contribute to the development of human-centered AI. The outcomes of this project will provide valuable insights into the role of AI in embodied technologies and reflect on the future societal implications of artificial intelligence."
