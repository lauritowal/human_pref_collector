        "Abstract: This grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and their improvement, with implications for both individual well-being and societal health. The project aims to address key research questions regarding the origin, control, and modulation of impulsive actions, as well as their functional and dysfunctional manifestations. Utilizing a multifaceted approach, including behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS and EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, this proposal seeks to develop detailed multifaceted models that replace current inhibitory control models. Objectives include specifying the origins and control of impulsive actions, explaining impulsivity and control across time and space, developing a new behavioral model of impulsive action, understanding individual differences in impulsivity, and elucidating disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of impulse control and inform the development of effective interventions."
