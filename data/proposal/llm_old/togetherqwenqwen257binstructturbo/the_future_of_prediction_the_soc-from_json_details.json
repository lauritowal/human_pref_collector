        "**Abstract**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support the research project titled \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine, and Policing.\" The project aims to investigate the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and its implications for social institutions within the domains of social sciences, insurance, medicine, and policing. Focusing on big data, machine learning, and digital forecasting, the research will explore key areas such as personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing. The project addresses critical challenges including the individualization of prediction, the undermining of the mutualization principle, and the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods. It also delves into the problem of bias and the distinction between prevention and repression. The goal is to understand how these advanced predictive methods affect societal structures and individual rights, contributing to the development of more equitable and effective social policies. This interdisciplinary study will provide valuable insights into the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of algorithmic prediction in critical sectors of society."
