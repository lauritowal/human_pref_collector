        "The proposed project, titled \"Mapping Emerging Gender Artivism in the Mediterranean Arab Public Space\" (MEGAMAPS), aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region through a transnational in-depth study of artivist movements for gender equality post-2011. Focusing on Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, MEGAMAPS employs methodologies such as history, social movements theory, gender studies, visual arts, and digital humanities to investigate the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change. The project's objectives include documenting and systematizing living sources, producing an open-access participative digital platform, and enhancing activists' participation in transnational networks. MEGAMAPS will conduct fieldwork and digital ethnography, focusing on visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, and maps. The digital platform will be designed to be FAIR and accessible to academics, stakeholders, and the general public, promoting mutual exchanges of best practices and contributing to a reversal of victimization paradigms on women and sexual minorities."
