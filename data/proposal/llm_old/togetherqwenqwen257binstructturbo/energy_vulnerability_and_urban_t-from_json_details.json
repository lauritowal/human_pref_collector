        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address the critical issue of energy vulnerability in post-socialist cities across Eastern and Central Europe through the project \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe.\" The project will investigate the multifaceted social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty, affecting millions of households in regions such as Eastern and Central Europe, through a comparative study of case studies in Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. By employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, the project aims to explore key causes including energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, income differentials, economic, and political restructuring. The study will transcend current conceptual limitations by incorporating a broader range of factors such as social inclusivity, community resilience, and regional economic dynamics. The ultimate goal is to transform technical and institutional frameworks, provide affordable energy services, and contribute to climate change mitigation. This project will significantly enhance our understanding of energy poverty and inform sustainable policies and interventions for urban transitions in the region."
