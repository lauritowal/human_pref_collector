        "Title: Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the theory of decentralized trade under conditions of informational asymmetries and limited commitment. In most trading scenarios, parties possess unequal information, leading to market inefficiencies. This project aims to address these limitations by conducting a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries, focusing on non-durable and durable divisible goods. The objectives include understanding the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms, exploring remedies for enhancing efficiency, contributing to market institution design, and informing market regulation. The project will examine the professional investor-individual dynamic in financial markets and the consumer's willingness-to-pay scenario. By addressing the shortcomings of standard mechanism design theory, this research aims to provide valuable insights into improving market efficiency and guiding regulatory policy."
