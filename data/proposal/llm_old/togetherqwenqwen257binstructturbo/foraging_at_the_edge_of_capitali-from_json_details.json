        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism,\" seeks to develop a comprehensive political ecology of foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy in the context of the Anthropocene, particularly post-2008 financial crisis and amidst the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. This interdisciplinary project, grounded in anthropology, is led by an international team of five researchers based at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich. Drawing on case studies such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US, the project aims to understand the diverse and often overlooked foraging practices that have gained increased global relevance.\n\nThe research initiative is driven by the objective of exploring the political, economic, and environmental dimensions of foraging, aiming to fill a gap in mainstream attention to these practices. Over the course of the project, we plan to produce a series of academic outputs including two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a documentary film, and an exhibition. These outputs will contribute to both academic discourse and public understanding, highlighting the critical role of foraging in contemporary socio-environmental contexts. By situating foraging within the broader landscape of economic strategies and environmental challenges, this project seeks to provide new insights and policy frameworks for sustainable resource management in the 21st century."
