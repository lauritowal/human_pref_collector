        "The proposed project, \"POLYCHROME: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics,\" aims to assess the risk and preservation status of culturally significant painted, gilded, and Christian images from wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. This study focuses on the transformation of these objects from religious devotion to cultural heritage, examining the impacts of historical events such as the break with the church in Rome in 1527 (Sweden) and 1537 (Denmark-Norway). The project hypothesis posits that many damages are linked to iconoclastic acts, challenging existing assumptions about damage origins. With a methodology grounded in natural science technologies, the POLYCHROME project will analyze c. 150 polychromed objects, collect material data, map restorations, and establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism and an influence on training priorities in heritage conservation. This project seeks to fill a critical research gap by providing a comprehensive analytical overview and fostering debates on heritage values and future care strategies."
