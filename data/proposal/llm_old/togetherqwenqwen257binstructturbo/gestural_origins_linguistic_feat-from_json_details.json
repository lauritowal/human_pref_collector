        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the research project \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of Pan-African Ape Communication,\" designed to investigate the systematic meaningful communication in great ape gestures and its relevance to understanding the evolution of human language. The primary objectives include examining cultural variation in ape gestures across species, physical environments, and social interactions; determining the impact of combining signals on gesture meaning; and comparing human and ape gesture use and comprehension among adults and children. The study will employ a comprehensive, Pan-African approach involving 17 ape and 9 human groups, incorporating species-specific, environmental, and social factors in gesture acquisition and use. Methodologically, the project will analyze signal combinations and their role in constructing meaning in ape communication, and compare these findings with human language patterns. This research addresses fundamental questions about human language evolution, particularly focusing on social learning and syntactic structure in ape communication, thereby contributing to our broader understanding of the evolutionary continuum between humans and apes."
