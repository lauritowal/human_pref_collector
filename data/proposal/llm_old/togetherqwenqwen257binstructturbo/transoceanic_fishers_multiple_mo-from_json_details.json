        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea,\" seeks to explore the complex dynamics of transoceanic fishers from China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. The project challenges the assumption that fishers are mere instruments of state agendas by focusing on their shifting roles as poachers, traders, smugglers, and legitimate harvesters. Utilizing a theoretical framework of relational and shifting multiple mobilities, combined with a methodological framework and fine-grained ethnography, the study aims to analyze the impact of growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood on transoceanic networks. Key nodal points include shore-based activities and the adoption of radical marine harvesting techniques. This research will provide a thalassographic analysis of these fishers' movements and practices, contributing scientific and policy values. TransOcean's innovative approach offers a unique perspective on transnational maritime interactions and will generate insights critical for sustainable marine resource management and policy-making."
