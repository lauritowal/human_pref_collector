        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Advantages and Pitfalls of Elicited Online User Engagement,\" aims to investigate the effects of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites, both from a business and societal perspective. The project will adopt an empirical approach, including lab and field experiments, to understand the mechanisms behind user engagement and its elicitation, the direct business value of user engagement, and the societal implications of user engagement expectations. Preliminary results indicate strong effects of calls to action on conversion and information revelation. We will collaborate with a leading website-development service provider, a freemium model company, to ensure practical relevance. The anticipated impact includes a deeper economic and societal understanding of social computing, which will contribute to the development of more effective and responsible online engagement strategies."
