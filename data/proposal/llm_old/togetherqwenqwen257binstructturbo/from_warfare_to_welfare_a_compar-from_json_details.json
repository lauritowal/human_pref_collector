        "This grant proposal, titled \"From Warfare to Welfare: A Comparative Study of How Combat Trauma is Internalized and Institutionalized,\" seeks to explore the complex ways combat trauma is both experienced and institutionalized in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. The project, an interdisciplinary endeavor blending anthropological, clinical, and policy analysis approaches, will employ ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, and discourse analysis. The primary objective is to develop a comparative framework that illuminates how combat trauma shapes societal and institutional values, particularly within military and psychiatric contexts. By shedding light on the internalization of war-related suffering and the conflicting values surrounding it, this study aims to identify key problems in veteran care and influence policy and healthcare practices. The research will also advance understanding of biopolitics and medicalization, contributing to a nuanced portrayal of veterans' experiences with ethnicity and resistance to clinical illness models. Expected outcomes include enhancing the care of veterans and clinicians, and fostering academic discourse on the broader implications of combat trauma institutionalization."
