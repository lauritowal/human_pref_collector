        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal presents a novel approach to enhance Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies, aiming to develop a next-generation BIM system that incorporates not only physical and material characteristics but also form, function, and user context. Current BIM tools inadequately represent buildings, focusing solely on physical aspects such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, and ignore the intended use and user experience. As a result, these tools fail to predict a building's impact on future users and whether it meets the needs of its intended occupants. \n\nOur research aims to address these limitations by developing a comprehensive modeling method that integrates form, function, and user context into building models. This advancement will significantly improve the design process, ensuring that buildings are better tailored to user needs and behaviors, leading to enhanced environmental sustainability and user satisfaction. By including user behavior and contextual factors in BIM, we can better predict how users will interact with and experience the built environment, thereby optimizing design outcomes. Given the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth, this research holds the potential to make a substantial contribution to sustainable development and urban planning. This proposal argues for the development of advanced BIM systems that support the evaluation of human behavior in built environments, ultimately leading to better-designed, more user-friendly, and more sustainable buildings."
