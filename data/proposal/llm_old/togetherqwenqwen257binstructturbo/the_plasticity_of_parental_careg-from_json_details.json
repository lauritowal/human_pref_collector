        "Title: The Plasticity of Parental Caregiving: Characterizing Brain Mechanisms Underlying Normal and Disrupted Development of Parenting\n\nThis proposal aims to investigate the brain mechanisms associated with the normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents. The project is structured into three subprojects. The first subproject will conduct a longitudinal study to examine structural and functional brain changes in both women and men from the pre-pregnancy period to the first year postpartum, using behavioural measures on caregiving tasks. The second subproject will employ a cross-sectional design to study the impact of disruptions such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities (cleft lip and palate) on brain and behavioural effects on caregiving. The third subproject will synthesize findings using advanced computational models to identify fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. This research will provide critical insights into the neural underpinnings of parental caregiving, which can inform interventions for parents experiencing difficulties and contribute to the broader understanding of brain plasticity in the context of parenting."
