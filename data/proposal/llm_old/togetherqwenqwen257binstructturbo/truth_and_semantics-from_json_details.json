        "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Truth and Semantics,\" aims to advance our understanding of natural language semantics by integrating truth-conditional semantics and the study of semantic paradoxes. The project seeks to develop comprehensive semantic accounts for key aspects of natural language, including modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals, informed by the notion of truth. It also explores the foundational role of truth in the semantics of natural languages from a metasemantic perspective. By addressing the challenges of \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics,\" this research will achieve a unified framework that combines traditional and contemporary approaches. The outcome will be the first systematic study to examine the intersection of truth and natural language semantics from a comprehensive, interdisciplinary viewpoint, contributing significantly to both linguistic theory and philosophical logic."
