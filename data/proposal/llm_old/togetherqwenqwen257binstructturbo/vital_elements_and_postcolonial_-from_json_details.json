        "Title: **Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town**\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal seeks funding for a research initiative centered on Zarzis, Tunisiaâ€”a Mediterranean harbour town, to explore the end of lives through a unique lens of forensics as the art of paying attention. The project, titled \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves,\" will map unliveable life conditions in Zarzis by investigating key resources crucial for life: phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. By adopting a decolonial shift in focus from Europe to Africa, our research team aims to develop forensics as a method for ethnographic study, marking an innovative approach to understanding the complex interrelations of vital elements in this context. The project will involve site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists to create the Vital Elements Atelier. This initiative not only advances the vital elements concept but also contributes to the broader discourse on postcolonial moves, offering a critical perspective on global resource exploitation and its socio-environmental impacts."
