        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the adaptation of cereals to new environments in Europe, specifically focusing on barley and wheat, to better understand the spread and adoption of agriculture as the primary subsistence strategy. The project aims to assess the influence of environmental pressures on crop domestication and the subsequent establishment of farming. Through a multifaceted approach, including population genomics, ecological modeling, ancient DNA sequencing, and the use of computer methods for temporal analysis, we will identify loci under selection in the barley and wheat genomes. This will be correlated with ecogeographical variables, dated to reveal periods of adaptation, and synthesized with archaeological and demographic data. Our work will provide critical insights into the Neolithic transition, balancing the often-overlooked human and environmental dimensions of domestication. By correcting the imbalance in current understanding, this project will offer new perspectives on Neolithic population dynamics and crop productivity, contributing significantly to our knowledge of early agricultural societies in Europe."
