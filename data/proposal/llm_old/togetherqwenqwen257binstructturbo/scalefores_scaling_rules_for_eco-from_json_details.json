        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping,\" aims to develop and test a novel methodological framework for mapping the relationships between various ecosystem services using existing data, focusing on Europe, a region with robust data on ecosystem services. The primary objective is to address the challenge of reliably mapping these relationships, thereby enabling multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. The project will examine the scale-dependency of these relationships with regard to social and ecological variables such as land cover, soil type, and human population density. Key methods include creating detailed maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. To validate the methodology, the project will compare these maps with existing ecosystem service maps in Europe. Anticipated outcomes include accurate maps of ecosystem service relationships and enhanced ability to map the distributions of these services, contributing significantly to sustainable landscape management globally."
