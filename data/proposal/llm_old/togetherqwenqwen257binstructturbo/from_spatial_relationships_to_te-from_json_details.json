        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding,\" aims to elucidate the role of gamma waves (30-80 Hz) in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity within the visual cortex. The project integrates deep-learning networks for prediction with multi-areal recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to develop a novel method for quantifying predictions and prediction errors in natural vision. The study will focus on marmosets and humans, testing the hypothesis that gamma waves synchronize to match predictions and sensory inputs, rather than simply carrying prediction errors. Using optogenetics, we will manipulate gamma waves to investigate their dependence on experience and perceptual learning. Key conditions such as neurological and psychiatric disorders are also addressed. We expect to demonstrate that V1 gamma waves are dependent on top-down feedback, providing evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. This research will advance our understanding of predictive coding and its neural underpinnings."
