        "This grant proposal seeks to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by examining the contributions of local actors in the co-construction of welfare systems, particularly in border regions such as Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German border areas, from the 1870s to the 1990s. The project employs a comparative and transnational approach to analyze the interaction between public and private actors and the influence of national and non-national identities on social provision. It aims to explore how these regions experienced inclusion and exclusion in welfare, the competition in social provision, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders. By tracing these dynamics, the research will inform contemporary debates on welfare reform and address social rights issues in Europe, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between local and global forces in shaping social policies and practices."
