        "Title: ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop and validate a novel scale for assessing active ageing, encompassing dimensions of ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy, based on the World Health Organization's definition. The project will examine determinants and modifiers of active ageing, focusing on resilience and external support. A multicomponent sustainable intervention will be developed and tested for feasibility and effectiveness in promoting active ageing. The intervention will employ counseling, information technology, and volunteer assistance. Data will be collected through a cross-sectional sample of 1000 participants aged 75, 80, and 85, and compared with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago. Statistical methods will include state-of-the-art techniques to analyze cohort effects and pathway to active ageing. A randomized controlled trial involving 200 participants will further test the intervention's effectiveness. This project aims to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing, produce evidence for its promotion, and train young scientists. Expected benefits include the development of a new scale for active ageing, new concepts and theory, and enhanced understanding of how to support older adults to maintain their active lifestyles."
