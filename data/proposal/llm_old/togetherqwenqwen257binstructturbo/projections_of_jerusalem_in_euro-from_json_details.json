        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network,\" a comprehensive project aimed at documenting, studying, and conceptualizing the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through hundreds of monuments scattered across Europe. The project, which encompasses an initial focus on documentation and surveying, will evolve into rich avenues of research, including new insights, comparative studies, and conceptualizations of Jerusalem. The study will delve into the iconography, mapping, and network of these monuments, with a particular emphasis on their role as interactive multimedia spaces that embody the complex layers of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, and mnemonic practices.\n\nThrough meticulous field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and the grouping of monuments into meaningful clusters, the project will crystallize the shared and unique narratives these sites convey. Collaborative methods, including discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, will facilitate interdisciplinary engagement and deepen our understanding of this multifaceted cultural and religious phenomenon. Throughout the research process, various outputs will be produced, culminating in a comprehensive book that encapsulates the project's findings and contributions to the fields of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, and devotionalism. This project not only aims to enrich our understanding of Jerusalem's global presence but also to foster dialogue and collaboration among scholars, institutions, and communities."
