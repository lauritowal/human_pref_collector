        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations,\" aims to deepen our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and its implications for monetary policy. The project will focus on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, which are designed to distinguish between 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' agents, thereby providing a richer framework for analyzing economic dynamics. \n\nOur objectives include the development of a framework to discern between constrained and unconstrained agents and conducting a comparative analysis of HANK models with Two Agent New Keynesian (TANK) and Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models. The analysis will specifically examine the heterogeneity wedge in consumption and investment, aiming to understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates in both theoretical models and actual economies. \n\nThe comparative analysis will focus on aggregate equilibrium dynamics across HANK, TANK, and RANK models, with the goal of identifying the unique insights offered by HANK models. The proposed applications include exploring the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on the design of optimal monetary policy. This research will provide critical insights into how heterogeneity influences economic outcomes and how policymakers can better address these differences in their strategies."
