        "Title: In Blockchain We Trust (Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal seeks to explore the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the realm of governance. The project, named BlockchainGov, aims to investigate the current governance dynamics of existing blockchain systems and analyze the power structures, legitimacy, and sustainability within these decentralized environments. By delving into the intersection of computer science, political science, and law, the research team will examine the feasibility and implications of new distributed governance models at both community and global levels. Through empirical studies and theoretical analyses, BlockchainGov aims to open a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing significant contributions to scientific understanding and policy implications for global governance. This high-risk/high-gain initiative requires a dedicated and motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills, committed to pushing the boundaries of current knowledge and fostering innovative solutions in the evolving landscape of digital governance."
