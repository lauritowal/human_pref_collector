        "Abstract:\n\nTIME (Towards a dynamic account of natural vision) proposes a groundbreaking interdisciplinary project aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of higher-level vision in ecologically valid conditions. The project seeks to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain, integrating information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. Leveraging non-invasive human brain imaging, multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modeling, TIME will explore vision as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process by visualizing and analyzing tens of thousands of rich, human-annotated natural scenes. Novel multivariate analysis techniques and a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision will be developed. This approach promises a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision, offering new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions. The project aims to bridge the gap between biological and synthetic vision, fostering closer alignment and advancing the field of neuroscience and artificial intelligence."
