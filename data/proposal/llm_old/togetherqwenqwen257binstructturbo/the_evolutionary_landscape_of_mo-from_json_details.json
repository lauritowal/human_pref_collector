        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"NGIPALAJEM: The evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa,\" seeks to establish major empirical benchmarks to elucidate key questions regarding the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. This research, centered in Turkana, aims to add new specimens to the hominin fossil record and increase the large vertebrate fossil record. The project will employ novel morphometric and analytical techniques to conduct inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses. Our focus is on the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas, particularly during the Middle Pleistocene. Through fieldwork over the last million years, we aim to identify small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins, contributing to a better understanding of phenotypic diversity. The research spans a critical timeframe, from 750,000 years ago to the end of the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT), characterized by greater climatic variability and a prolonged arid phase, which significantly impacted the large mammal community. The expected outcomes include a new understanding of human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape, providing crucial insights into the climatic and ecological factors that shaped modern human origins."
