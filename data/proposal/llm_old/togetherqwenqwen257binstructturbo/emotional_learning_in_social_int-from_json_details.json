        "Title: Emotional Learning in Social Interaction\n\nThis grant proposal aims to deepen our understanding of emotional learning processes in social interactions, focusing on aversive learning mechanisms that shape social behavior. The project seeks to identify how individuals learn to associate negative outcomes with others, both directly through interaction and indirectly through observation. By building and testing a neural model of social-emotional learning, we aim to elucidate the underlying cognitive, emotional, and social mechanisms. Using a combination of experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, and cognitive neuroscience techniques, this interdisciplinary study will explore the role of factors such as ethnic group belonging, emotional expressiveness, moral and social status, empathy, and mental state attributions. The research will map distinct neural networks involved, including affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed systems. This work has significant potential to inform our understanding of group conflicts, norm compliance, and social disorders such as social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. By uncovering the neural underpinnings of social learning, this project could contribute to more effective interventions and treatments for these conditions."
