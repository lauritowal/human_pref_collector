        "Title: Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\n\nThis proposal aims to build a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. Our approach overcomes challenges inherent in studying social information representation, such as conceptual and technical difficulties and the use of simplistic stimuli. Leveraging recent advances in brain signal analysis, we will employ naturalistic neuroscience methods to study social interaction, focusing on temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals. Key hypotheses include the role of selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction in supporting interpersonal understanding, the association between similarities in cognitive task sets and synchronous brain activity, and the enhancing effect of intense emotional experiences on brain response synchronization and information flow. This project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of brain dynamics in social interaction and potentially contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience."
