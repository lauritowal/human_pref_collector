        "Title: Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century\n\nThis project, titled \"Experimentation versus Interpretation: Exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century,\" is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at transforming the conventional paradigms of musical performance. Situated at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, the project's primary focus is on shifting the emphasis from text-based to performative-based musical works, fostering experimental performance practices, and assessing the transferability of scientific experimentation methodologies to the realm of music performance.\n\nThe proposed research will investigate traditional conceptions bound to historical interpretations, create new paths through experimental practices, and provide concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. Utilizing material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs, the project will contribute to both theoretical and practical innovations in the field. Expected outcomes include opportunities for scholarship, concrete examples of innovative performance practices, and a shift towards a more experimental approach in music performance.\n\nThis project aligns with the broader discourse on artistic experimentation and aims to redefine the boundaries of musical performance in the 21st century. Through a combination of theoretical investigation and practical components, the project seeks to fundamentally change the landscape of musical performance, offering a new and alternative approach to traditional 'interpretation'."
