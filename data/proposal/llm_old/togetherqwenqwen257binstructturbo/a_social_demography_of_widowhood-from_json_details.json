        "Title: A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project, titled \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies,\" aimed at addressing the increasing relevance of widowhood in the context of global ageing populations. The project will employ innovative approaches to explore the risk and duration of widowhood, as well as the mental health and economic consequences experienced by widows, focusing on social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age. By leveraging high-quality, harmonized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries from 1985 to 2050, the project will employ advanced statistical methodologies to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates. This research will facilitate new insights into the challenges faced by the widowed population and their families, contributing significantly to the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems. The project fills a notable gap in existing research, which predominantly focuses on divorce rather than widowhood, and extends beyond current assessments by examining changes in wellbeing after bereavement in the context of terminal health decline before death."
