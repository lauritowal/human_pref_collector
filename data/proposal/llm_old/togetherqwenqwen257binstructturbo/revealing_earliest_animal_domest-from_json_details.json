        "Title: Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking Neolithic archaeological research project aimed at unraveling the origins of animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent. The project will focus on the early evidences of sheep and goat management in the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent. Utilizing advanced biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, the research will investigate mechanisms such as the control of animals' reproductive cycles, changes to feeding habits, and the interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. By analyzing faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers, this project aims to identify how human societies altered animals and establish when and where domestication processes began. This study will contribute significantly to our understanding of the origin of animal domesticates, providing insights into early caprine management practices and challenging existing paradigms in the field."
