        "Title: Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds\n\nAbstract: This project, titled \"Blockchain4Biodiversity: A Digital Farmers’ Market Incentivizing Sustainable Innovations with Indigenous Seeds,\" aims to develop and test ReSeed, a blockchain-based platform designed to promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity. The project focuses on farmers' indigenous seeds and associated know-how (ISK), addressing the significant challenges of dwindling economic incentives for their cultivation and conservation. The platform will ensure equitable and traceable transfers of ISK while incentivizing honest reporting of downstream research, thereby enhancing global food security and sustainable agriculture practices. ReSeed will integrate with international regulatory frameworks, minimizing legal amendments and ensuring ethical governance. Utilizing a mixed-methods research approach, the project will engage key stakeholders, including suppliers and buyers of ISK, to ensure broad impact. Over 12 years, our research has demonstrated that in situ conservation, value addition to farmers' ISK, and economic and environmental benefits to small farmers are attainable through this innovative solution. This project will contribute to global efforts in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent and equitable market for ISK."
