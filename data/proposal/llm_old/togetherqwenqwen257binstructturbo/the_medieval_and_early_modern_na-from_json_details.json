        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods, an area least studied and understood in maritime expansion. Entitled \"The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use,\" the project aims to fill a significant gap in the field of History of Cartography. Detailed technical study of these charts is still in its infancy, and this proposal offers a broader and more complex set of questions for exploration, spanning a longer period of time. The project will employ an interdisciplinary approach, integrating analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and the examination of manuscripts through special lighting. Key research questions include the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, the technical evolution of charts over time, and their use at sea. The objectives are to unveil hidden graphic content, characterize main geometric features, establish connections with navigational methods, and simulate chart construction numerically. Building upon previous work, such as the solution of the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this project will contribute significantly to the History of Cartography and intellectual history at large."
