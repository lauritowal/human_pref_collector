        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project \"In Praise of Community: Shared Creativity in Arts and Politics in Italy (1959-1979)\" which aims to explore and document the performing arts as an outcome of commonality practices during the 1960s and 1970s. The project will focus on artist collaborations and apply the 'will-to-the-common' concept to counterculture art. It will highlight the significance of these artistic communities both locally and internationally, and create a comprehensive digital archive of Italian artists' performances. Utilizing new modeling of performing arts knowledge and innovative digital archive visualization, the project will bridge historical, philosophical, artistic, and sociological debates with Social Network Theory. The outcomes include a systematic analysis of the performing arts field, a digital archive for preservation, and the restoration and dissemination of Italian performing arts heritage. This project, titled INCOMMON, will be the first to systematically analyze the performing arts as a result of commonality practices, offering a groundbreaking approach to the field."
