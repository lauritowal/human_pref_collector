        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the complex interplay between men's evolving family dynamics and work lives, and their impact on health and cognition. Titled \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" the study aims to address gender health disparities, particularly the higher premature mortality rates and significant preventable excess mortality among men. By focusing on life stages from young adulthood to midlife, the project will examine cohort and period differences, work-life interface challenges, and the decline of the traditional male breadwinner role. Additionally, it will assess the increased participation of fathers in childcare. The research employs a robust methodology to disentangle selection and causality effects. Data sources include Norwegian population registers, surveys, and genetic data, with health measures encompassing self-reported, clinical, and register data. Employment data will cover work participation and occupation, with a large sample size of over 12,000 men aged from late teens to 36-69. The ultimate goal is to improve men's health and cognition, enhancing their contributions to family, labor market, and society. This preliminary funding is sought to advance these critical investigations."
