        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive study titled \"The cognitive primers of human culture: a comparative approach to the emergence of innovations,\" aimed at elucidating the conditions driving innovations across primates, with a focus on the ability to make and use sharp stone tools (flakes) and its significance in human cultural development. The study will define the baseline stone manipulation propensities of chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques using advanced artificial intelligence coding methods. It will test the roles of exposure and experience as drivers of innovations through an extensive experimental paradigm involving a large sample size (N=350) and long-term testing protocols over approximately four years. Comparative analysis of primate assemblages with the oldest known human stone tools will help infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Employing a triangulation approach, structural equation models, and rigorous experimental design, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations and the cognitive underpinnings of human culture. The proposal aims for a research duration of approximately four years and is expected to yield significant insights into the evolutionary pathways that led to human cultural flourishing."
