        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the development of a novel, portable EEG-based device to screen social predispositions in newborns, named \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns.\" The primary goal is to design a wireless, dry-electrode system capable of rapid, automatic testing of face processing in under two minutes, utilizing an innovative oscillatory visual presentation. This device aims to provide an early, objective EEG-based biomarker for identifying newborns at risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Key features include a user-friendly, automatic on-line extraction algorithm and a low-power, wireless design. This innovative technology fills a significant market gap by offering the first fully portable EEG system for newborns, facilitating home testing and large-scale screening protocols. Early identification through this biomarker could lead to more effective early behavioral interventions, enhancing cognitive and social development. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions in early infancy, with broad applications in clinical and research settings."
