        "Title: Multilingual Locals, Significant Geographies: A New Approach to World Literature\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a novel approach to world literature by focusing on multilingual locals and significant geographies. The project examines the literary multilingualism of North India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, emphasizing the roles of colonial diglossia, oral traditions, and local transculturations. By critiquing the monolingual straitjacket of modern literary histories, the project aims to position non-Western literature within a global timeline and map, ensuring their entry into the global canon. Key periods of focus include imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment. The study explores forms of multilingualism, debates on world literature, and the dynamics of appropriation, co-constitution, and multiplicity of choices and trajectories. The outcomes include a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues. Collaborative efforts involve scholars from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France. This project will contribute significantly to the field by challenging existing notions and fostering a more inclusive understanding of world literature."
