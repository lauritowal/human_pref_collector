        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant seeks to fund the development and documentation of a novel transcultural musical practice that integrates Turkey's rich musical heritage with contemporary concert music. The project, titled \"Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice,\" will be based in Turkey and will involve research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK. Key objectives include integrating traditional Turkish instruments and voices into contemporary music, training both traditional and Western musicians in new repertoires and vocal techniques, and developing innovative approaches for modeling the impacts of music on musicians and audiences. The project will also focus on creating an ensemble interface with newly designed instruments, conducting timbre studies, and mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems. The outputs will include an e-book, an orchestration manual, and online audio and visual examples. This project aims to establish a template for transcultural musical practice and overcome cultural barriers, with the ultimate goal of fostering a more inclusive and diverse musical landscape. The proposed work will be published by Cambridge University Press."
