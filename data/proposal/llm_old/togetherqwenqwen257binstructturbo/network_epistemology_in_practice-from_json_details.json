        "Title: Network Epistemology in Practice: Understanding Knowledge Generation at CERN\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the epistemological underpinnings of large-scale scientific collaboration through the lens of particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). Using digital humanities tools, we aim to address the challenge of capturing and analyzing complex research processes within CERNâ€™s extensive communication networks. Our objectives include understanding how knowledge is generated and validated in large scientific collaborations, characterizing collective research practices, and reconstructing internal communication from born-digital sources such as e-mails and internal wiki pages. We will develop historiographic guidelines for future studies and contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation. Methodological innovations, such as the application of digital tools and computational methods, will be employed to adapt theoretical models of network epistemology. This project will produce historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources and offer practical strategies for best practices in the history and philosophy of science. By focusing on CERN, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of network epistemology in practice and set new standards for interdisciplinary research."
