        "Title: \"Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School\"\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support the ERC-team (ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay) in addressing critical issues of peer rejection, victimization, low teacher support, and conflictual teacher-student relations during the high school transition. The project, titled \"A.L.I.B.I. (Alien Learning Interactions Building Insight),\" focuses on enhancing self-regulation and stress-regulation among children. A.L.I.B.I. is a serious game that offers a realistic yet safe learning environment, utilizing game elements to promote prosocial behaviors through virtual high school interactions. Players uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, fostering perspective-taking and considering multiple response options. This game appeals to children through its tablet-based presentation, enabling rehearsal of prosocial behaviors. The project aims to develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone game, assess its effectiveness, integrate it into school transition trainings, and develop a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. Three school counseling organizations will collaborate to ensure effective implementation in three Dutch regions."
