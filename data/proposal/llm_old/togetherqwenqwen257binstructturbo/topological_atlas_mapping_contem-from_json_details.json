        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop \"Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes,\" a transdisciplinary research program aimed at representing borders as dynamic and porous entities through the lens of those who encounter them. The concept of borders is characterized as both shifting and solidified, operating beyond legal frameworks and often impervious to mobility for some while open for others. This project, centered around the formation of ISIS and the fluctuating European borders, addresses the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations and the variable enforcement of treaties. \n\nThe research will employ a topological approach, integrating visual counter-geographies and participative methodologies using digital technologies, including GIS and Google Earth. The aim is to produce seamless transition maps representing borders from the perspective of migrants and security apparatus, disrupting traditional cartographic norms. This project will develop a digital atlas that not only maps but also analyzes and intervenes in border landscapes, fostering co-produced knowledge in situations of crisis. \n\nBy adopting a visual and co-produced research approach, the project seeks to adapt to the fluid nature of borders, enabling an understanding of these spaces beyond top-down perspectives. The research questions this project aims to answer are: How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them? This topological atlas will enhance academic inquiry, contribute to knowledge production, and have a significant impact on our understanding of contemporary borderscapes."
