        "The proposed project, \"Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain),\" aims to systematically collect and edit personal letters from the 17th to early 19th centuries. This archive will focus on writings by ordinary individuals such as servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, with particular attention to their interactions with institutions like the Inquisition and civil courts. The project will feature a historical-linguistic study, integrating sociological interviews to provide well-contextualized insights into inter-personal modes of relation within traditional communities. It will explore oral rhetoric, emotional expression, commonsense statements, confessions of non-orthodox beliefs, and narration of trivial incidents. The output will include a large collection assembly, an online digital edition, philological treatment, and a cultural and linguistic study, adhering to Textual Criticism standards. This project seeks to enrich our understanding of everyday life and subversive expressions in early modern Portugal and Spain."
