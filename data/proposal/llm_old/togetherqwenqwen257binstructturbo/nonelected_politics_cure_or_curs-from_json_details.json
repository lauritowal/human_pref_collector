        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the effects of non-elected politics—specifically, the delegation of political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts—on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. The project addresses growing disengagement, historically low electoral turnout, the rise of anti-establishment and populist parties, declining trust in representative institutions, and the need for institutional reforms. Our central hypothesis posits that non-elected politics does not uniformly enhance or undermine support for representative democracy. Key features include a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and an analysis of how exposure to non-elected politics influences attitudes towards representative democracy. Methodologically, we will employ online survey experiments and panel surveys. The implications of our findings are far-reaching, offering insights into potential avenues for democracy revitalization in the face of contemporary challenges. This research seeks to contribute to a nuanced understanding of how innovative democratic practices can address the crisis of representative democracy in Europe."
