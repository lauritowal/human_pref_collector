        "Title: Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal, titled \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan,\" aims to advance our understanding of the neurocognitive architectures underpinning predictive processing in memory systems. Using the predictive coding framework, the research will explore the nature and influence of internal models on future state predictions, as well as the variability of prediction processes across different stages of life, from children to older adults. The study will specifically address two key empirical questions: the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, and the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation to senescence. The research aims to integrate predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs. The study population includes children, younger adults, and older adults, with a focus on episodic and semantic memory. By examining the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits, the project will contribute to the development of a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle and provide insights into the emergence of memory disorders at different life stages. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of memory functioning and cognitive development across the lifespan."
