        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception,\" aims to elucidate the neural basis of conscious perception, focusing on why certain visual stimuli are perceived while others are not. Building upon our previous work demonstrating that weak simple stimuli can be reported if they elicit minimal activity in the frontal cortex related to working memory storage, we propose to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions. Our research will utilize cutting-edge methods, including measuring activity of single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using implanted electrodes, recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey, and characterizing neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will also employ perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys to measure a 'functional connectome.' By investigating brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience, we expect to provide profound insights into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception. This project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of consciousness and contribute to the broader field of cognitive neuroscience."
