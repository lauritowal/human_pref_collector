        "Title: Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address critical cooperation problems in todayâ€™s digital and real-world markets through an innovative economic engineering approach, inspired by the work of Alvin Roth. The project's importance lies in the essential role of cooperation for both economic and societal well-being. The proposed research will employ experimental methods and behavioral game theory to develop and test new mechanisms that promote cooperation in various market contexts.\n\nThe first work package focuses on electronic reputation mechanisms to enhance trust and cooperation in the digital world, addressing the flaws in current Internet-based trust mechanisms. The second package will design innovative mechanisms to avoid wasteful arms races for speed, particularly in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, aiming to improve market liquidity and stability. The third package explores market designs that align with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchanges and pollution rights trading, to reduce distaste for certain transactions.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. This project will contribute to a more cooperative and efficient economic landscape, benefiting both businesses and consumers in the digital and traditional economies."
