        "Title: Intergroup Toleration: Its Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\n\nThis proposal aims to advance the state of the art in social sciences by focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration, addressing the pressing question of living harmoniously in increasingly diverse societies. The project will systematically explore the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the processes that underlie it, its limits, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. Through a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of intergroup toleration. This research is timely and ground-breaking, as systematic empirical research in this area is scarce. The expected outcome is to offer valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, contributing to the development of a more tolerant society. This project not only addresses a critical gap in our knowledge but also has significant implications for fostering harmonious coexistence in culturally diverse settings."
