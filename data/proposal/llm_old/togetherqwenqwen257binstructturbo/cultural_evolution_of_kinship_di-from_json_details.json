        "Title: Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal seeks to investigate the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time through the VARIKIN-Evolution, VARIKIN-Usage, and VARIKIN-Development projects. Using comparative phylogenetic modeling on 8 language families, VARIKIN-Evolution will analyze how kinship terminologies and family norms change. VARIKIN-Usage will explore the usage of kinship language in spoken and written forms through corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews. VARIKIN-Development will examine how children in small-scale, non-Western communities acquire and understand kinship concepts through participant observation and elicitation tasks. The project's objectives are to identify universal patterns of kinship change, examine the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, link individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterize cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. By integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, this highly multidisciplinary approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cultural evolution of kinship diversity."
