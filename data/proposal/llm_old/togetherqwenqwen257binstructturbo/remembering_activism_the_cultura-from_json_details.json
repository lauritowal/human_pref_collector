        "Title: Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the complex dynamics of how activism has been remembered and forgotten in Europe from the late 19th century to the present. The project, titled \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe\" (ReAct), will offer the first comprehensive analysis of protest depiction across various media regimes. Through a detailed examination of the periods 1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012, ReAct will reveal continuities and changes in how activism is depicted in texts, images, and commemorative practices. By addressing the lines of inquiry into mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes, the project will demonstrate the role of these elements in conveying the memory of protest and how such memory feeds back into later movements. Innovative methodologies, including the use of network visualization to map narrative reproduction and references, will be employed to achieve these aims. The implications of this work are far-reaching, offering a major reorientation in cultural memory research, developing critical analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, and opening up a new area for social movement research. This project will provide crucial insights into how collective memory and identity are rethought and reshaped over time."
