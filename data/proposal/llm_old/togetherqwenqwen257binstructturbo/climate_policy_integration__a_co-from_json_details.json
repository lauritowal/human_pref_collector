        "Title: CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a new theory explaining the poor coordination among growing climate policy regimes, with a focus on the European Union, projected to miss its 2050 net-zero target. The research will address the lack of a system-level picture of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies, inadequate theories, and appropriate study methods. Through a multi-method approach, including quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, and comparative case studies, we aim to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand their temporal dynamics, and identify system-level solutions. Comparative analysis of the EU and selected member states will provide insights into coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The project aims to simulate potential policy reforms and offer practical advice to enhance climate policy integration in the EU, advancing the broader debate beyond climate policy. Given the researcher's expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, this study is expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of complex policy integration dynamics."
