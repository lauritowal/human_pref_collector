        "Title: Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Post-Tridentine Period\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal, titled \"Global Economies of Salvation. Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period,\" seeks to explore how artworks were utilized in the negotiation of spiritual status with the Roman Curia during the post-Tridentine period. The research project, GLOBECOSAL, focuses on Iberian empires, where the Catholic Church's adherence to Tridentine models of sanctity intersected with local constructions of sanctity. By examining the production of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, the project aims to challenge prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism and colonialism. Employing a global market of symbolic values as a theoretical framework, the study will trace the circulation of material objects and analyze iconographies within the context of global networks of knowledge transmission. This interdisciplinary approach, involving critical sociology, will contribute to the global history of early modern art, affirming the role of society in producing saints, and reevaluating the conflict between the Catholic Church and Protestants in the early modern world."
