        "Title: We are all Ayotzinapa: The Role of Digital Media in Shaping Transnational Memories on Disappearance\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the impact of digital media on the transnational memory of the 43 students who disappeared in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, in September 2014. The project aims to understand how digital media shapes and mobilizes public understanding and engagement with the issue, highlighting its role in counter-movements against government inaction. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, we will examine the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries of digital memory, comparing the Mexican case with social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina. Theoretical and empirical research will be conducted to develop a model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with transnational scope. This study is significant as it underscores the new media's potential in citizen engagement and activism, contributing to a broader understanding of memory and justice in the digital age."
