        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking project titled \"Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale for the Expansion and Evolution of Humans.\" The project aims to refine the understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics over the last 2.6 million years, particularly focusing on the timing of early human expansion into Europe and the relationship to environmental changes. Utilizing paired dating methods, including amino acid dating and thermoluminescence dating, the research will address critical questions regarding climatic conditions during human expansion and differences in tool technologies. By employing calcitic fossils and snail opercula as key dating materials, the study will cover a broad geographical scale, encompassing regions such as Britain and the Black Sea. This pan-European chronology will significantly improve our comprehension of human evolution and migration patterns in response to climatic oscillations, expansion of ice sheets, and sea-level changes. The proposed research will bridge significant gaps in current understanding, particularly beyond the radiocarbon dating limit of ~60,000 years, and provide a comprehensive timescale for the entire Palaeolithic period in Eurasia."
