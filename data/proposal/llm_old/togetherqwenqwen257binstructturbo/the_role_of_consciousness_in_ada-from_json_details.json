        "Title: The Role of Consciousness in Adaptive Behavior: A Combined Empirical, Computational, and Robot-Based Approach (Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control, CDAC)\n\nAbstract: This proposal, titled \"Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC),\" aims to elucidate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior. We hypothesize that a shift towards an intentional agent-dominated world necessitates fundamentally different control architectures. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we will explore empirical, computational, and robot-based methods to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action, identify neuronal principles underlying consciousness, and construct a neuromorphic robot-based architecture for real-time, conscious control. Specifically, our project will develop parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation, complemented by a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene management. Our outcomes will include a framework advancing beyond current state-of-the-art, system-level models of conscious architecture, computational studies of the neuronal substrate, and empirical validations with both humanoid robots and stroke patients. This research is crucial for advancing our understanding of the mind and brain, contributing to new neurorehabilitation technologies, and developing advanced tools for robotics with enhanced social competence."
