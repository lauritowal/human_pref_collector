        "Title: Meeting Darwin's Last Challenge: Toward a Global Tree of Human Languages and Genes\n\nThis proposal seeks to address Darwin's long-standing prediction of the eventual isomorphy between the tree of languages and the tree of populations. Traditional methods, such as narrow classical linguistic classification and probabilistic mass comparisons, have proven insufficient. We propose a novel approach, rooted in the works of Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994), by establishing a correspondence between language families and classical genetic markers. Our method, based on grammatical evidence and advances in formal and typological linguistics (Longobardi & Guardiano, 2009), offers unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, capable of measuring linguistic distances between remote populations. A collaborative effort involving linguists and biologists will select significant populations for language and gene sampling, utilizing the latest genetic tools such as genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome markers, and mitochondrial DNA. Biostatistical methods will be employed to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships with linguistic diversity. This project promises to significantly enhance our understanding of human evolution and linguistic history."
