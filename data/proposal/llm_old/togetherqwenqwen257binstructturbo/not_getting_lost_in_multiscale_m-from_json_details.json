        "Abstract:\n\nThe LostInZoom project proposes a novel approach to enhance multi-scale map navigation, particularly crucial in crisis management scenarios. Focused on creating a seamless user experience during zooming interactions, this project aims to establish new zooming paradigms for multi-scale maps by leveraging multi-scale visual landmarks as anchors. The project objectives include identifying these visual landmarks, developing cartographic generalisation techniques, and designing new zooming interactions centered around these landmarks. Given the widespread use of multi-scale interactive maps in both professional and everyday contexts, this research addresses a significant gap in current map design guidelines, which do not adequately support multi-scale interactive maps. Through experimental exploration of cognition, the design of cartographic generalisation techniques, and the creation of new zooming interactions, the project seeks to mitigate the common issue of map users feeling disoriented after zooming interactions. The unique contribution of this project is its focus on anchor landmarks, which promise to enhance user understanding and control during exploration of multi-scale maps, thereby significantly improving the effectiveness of crisis management operations."
