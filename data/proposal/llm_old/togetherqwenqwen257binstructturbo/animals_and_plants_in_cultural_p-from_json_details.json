        "Title: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the dynamic interplay between human and non-human beings as depicted in texts, cinema, and art about the Amazon River Basin. The hypothesis posits that cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants, highlighting their significant role in shaping human cultural life. By focusing on the concept of zoophytography, this project will address the main challenge of assessing how human cultural productions about Amazonia articulate the lives and perspectives of animals and plants. The research will be divided into three streams: defining and tracing the roots of Amazonian zoophytography, analyzing how animals are articulated in cultural productions, and examining plant inscription in various media. This project contributes to the environmental humanities, offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, a revelation of the interdependence between humans and non-humans, increased awareness of environmental degradation in the region, and the uncovering of more equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants."
