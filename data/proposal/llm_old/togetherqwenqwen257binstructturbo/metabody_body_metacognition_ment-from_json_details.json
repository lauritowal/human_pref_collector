        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant seeks to explore the novel concept of Body Imagining, central to the project METABODY. METABODY aims to capture the dynamic inference of body image, influenced by prior expectations and new information, in a modern context where identity is negotiated between invariance and invention. The project focuses on the balance of prior beliefs and new information at the metacognitive level, hypothesizing that body image disturbances are linked to 1st and 2nd order cognitive abilities. The empirical work packages will investigate three key areas: Body Metacognition, which examines the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives; Body Mentalizing, exploring the balance between embodied experience and social perspectives; and Body Decision Making, focusing on the balance between current, future, and ideal body perspectives. The overarching goal is to understand identity negotiation in the context of body modification options, contributing significantly to our understanding of body image processes and their impact on mental and physical well-being."
