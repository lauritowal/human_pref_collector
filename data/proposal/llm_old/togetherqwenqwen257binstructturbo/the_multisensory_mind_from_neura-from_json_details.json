        "The proposal titled \"The multisensory mind: From neural mechanisms to cognition\" seeks to advance our understanding of multisensory integration (MI) through a comprehensive research program. This study will employ a multi-faceted approach, utilizing human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine neural and neurochemical markers of MI. The project will investigate a novel hypothesis regarding synchronized neural populations in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. By integrating these methods, the research aims to provide a deeper understanding of how sensory inputs merge into coherent percepts. This knowledge has significant potential for enhancing our understanding of MI and developing innovative treatments for conditions characterized by impaired multisensory integration. The findings could contribute to the broader field of cognitive neuroscience and improve clinical practices in neuropsychiatry."
