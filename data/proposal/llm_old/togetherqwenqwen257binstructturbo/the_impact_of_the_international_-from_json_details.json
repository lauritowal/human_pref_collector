    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to explore the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse through the analysis of eviction litigation cases in Europe (2007-2011), affecting approximately 700,000 individuals. The project employs data science techniques, including citation network analysis and machine learning, to examine legal big data from national supreme and lower level courts, which resulted from the financial crisis. The primary objectives are to identify key predictors of court decisions and to empirically analyze the conceptualization of the right to housing as a network of international rights. This data-driven approach will provide insights into how international legal frameworks influence national legal practices and decision-making. The potential outcomes include the development of predictive models for future court decisions and the identification of areas for further research in other legal domains. This study will contribute to the broader understanding of the intersection between international law and national legal systems, particularly in the context of housing rights and eviction litigation."
