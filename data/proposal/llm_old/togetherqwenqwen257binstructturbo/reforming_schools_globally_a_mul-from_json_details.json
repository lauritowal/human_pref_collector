        "Title: Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector (REFORMED)\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal, titled \"REFORMED,\" aims to develop a comprehensive research approach to examine the adoption, reformulation, and effects of school autonomy and accountability (SAWA) policies globally. The project will analyze these policies within a range of countries, characterized by different administrative traditions and levels of development, with a particular focus on OECD's influence. Our research will address key questions about the dissemination of SAWA policies, policy convergence in education, and the contextual and institutional circumstances that influence their implementation. By combining robust, multi-scalar, and mixed-methods strategies (quantitative and qualitative), REFORMED will explore the effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity at the school level. The project will involve international bureaucrats and teachers, providing a nuanced understanding of policy enactment processes and institutional frameworks. Addressing research gaps in inconclusive and mixed findings, REFORMED seeks to provide actionable insights for policy-makers, educators, and researchers globally."
