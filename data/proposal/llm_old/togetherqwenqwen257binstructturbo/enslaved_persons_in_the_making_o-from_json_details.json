        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to establish the SLaVEgents project, which aims to explore the critical role of enslaved persons in the formation of ancient Western Eurasian and North African societies and cultures from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. Focusing on slave agency, the project will utilize a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin languages. The research team, led by a Principal Investigator and comprising eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral fellows, and three PhD candidates, will produce a digital prosopography, publish a monograph, two collective volumes, and 15 articles, among other outputs. The project will also support three PhD dissertations, organize three workshops, host an international conference, and develop a website to disseminate findings. By examining the multifaceted identities, communities, and networks of enslaved individuals, this project will illuminate the significant historical transformations they influenced."
