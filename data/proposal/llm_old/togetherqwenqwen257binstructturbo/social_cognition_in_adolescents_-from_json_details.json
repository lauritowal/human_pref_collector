        "Abstract:\n\nThis longitudinal study, titled \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks,\" aims to elucidate the interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescent development. The proposed research focuses on integrating social network analysis with social neuroscience experimental approaches to understand how changes in social brain function relate to changes in social network position and structure. The project targets 1,000 adolescents from 50 classes, utilizing a combination of ecological momentary assessment and mobile sensing for social networks data. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) annually for three years to measure social-cognitive functions. The study will employ a series of six assessments over three years, including understanding and interacting with others. By integrating quantitative and qualitative methods, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic phase between social networks and the social brain, contributing to the development of effective interventions for adolescent social cognition."
