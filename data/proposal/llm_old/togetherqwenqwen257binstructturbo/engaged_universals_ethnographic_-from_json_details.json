        "Title: Engaged Universals: Ethnographic Explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the Public Good in Africa\n\nAbstract:\nThis anthropological study aims to explore the interpretation and implementation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries, focusing on its impact on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions. UHC, defined as ensuring access to health services without financial hardship, is a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals. The project addresses the complex challenges faced by African states, including the legacy of structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, privatization, and the burden of payment on the poor. By examining the roles of actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, the research will explore the relations between states and citizens, and the dynamics of formal and informal social networks supporting health. Adopting a multi-sited and multi-level ethnographic approach, the project will reveal the contested nature of UHC, its partial pursuit by African states, and the conflicting interests at play. This research will contribute new directions in understanding UHC and its public good characteristics, providing insights that are relevant beyond Africa."
