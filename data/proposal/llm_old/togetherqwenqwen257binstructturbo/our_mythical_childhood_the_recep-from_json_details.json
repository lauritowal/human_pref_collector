        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop a pioneering approach to the reception of Classical Antiquity in children’s and young adults’ culture, with a focus on its adaptation and transformation in response to regional and global challenges. The project, titled \"Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges,\" aims to offer profound insights into identity formation and the initiation into adulthood through the lens of ancient narratives. By addressing the limitations of current research, which primarily focuses on Western culture, this project will apply regional perspectives and conduct comparative studies of reception models across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. The international research team will explore how popular culture shapes the reception of Classical Antiquity, contributing to a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations. Expected outcomes include a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. This project will have a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture, fostering integration and stimulating cultural exchange."
