        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach,\" aims to explore the fundamental aspects of human friendship by examining its evolutionary roots and unique characteristics. This research is crucial for understanding human health, public health, and political policy. By addressing social isolation—a critical risk factor for heart disease and other health issues—we seek to enhance our knowledge of friendship dynamics. The study will focus on the evolutionary origins of friendship and human specializations, comparing nonhuman primates, specifically macaques, with heavy smokers, drinkers, and obese individuals. Our approach includes analyzing a cross-species dataset and conducting social experiments. The primary aims are to test the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species, determine if having information on others' friendships is uniquely human, and evaluate whether social isolation results from competitive exclusion. This research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary perspective of friendship, contributing to the broader field of human social behavior and health."
