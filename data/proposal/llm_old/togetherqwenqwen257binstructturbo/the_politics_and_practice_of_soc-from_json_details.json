        "The grant proposal titled \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\" aims to explore the complex interplay between social media and conflict dynamics in Africa, with a particular focus on Eastern Africa. Spanning five years, this initiative seeks to extend internet reach to remote and conflict-affected regions, ensuring affordable access for the world's poorest and those in areas with weak state governance. The project's primary goal is to investigate how social media access impacts peace-building versus violence perpetuation. Through detailed examination of dangerous speech online, individual exit and entry from conflict, actors' strategies to shape the internet, and governance actors' social media use, this research will address critical questions about the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, the role of public authorities in fostering violence or peace, and the transformative impact of social media on people's experiences with conflict. This project will contribute significantly to understanding and addressing the challenges posed by social media in conflict-affected communities, particularly in Africa."
