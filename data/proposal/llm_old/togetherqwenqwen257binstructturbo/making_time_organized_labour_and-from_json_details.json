        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" seeks to promote work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe through the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections. The project focuses on the crucial role of trade unions in advancing social policies that support sustainable work through family and self-care time. Given the predominance of women in caregiving roles and union membership, this research will explore the mechanisms through which organized labour influences policy development, particularly in the context of child care, aging parent care, spousal care, sick leave, and disability benefits. Adopting a mixed-method approach, the project will conduct quantitative analysis on care leave provisions in rich democracies since 1965 and qualitative analysis in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. The study aims to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships through an interdisciplinary lens, drawing on comparative policy analysis and social movement research. The project's data infrastructure development will result in a longitudinal, comparative dataset on care leave provisions, and the outcomes will assess organized labour's role as a key partner in shaping sustainable work policies."
