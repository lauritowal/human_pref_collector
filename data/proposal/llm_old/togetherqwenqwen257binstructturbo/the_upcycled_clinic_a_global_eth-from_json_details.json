        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant seeks to fund \"The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine,\" an innovative ethnographic project aimed at addressing wastefulness in medical practices. The project, comprising five sub-projects in diverse locations including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., will focus on understanding conditions that foster creative material engagement within clinics. By involving ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff, the project will utilize fieldwork, interviews, and the analysis of open datasets to explore improvisation and resourcefulness. Our objective is to move beyond traditional hospital ethnographies that center on patient encounters, offering a first-of-its-kind, globally oriented study of material creativity in clinic settings. This research will contribute to advancing theories of materiality, addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace, and developing new methods for reusing and sharing research materials. The practical outcomes will include articulating conditions for healthcare creativity and local solutions to wastefulness and material shortage, with broader implications for addressing global health challenges through sustainable practices."
