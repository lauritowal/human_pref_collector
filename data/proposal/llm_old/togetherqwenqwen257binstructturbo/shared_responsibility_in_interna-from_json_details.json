        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the project \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES), designed to reframe the allocation of responsibilities in cooperative international actions. The project aims to address the challenge of responsibility dilution among multiple actors, ensuring the integrity of international rule of law and providing effective remedies for injured parties. SHARES seeks to uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities, developing new perspectives that match international cooperation with appropriate systems of shared responsibility. Key challenges include determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and preventing the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility. Using a combination of conceptual and theoretical foundations, along with an empirical approach through case studies, SHARES will explore principles of collective, joint, and proportional responsibility, and processes for judicial systems to account for collective international policies. This project is essential for enhancing the effectiveness and accountability of international law in a collaborative global environment."
