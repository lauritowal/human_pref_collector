        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the enduring legacies of the colonial-liberation wars (1961-1974/5) in Portugal and its African colonies (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe) through the lens of memory and silence. The project, entitled \"Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times,\" adopts a diachronic and comparative approach to analyze how these wars have been memorialized and silenced over time. Key objectives include producing innovative knowledge on the evolution of war memories and silences, contrasting changes in memory and silence from the conflicts' end to the present, examining historical judgements and memories in Portugal and its African countries, and offering a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies. CROME aims to address the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism, focusing on the role of postcolonial states in past mobilization and the dynamics between social and individual memories. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between colonial history and postcolonial societies."
