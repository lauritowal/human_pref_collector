        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Inequality-aware Market Design,\" aims to explore optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of detectable inequalities. The project's core objective is to develop a theoretical framework, Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD), that maximizes welfare through mechanisms sensitive to redistributive preferences among participants. The methodology leverages a mechanism-design framework, incorporating private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights. The proposed IMD framework aims to sacrifice some allocative efficiency for a more desirable surplus split, particularly in policy areas such as rent control, healthcare, and transit. We hypothesize that such an approach can lead to more equitable outcomes, despite potential inefficiencies. Theoretical contributions include addressing inequality in market-design settings, distinguishing from traditional mechanisms focused solely on allocative efficiency and revenue. The research complements public-finance approaches through tax systems and provides policy guidance on distortionary market interventions when inequality concerns are significant."
