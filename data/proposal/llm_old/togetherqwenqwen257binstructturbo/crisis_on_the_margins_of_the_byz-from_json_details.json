        "Title: Crisis on the Margins of the Byzantine Empire: A Bio-Archaeological Project on Resilience and Collapse in Early Christian Development of the Negev Desert\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an innovative, integrative, and data-intensive bio-archaeological project aimed at understanding the long-term sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments. Specifically, the project will explore the contexts of collapse and resilience within Byzantine early Christian urban centers in the Negev Desert during the 4th-7th centuries AD. The research questions focus on social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation (both climatic and anthropogenic), and the question of plague. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, including archaeological studies of households and landscapes, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, geological analysis, chronometric techniques, artifact analysis, and contextual data analysis, the project aims to provide critical re-evaluations of current knowledge based on new data. This research is particularly relevant in addressing societal vulnerability in marginal regions, a problem that has expanded to global levels in our contemporary world. Despite the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, this project promises to offer more nuanced and informed generalizations regarding the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development."
