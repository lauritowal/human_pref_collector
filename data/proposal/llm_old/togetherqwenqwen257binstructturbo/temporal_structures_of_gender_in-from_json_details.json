        "The proposed research, titled \"Temporal Structures of Gender Inequalities in Asian and Western Welfare Regimes,\" aims to investigate how gender inequalities are shaped by different welfare regimes, specifically focusing on the time use and its impact on family outcomes in East Asian and Western societies. Utilizing Esping-Andersen’s framework of \"three worlds\" of welfare states, this study will conduct a cross-national, historical comparative analysis of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, juxtaposed with Western societies. Key concepts to be explored include unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, public policies, gender division of labor, social inequality, modern technology, care provision, domestic labor, leisure time, and enjoyment.\n\nThe research will draw from time diary data and household panel data to analyze three levels: household, societal, and life course. By examining the temporal structures of gender inequalities, this study seeks to understand how public policies and societal norms influence the distribution of unpaid work and leisure time, thereby affecting family outcomes. This comparative analysis will provide insights into the unique dynamics of gender roles and social inequality in both East Asian and Western contexts, with implications for policy-making and social change. The findings will contribute significantly to the literature on gender, welfare regimes, and time use, offering a nuanced understanding of the temporal structures that underpin gender inequalities across different cultural and institutional contexts."
