        "The proposal, titled \"Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to Southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\" seeks to elucidate the factors that influenced hominin migration and adaptation in southern Africa. Our research will focus on the Pleistocene period, examining geomorphological and palaeoecological changes, dynamic models of precipitation and vegetation, and anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of fossils. Key hypotheses include hominin range expansions and contractions influenced by wet and dry phases, leading to reproductive isolation, and intermittent gene flow during the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation period. Post-1.5 million years ago, tectonic and hydrographic changes created barriers, fostering endemism and niche exploitation. This multidisciplinary approach integrates paleoecological, anatomical, and genetic data to understand the dynamics of hominin dispersal and adaptation in southern Africa, addressing the central question of whether dispersal was a choice or a chance event."
