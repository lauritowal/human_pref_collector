        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Becoming a mother: An integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period,\" aims to elucidate the neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral changes associated with maternal adaptations. Utilizing a prospective, longitudinal study design with five time points (pre-pregnancy, three intra-pregnancy, and two postpartum sessions), the study will recruit 3 nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, 3 women whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy, and 3 control nulliparous women. The primary objectives include establishing when brain changes begin in pregnant women and how they evolve, characterizing cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, assessing the influence of environmental and psychological factors on maternal adaptations, identifying metabolomics biomarkers associated with these adaptations, and integrating findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework. Data collection will involve neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics assessments. Deliverables will include a longitudinal RDoC-based model, intermediate longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sectional analyses post-intra-pregnancy and postpartum sessions. This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of maternal adaptations, contributing to the development of targeted interventions to support mental health and well-being during pregnancy and early motherhood."
