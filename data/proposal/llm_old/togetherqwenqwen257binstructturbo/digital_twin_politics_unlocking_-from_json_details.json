        "Title: Digital Twin Politics: Unlocking the Full Potential of Digital Twins for Sustainable Ocean Futures\n\nAbstract: This grant proposal seeks to examine the socio-technical dynamics surrounding the development and application of Digital Twin Ocean (DTO) systems, with a focus on their role in national scientific and political contexts and their implications in international multilateral negotiations. The European Commission's initiative to create a prototype DTO of the ocean presents a unique opportunity to explore the practices, policies, and politics that underpin these complex systems. TwinPolitics will re-conceptualize digital twins as socio-technical relations, employing a methodological approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative research. The project will address key challenges such as time pressure, data gaps, and the implementation of global sustainability goals, while also identifying and mitigating risks like perpetuating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and potential for abuse. The study will span the EU, USA, and China, providing a comprehensive analysis of DTO use in diverse contexts. By breaking new ground in methodological innovation, TwinPolitics aims to contribute to the sustainable future of our oceans through informed policy-making and international cooperation."
