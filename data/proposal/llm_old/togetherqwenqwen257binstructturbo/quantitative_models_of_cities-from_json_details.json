        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive project titled \"Quantitative Models of Cities,\" which aims to advance our understanding of urban economic dynamics through the integration of high-resolution data and theoretical breakthroughs. The project seeks to explore economic divergence across and within countries, as well as between cities and rural areas, with a specific focus on the 20th century. By combining quantitative models with detailed register data, we will develop a dynamic model that allows for worker and firm heterogeneity, providing insights into how these factors influence urban development.\n\nOur approach leverages recent advancements in data availability and theoretical frameworks, as exemplified by the works of Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020). The project will utilize detailed Danish data to address several policy-relevant questions, including the impact of urban transport infrastructure, the effects of height restrictions, and the influence of planning interventions on city dynamics. This research will contribute significantly to the fields of urban economics and policy analysis, offering empirical evidence to inform future urban development strategies."
