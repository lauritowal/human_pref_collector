        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges,\" seeks to explore new calls for reparations in global development contexts through a novel comparative social-science study. REPAIR (Reparations and Global Development) will compare reparations for infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. The primary objectives are to analyze how reparations are established, implemented, and received in addressing these global development challenges, and to understand these payments from economic, moral, and political perspectives. By investigating reparations as a form of wealth transfer and focusing on the \"reparative aspects\" of economic activity, REPAIR aims to contribute unique insights into the nature of reparative actions in economic life. This project is the first of its kind, broadening the comparative frame of reparations study and utilizing innovative theory and methods from economic anthropology. Through this research, we hope to identify the types of wealth transfers involved in reparations and what this reveals about the role of reparations in economic and social dynamics."
