        "The proposal, titled \"Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries,\" aims to construct a new framework for understanding the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. This project, grounded in a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, focuses on the period between the 6th and 14th centuries, with a primary emphasis on Buddhism. Key elements include cultural encounter, religious transfer, and the localisation of Buddhism, encompassing multi-layered relationships among Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan cultures. Utilizing methodologies from philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies, the research seeks to reconstruct the Buddhist network in spatial and temporal dimensions. By analyzing religious exchange as a dynamic network, this project integrates Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into Comparative Religious Studies, offering a unique perspective on the complex interactions that shaped pre-modern religious landscapes."
