        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the neural mechanisms underlying learning in the infant brain, focusing on language and complex social interactions from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. The project, titled \"Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols,\" will employ advanced neuroimaging techniques including EEG, MRI, and optical topography to elucidate the specificities of a neural functional architecture essential for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits. Six work packages are proposed: WP1 investigates age-specific statistical inferences using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms; WP2 examines the consequences of different pre-term environments on early statistical computations; WP3 explores the neural bases of word meaning and category inference; WP4 defines infant symbolic competency criteria; WP5 identifies functional localization and maturational markers using MRI; and WP6 develops new tools for multimodal brain image analysis. The overarching goal is to clarify the unique neural mechanisms that support learning in infants, providing insights into the critical period for language and social development."
