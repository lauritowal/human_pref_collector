        "This grant proposal, titled \"The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement,\" aims to explore the critical roles of reputation and corruption within the procurement processes of defense, transportation, education, and healthcare sectors. The project's design goals include avoiding waste, enhancing social welfare, preventing corruption, and ensuring contractor compliance. The proposal outlines three empirical projects that will significantly advance our understanding of these issues.\n\nThe first component focuses on the use of reputation in contract procurement, examining how vendor rating systems impact contractor performance, procurement costs, corruption concerns, and the entry of new bidders. The second component delves into corruption in public procurement, analyzing the extent of criminal networks, the effectiveness of awarding rules against corruption, and developing methods to detect corruption. The third component investigates healthcare procurement regulations, conducting a descriptive analysis of EU practices, assessing the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, and evaluating their effects on patients' welfare.\n\nThrough these projects, the proposal seeks to provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to improve procurement practices, reduce corruption, and enhance overall social welfare."
