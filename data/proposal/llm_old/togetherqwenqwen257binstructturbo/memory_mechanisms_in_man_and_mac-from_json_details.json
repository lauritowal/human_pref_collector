        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine,\" aims to validate a set of 10 provocative claims concerning long-term memory formation and maintenance in both human and artificial systems. The project is highly interdisciplinary, integrating psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development to study the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories. Experimental paradigms include the use of fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients to explore human neural processes. Computer simulations employ networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity to model memory formation. Additionally, the project seeks to develop bio-inspired hardware mimicking brain memory systems using memristor-like devices. This comprehensive approach will provide a unique insight into the parallels between human and artificial memory processes, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of memory mechanisms."
