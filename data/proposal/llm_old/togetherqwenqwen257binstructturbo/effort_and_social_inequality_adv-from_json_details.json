        "The proposed project, \"Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects,\" aims to enhance our understanding of the role of effort in perpetuating social inequality. This initiative seeks to advance knowledge on intergenerational mobility and improve equality of opportunity. Specifically, we will investigate whether children's effort levels differ based on their parents' socioeconomic backgrounds and explore how these disparities may be influenced by the intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations. To achieve these aims, we will develop and utilize cutting-edge methods, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry, to measure cognitive effort. The study will collect data from school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany, employing both experimental and survey methodologies for robust analysis. The project holds the potential to provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort, stimulate new research, and offer insights for educational practitioners and policy design. Ultimately, the findings will contribute to informed debates about social inequality and its mitigation."
