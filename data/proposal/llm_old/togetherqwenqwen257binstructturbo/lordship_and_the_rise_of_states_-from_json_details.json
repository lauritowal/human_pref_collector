        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to fund a comprehensive study titled \"Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600,\" focusing on the period from 1300 to 1600 in Western Europe. Departing from conventional interpretations, this project challenges the assumption of centralization as a linear process, instead proposing a nuanced view that questions the top-down model of state formation by princes and the bottom-up model of representation. The hypothesis posits a decentralization of legal authority, leading to a \"states within states\" model. Case studies from Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire will be employed to explore variables such as state formation, urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent. Utilizing an innovative path-dependency analytical framework, this research aims to improve the social history of power and reframe our understanding of state formation in Western Europe. The project will incorporate methodological innovations and integrate insights from central and Eastern Europe, offering a more comprehensive perspective on this critical period in European history."
