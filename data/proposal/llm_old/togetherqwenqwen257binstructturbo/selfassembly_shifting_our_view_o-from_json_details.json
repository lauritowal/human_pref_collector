        "Title: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal outlines a novel approach to understanding life through the lens of self-assembly processes, aiming to revolutionize our current understanding in biology, nanoscience, chemistry, material science, and the philosophy of science. AssemblingLife seeks to develop a new theoretical framework that shifts the paradigm of genetic causation, viewing genes as 'nudgers' rather than direct controllers. This project will explore the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structures without external guidance, providing a new theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes. By integrating insights across multiple disciplines, AssemblingLife aims to offer transformative conceptual tools that will shift the scientific and philosophical views of life. The potential impact of this research includes not only advancing our understanding in empirical life sciences but also providing robust theoretical foundations for philosophical inquiry into the nature of life itself."
