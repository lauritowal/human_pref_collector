        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Inference in Microeconometric Models,\" aims to develop advanced inference methods for econometric models with unobserved heterogeneity, particularly by leveraging longitudinal data. The project will focus on three key areas: enhancing inference methods for nonlinear models, estimating models for network data, and non-parametrically estimating dynamic discrete-choice models. By focusing on these areas, the project seeks to improve statistical hypothesis tests, apply network data as panel data, and incorporate unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables. The applications of these advancements include labor force participation and the import and export behavior of firms and countries. Both theoretical and simulation assessments will be conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Unobserved differences among economic agents significantly influence various economic outcomes, making this research crucial for understanding and predicting behaviors in labor markets and international trade."
