        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, LABFLEX, aims to investigate the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization and technological change. The project will address critical questions about the division of resources in society, focusing on wage inequality and gender wage gaps, and the role of labor market policies and institutions. LABFLEX will employ a multi-faceted approach, including the linking of register data to experimental evidence on worker preferences, analysis of full-text corpus of job vacancies with detailed attribute information, and the integration of experimental and structural methods. The project will provide new evidence on how job contract differences reflect worker preferences or technology advances, the impacts of flexibility on wage inequality, and the compensations for adverse work conditions or income risks. By drawing a detailed picture of the supply and demand sides of the labor market, LABFLEX will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics driving workplace transformation and offer insights into the role of labor market policies in addressing the division of resources in society."
