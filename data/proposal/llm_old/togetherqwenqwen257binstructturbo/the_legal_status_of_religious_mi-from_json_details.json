        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the legal status of religious minorities in the Euro-mediterranean world during the 5th to 16th centuries, a critical period in the development of religious pluralism and its legal frameworks. The project aims to collect, publish, and study legal texts that define the status of Christian, Muslim, and other religious minorities, including Roman law, canon law, national or royal law, urban law, rabbinical responsa, and fatwa collections. Key sources such as Theodosius Code, Justinian Code, Acta of Church councils, Decretum attributed to Gratian, Decretales, Barbarian law codes, Siete Partidas, Fueros, Hisba manuals, and others will be analyzed. The project will produce a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, workshops, an international conference, comparative thematic studies, proceedings, a sourcebook of selected legal texts, and a monograph. These outputs will serve as a major reference tool for scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations, encouraging collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. The target audience includes scholars and researchers in the Euro-mediterranean region and beyond, aiming to enhance understanding of the legal frameworks governing religious minorities in this period."
