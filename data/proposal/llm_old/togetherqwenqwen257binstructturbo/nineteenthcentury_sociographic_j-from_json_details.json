        "Title: Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge\n\nThis project is the first comprehensive study exploring nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as foundational to the development of social science. By analyzing a rich corpus of social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America, this research will produce a series of essays, a public exhibition, and a volume of collected essays. Two monographs will delve into the representational techniques of sociographic journalism, their connection with epistemic developments, and the embeddedness of journalistic sketches in socio-spatial settings. This study will examine the relations of these journalistic sketches to academic, artistic, and governmental projects, situating them against the backdrop of urbanization, cultural transfer, and nation-building. Through an anthropological and historiographical approach, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the formation of ethnographic and sociological knowledge in the nineteenth century."
