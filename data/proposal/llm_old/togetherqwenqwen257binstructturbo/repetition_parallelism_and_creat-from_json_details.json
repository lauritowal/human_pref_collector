        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Repetition, Parallelism and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\" (Project Identifier: REPAC), aims to explore the intricate relationship between textual form and function in Mesopotamian literature and scholarly compositions dating from the first millennium BCE. Focusing on genres such as literary, magical, and mantic texts inscribed on clay tablets in Akkadian, cuneiform script, the project delves into the use of repetition (exact and variant), parallelism, refrains, and ring composition as key structuring devices. By examining how these features contribute to poetic creativity, rhetorical effectiveness, and argumentation inventiveness, the study seeks to uncover the scribes' worldview, emphasizing interconnection, causal effectiveness, and the use of analogy. This research addresses a significant knowledge gap in understanding Mesopotamian literary and scholarly methods, aiming to enhance our appreciation of their creative efforts and the underlying logic of their textual constructions."
