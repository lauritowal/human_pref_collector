        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant seeks to explore the transformative impact of social network sites (SNS) on news organizations and citizens' political behavior. The project, titled \"The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organizations and Citizens' Political Behavior,\" aims to understand the process by which SNS are reshaping news production and consumption. The research will adopt innovative approaches including big data analysis, small-N in-depth designs, and laboratory observations, to reveal the implications of this transition. Key aspects include interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, content analysis, and the measurement of surfing behavior and physiological attention indices among users. Long-term political effects will be measured through survey panel data and web-based behavioral data over a two-year period. The project will provide novel conceptualizations of news distribution, consumption, and influence, and establish new methodological standards in audience research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolving media landscape and its societal impacts."
