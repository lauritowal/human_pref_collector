        "Title: Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination\n\nThis grant proposal aims to develop an innovative ecological model to study violence and its representation, focusing on how cultural expressions reflect ecoviolence. Through a comparative, transnational analysis integrating cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, the project will document representations of ecoviolence, mapping links between ecoviolence, colonialism, and genocide. It will analyze reflections on guilt, responsibility, and culture's involvement in environmental violence, exploring how representations harness affect and emotion for critical self-reflection. The project will reorient cultural memory research and ecocriticism to consider more-than-human terms, producing a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for engaging with these representations in pedagogy. This work will provide a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms, contributing to a deeper understanding of the cultural imagination's role in environmental crises."
