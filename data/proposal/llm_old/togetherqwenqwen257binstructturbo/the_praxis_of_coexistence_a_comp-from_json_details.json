        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines \"The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity,\" a research program addressing the complex issue of ethno-religious coexistence across Europe, the United States, India, and Israel. The program adopts a novel empirical, inductive, and comparative approach to understand spontaneous coexistence practices and the resources communities draw upon to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. By focusing on ordinary coexistence in diverse communities, the project aims to open a theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence, taking culture and existing practices into account for addressing diversity dilemmas. The objectives include achieving better policy through an empirical study, enlightening community expectations for coexistence, and exploring the resources used to foster peaceful coexistence. This comparative, inductive approach will generate insights into how different communities manage diversity, contributing to a deeper understanding of coexistence practices and their potential for policy development."
