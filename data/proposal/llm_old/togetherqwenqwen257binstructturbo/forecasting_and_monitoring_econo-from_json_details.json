        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding from the European Research Council (ERC) for a Proof of Concept grant under the title \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators.\" Building upon the success of our previous grant (ERC-2007-StG, Change-Point Tests), we propose to develop a novel software/toolbox for forecasting and monitoring economic indicators. This project aims to enhance current-state-of-art methods by incorporating real-time monitoring, predictive breakdown tests, and a novel model family that utilizes high-frequency information. Our toolbox will feature user-friendly software, three-dimensional graphical representation, and enhanced accessibility to decision makers, including governments, Central Banks, and firms. Initial collaborations with forecasting agencies and Central Banks have been established, ensuring a robust development process. The goal is to improve economic forecasts and decision-making, thereby contributing to prudent economic policy, economic growth, and overall economic and social welfare."
