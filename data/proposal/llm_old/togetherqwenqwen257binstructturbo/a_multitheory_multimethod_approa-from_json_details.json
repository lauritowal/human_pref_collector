        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence,\" seeks to address the critical challenge of violent extremism within the United Nations' Decade of Action (2020-2030). The project identifies significant theoretical, empirical, and methodological shortcomings in current research on radicalization, including poor consensus on its nature and causes, infrequent access to populations at risk, and reliance on qualitative data that hinders causal testing and comparative studies. To tackle these issues, the project is structured into four work packages: developing a multi-theory model for radicalization and deradicalization (WP1), innovating data collection methods (WP2), examining radicalization mechanisms in 10 nations (WP3), and creating evidence-based prevention and deradicalization programs (WP4). The project involves collaboration across diverse nations, including Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, and others, to collect unique empirical data and provide novel strategies for predicting and preventing violent extremism. This research promises to significantly enhance our scientific understanding and contribute practical tools to global efforts to combat violent extremism."
