        "Title: Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and Their Continental Neighbours\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal seeks to undertake the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations in Britain, spanning 800 BC to AD 100. The project, titled \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and Their Continental Neighbours,\" aims to explore the complex social, demographic, and cultural dynamics of Iron Age communities through a multi-disciplinary approach, including ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological methods. The research will focus on mapping genetic clusters, addressing population movement, and exploring inter-regional connectivity, with a particular emphasis on social dynamics, household compositions, familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities.\n\nThe study will analyze approximately 1000 individuals from Britain and 250 from wider Europe, providing unprecedented insights into Iron Age communities. Our team of experts, with backgrounds in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modeling, and cultural archaeology, is well-equipped to deliver significant advancements in our understanding of Iron Age European archaeology. The expected outcomes will offer a new vision of Iron Age communities, serving as a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond. This project not only advances our knowledge of ancient societies but also contributes to broader archaeological methodologies and interpretations."
