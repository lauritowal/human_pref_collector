        "This grant proposal outlines the project STUDACT, which aims to enhance global citizenship education (GCE) by understanding and fostering its appropriation among students. The project targets transformative education systems to empower learners and build inclusive societies, in alignment with UN SDG target 4.7 by 2030. Existing research highlights challenges in GCE development, particularly focusing on teachers' readiness and inconsistencies in theoretical approaches. However, there is a lack of systematic baseline data on student understanding and appropriation of GCE. STUDACT hypothesizes that students' engagement with GCE varies based on personal traits and context. The project will conduct data collection in six countries—Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK—using methods such as group discussions, Photovoice activism, and social media analysis. The research will analyze policies and curricula at various governance levels, addressing questions on how students from different backgrounds understand GCE, how they appropriate it, and how these understandings differ across countries, contexts, and student characteristics. STUDACT seeks to treat students as core partners and agentic participants in the research process."
