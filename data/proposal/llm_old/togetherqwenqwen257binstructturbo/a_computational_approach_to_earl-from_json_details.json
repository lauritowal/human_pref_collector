        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of early language acquisition through a computational approach, focusing on the critical period of infancy. The project, titled \"A computational approach to early language bootstrapping,\" aims to develop a model simulating the early language acquisition process in infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months. This model will be tested on speech databases in Japanese, French, and Dutch, and validated through infant behavioral and neurological studies, including EEGs and fNIRS.\n\nThe project encompasses four subprojects: defining coding features for speech, word segmentation in raw speech, a predictive model of coarticulation, and iteratively integrating approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules. Machine Learning and Automatic Speech Recognition will be central to these subprojects, with the goal of creating a robust model that can predict and explain early language development. Comparative analysis will be conducted against state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers, and the model's predictions will be tested using both artificial languages and a longitudinal study.\n\nThis interdisciplinary approach, combining computational modeling with empirical studies, will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the initial stages of language learning in infants, contributing significantly to both computational linguistics and developmental psychology."
