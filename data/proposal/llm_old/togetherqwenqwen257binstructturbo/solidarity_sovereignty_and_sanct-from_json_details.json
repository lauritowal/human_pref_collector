        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the global history of boat refugees since the 1940s, focusing on significant migration events such as Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean (1940s), Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea (1970s-1980s), and Cubans and Haitians in the Caribbean (1980s-1990s), among others. The project aims to investigate how the concepts of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary shaped the experiences and reception of these migrants across different periods and geographical locations, including the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean. Central to this research is the examination of who provided aid and who imposed restrictions, and the reasons behind these actions.\n\nKey research questions include the nature of solidarity among boat refugees onboard and from non-state actors, the responses of states to these journeys at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary after the perilous journeys. The project will analyze historical patterns through a comparative lens, emphasizing the significance of thinking through seas and moving beyond the state-centric framework. To achieve these goals, the study will utilize a variety of sources, including interviews with refugees and non-state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage. This comprehensive approach will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding boat refugees, offering insights that can inform current and future policies and practices in this field."
