        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the causal effects of public policy and economic shocks on child health and human capital development during the \"missing middle\" period from birth to age 15 in Spain. Utilizing a large, longitudinal dataset spanning 35 years, the study will employ advanced econometric techniques to explore the impacts of various interventions and shocks on child development. Key areas of focus include household material resources, parental time allocation, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks. The research will examine outcomes such as hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. By understanding the potential channels through which these factors influence development, including family size, parental time use, and expenditure patterns, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of public policies and economic conditions on child health and human capital. The findings will inform evidence-based policy-making and contribute to addressing health and educational disparities in Spain."
