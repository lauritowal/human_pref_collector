        "This grant proposal seeks to reevaluate the pivotal role of French as a supralocal, transnational language in European society between 1100 and 1450. The project, titled \"The Values of French Language and Literature in the European Middle Ages,\" aims to explore the relationship between language and identity during this period. Key research questions include the relation between language and identity and the demarcation of cognate languages. The project will focus on the multilingual context of the Middle Ages, particularly the coexistence of Latin and French. It seeks to foster collaboration among scholars from Europe and North America, employing various methodologies including codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology. The empirical research will center on the textual tradition of \"L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César,\" aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of the linguistic identity in Europe. The ultimate goal is to interrogate the role of French in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages, contributing to our understanding of the historical development of linguistic and cultural identity in Europe."
