        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"Forced Migration and Development,\" seeks to address the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, focusing on the largest refugee inflows and climate-induced internal displacement. With over 68.5 million displaced individuals, 85% hosted by developing nations, the project—referred to as FORCEDMIGDEV—aims to analyze the economic impacts of these crises. Our research will delve into the distributional and welfare effects of refugee inflows, specifically through the development and estimation of a structural model for Syrian refugees in Turkey, addressing questions about the distributional and welfare effects across regions and the influence of legal status on refugees. Additionally, we will explore the intersection between climate and development economics by combining reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement in Brazil. This project will develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-run effects of internal displacement, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of forced migration's economic implications in developing countries."
