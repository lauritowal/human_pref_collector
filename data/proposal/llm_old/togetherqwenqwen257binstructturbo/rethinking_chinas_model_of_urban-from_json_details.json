        "This grant proposal, titled \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance,\" holds world-historical significance in exploring the intricate dynamics of urban development and governance in China. Addressing both theoretical and policy challenges, the project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of state entrepreneurialism in China's urbanization process. By investigating neighborhoods, cities, and regions, the project employs ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers. Case studies include Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, representing coastal, central, and western regions. The project is timely, aligning with the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and responding to trade tensions. Contributions to theory include entrepreneurial urban governance, and indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation. Outputs include six workshops and a publication series, significantly advancing our understanding of China’s unique urban governance model."
