        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the intricate dynamics of human-environment interaction in the ancient Near East, specifically within the Fertile Crescent, from 8000 to 2000 years Before Present (BP). The Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society (CLaSS) project employs a hybrid research approach, integrating archaeological settlement data, archaeobotanical data, and climate model projections, particularly General Circulation Models (GCMs). Utilizing advanced techniques such as archaeological data science and big data analysis, the project aims to construct comprehensive empirical datasets. The research focuses on understanding population densities, distribution patterns, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies. The overarching goal is to investigate the factors that contributed to the differential persistence of societies under varying climatic conditions. This interdisciplinary approach promises valuable insights into the sustainability, resilience, and adaptive strategies of ancient societies in response to abrupt and longer-term climate changes, thereby enriching our understanding of societal evolution in the face of environmental challenges."
