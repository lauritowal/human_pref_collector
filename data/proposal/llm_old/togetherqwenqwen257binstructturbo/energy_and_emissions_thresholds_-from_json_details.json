        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Energy and emissions thresholds for providing decent living standards to all,\" aims to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts necessary to ensure decent living standards globally. The research explores what constitutes 'decent living standards' and the energy resources required to meet these standards in various countries, with a specific focus on five emerging economies. The project will operationalize basic needs through empirical validation and lifecycle and input-output analysis to assess the energy and climate impacts of these needs. Integrated assessment models will be used to map energy consumption to climate change, while an analysis of path dependencies and trends in basic goods will identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies. The study seeks to develop knowledge on energy needs, analyze climate impacts, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation, thereby contributing to sustainable development goals."
