        "Title: Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms (MERLIT)\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive research project titled \"Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms\" (MERLIT), which aims to provide a systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation of meritocratic narratives in literature. The project seeks to explore the practices of writing that shape both meritocratic articulations and critiques, with a particular emphasis on expanding the contextual focus to include Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. By engaging with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, MERLIT aims to address existing research gaps, such as the lack of investigations into formal principles, the narrow focus on Western contexts, and the concentration on recent developments. The project is structured into six work packages that integrate literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation, fostering an interdisciplinary approach. MERLIT will offer a literary history of meritocratic thought, advance understanding of hegemonic forms in writing, and highlight literature's worldmaking role. As the first project of its kind, MERLIT promises to contribute significantly to the global relevance of literary studies by addressing critiques of meritocracy's entanglement with structures of domination and privilege."
