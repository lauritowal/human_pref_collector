        "The research proposal, titled \"HISTORICAL ROOTS OF CONFLICT AND DEVELOPMENT: FROM PREHISTORY TO THE COLONIZATION EXPERIENCE,\" seeks to elucidate the enduring impact of historical events on current conflict and economic development. The project is divided into two parts. Part 1 focuses on the effects of historical colonization on conflict and economic development in Latin America, utilizing administrative data from the initial colonizers (1492-1599). The analysis, conducted within-country, examines the interaction between human capital and institutional structures, providing insights into how these factors influence ongoing conflict and economic outcomes. Part 2 explores the long-term dynamics of conflict by constructing a dataset based on archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts, to understand their influence on contemporary conflict patterns in various regions. This interdisciplinary approach, combining historical and archaeological data with modern economic analysis, aims to uncover the deep-rooted causes of current conflicts and economic disparities. The research will contribute to a better understanding of the historical roots of development challenges and the potential pathways for conflict resolution and sustainable economic growth in regions with complex historical legacies."
