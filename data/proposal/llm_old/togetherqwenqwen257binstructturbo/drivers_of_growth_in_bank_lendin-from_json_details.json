        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant seeks to investigate the drivers of credit growth and their impact on banking crises, a critical issue in the global financial landscape. The project, titled \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to empirically identify and estimate the individual impacts of financial innovations, such as loan securitization and mortgage lending, on credit growth. Key phenomena include a strong credit growth pattern preceding financial crises, which aligns with the current consensus to tighten financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension. However, the existing evidence is insufficient to provide decisive empirical insights, particularly due to the complexity of the global banking system and the scarcity of micro-level data.\n\nOur project addresses this gap by leveraging exceptional micro-level datasets to analyze the impact of each critical ingredient, including lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios, on credit growth. A robust theoretical framework will be provided where necessary, and we will assess potential interactions among ingredients, ensuring external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies. Our approach offers a comprehensive analysis to inform policy decisions and improve the resilience of financial systems."
