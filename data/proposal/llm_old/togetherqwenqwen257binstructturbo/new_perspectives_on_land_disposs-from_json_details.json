        "This grant proposal, titled \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict, and Migration in the West African Sahel,\" aims to investigate the complex interplay between land dispossession and violent resistance among farmers and pastoralists in Mali, a key country in the West African Sahel. The project employs a mixed-methods approach grounded in political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies to explore the hypothesized relationship between land dispossession, elite capture, violent jihadist resistance, and migration. By examining why some smallholders resist violently while others remain compliant, the project seeks to provide novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, as well as practical ideas for policy formulation. This research is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate violent conflict and promote sustainable development in a region facing significant socio-economic challenges."
