    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the development of Buddhism in the region of Greater Gandhāra (comprising present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India) during the first millennium CE through the analysis of textual material in Indic languages. The project focuses on recent discoveries from the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand, with a particular emphasis on Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts. Utilizing philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methodologies, the study aims to trace the textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of these manuscripts. The outputs of this research will include a digital archive, an akṣara database, digital preservation efforts, editions, and translations of the manuscripts, as well as feature studies on their textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. Comparative content analysis across multiple languages will further enrich our understanding of this period's rich textual and cultural heritage."
