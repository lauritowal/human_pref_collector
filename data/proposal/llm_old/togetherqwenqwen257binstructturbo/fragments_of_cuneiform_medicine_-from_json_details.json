        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal outlines the establishment of the \"BabMed\" project, a groundbreaking study into the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as reflected in the Aramaic texts of the Babylonian Talmud. This project aims to be the first comprehensive analysis of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform, addressing the significant gap in our understanding of this period. The project hypothesizes that cuneiform medicine survived much longer than previously suspected and that the Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud is largely derived from Akkadian medicine. By employing native taxonomies and comparing Babylonian medical practices with those of neighboring regions and Greek medicine, BabMed seeks to challenge prevalent Eurocentric historical narratives. This research will provide a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer in Late Antiquity. Overcoming the barriers posed by script and language, BabMed will leverage the unique text of the Babylonian Talmud, which preserves Babylonian medicine in the context of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia. This study will offer valuable insights into the scientific thinking of both worlds and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of ancient medical practices."
