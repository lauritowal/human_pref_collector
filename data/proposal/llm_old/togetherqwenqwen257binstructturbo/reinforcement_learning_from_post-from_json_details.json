        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal aims to investigate the post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior, focusing on its dopaminergic substrate and neural activity in brain reward circuits. We hypothesize that the selection of food is influenced by post-ingestive information about energy content, modulated by sensory feedback and vagus nerve transmission. Using a multi-faceted approach, including computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation in rodents and humans, we will explore the role of post-ingestive information in driving food consumption. Specifically, our experiments will include human decision-making tasks and examine conditions such as obesity. This study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of food intake, with implications for understanding and treating conditions like obesity."
