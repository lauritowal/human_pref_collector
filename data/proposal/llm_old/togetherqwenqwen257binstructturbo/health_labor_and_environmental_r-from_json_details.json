        "Title: Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to enhance our understanding of the economic and social impacts of environmental regulation in post-industrial Europe, with a particular focus on air quality and labor market dynamics. The project aims to provide empirical evidence to inform climate and air quality policy-making by integrating causal inference on pollution emissions with chemical transport models and incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates. This interdisciplinary approach will develop new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, focusing on the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (Part I) and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration (Part II). The project prioritizes environmental quality improvement in response to global climate change and increasing public demand for better environmental conditions. By addressing these key origins of regulated pollution (primarily the combustion of fossil fuels), the research seeks a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus."
