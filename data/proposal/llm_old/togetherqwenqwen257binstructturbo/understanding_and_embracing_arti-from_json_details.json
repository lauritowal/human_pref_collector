        "**Abstract**\n\nThe proposed project, \"F-AI-MILY: Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents’ Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families,\" seeks to investigate the influence of artificial agents on family social dynamics. This interdisciplinary study integrates knowledge from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction to establish a novel group-centered mobile-lab approach for studying family neurocognition. The objectives include describing developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents and identifying sustainable interactions that can support households with chronic illness. The project will develop a group-centered mobile lab to measure behavioral and brain measures of family attitudes and behaviors, test child development interaction with artificial agents, and examine long-term effects on families with children aged 4-12. This research aims to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, and to facilitate the development of artificial agents that support vulnerable households, thereby changing maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness. The neurocognition-at-home approach and full-circle methodology ensure a comprehensive understanding and application of findings."
