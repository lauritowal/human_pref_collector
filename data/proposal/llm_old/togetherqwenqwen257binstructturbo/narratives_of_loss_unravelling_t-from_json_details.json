        "This grant proposal, titled \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,\" aims to explore how economic hardship influences support for far-right parties and socially conservative agendas in five European countries (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). The project seeks to fill a significant knowledge gap by investigating why financial crises correlate with increased support for far-right parties. Drawing on political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioural economics, we hypothesize that economic hardship leads to narratives of loss, which in turn drive support for social conservatism. Our multi-method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, will examine how local and national policy contexts shape these narratives. This comparative study across countries with varying levels of economic hardship compensation aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms linking economic distress to political polarization."
