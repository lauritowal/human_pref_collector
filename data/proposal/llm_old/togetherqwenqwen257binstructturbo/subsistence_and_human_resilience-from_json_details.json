        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the subsistence and human resilience strategies of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Southern European peninsulas. Spanning 20 archaeological sites, this project employs zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope analyses to assess behavioral flexibility and resilience in response to sudden climatic events. Key objectives include reconstructing local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions and developing a method to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity. By studying Neanderthals and AMH, we aim to understand subsistence patterns that may have favored AMH colonization and contributed to Neanderthal extinction. This pan-European study will provide critical insights into prehistoric human adaptation and resilience to climatic change, enhancing our understanding of the complexities of this pivotal period in human prehistory."
