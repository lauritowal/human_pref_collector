        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal focuses on the increasing wage inequality in industrialized countries over the past decades, with a specific emphasis on intra-firm and inter-firm wage disparities and persistent gender gaps. Leveraging four decades of German social security records, survey data, and administrative data, this project will analyze the multifaceted influences of market forces, government policies, and firm-specific practices on wage inequality and gender gaps. \n\nProject A will examine how product market competition and routine-biased technological changes affect the selection, reallocation, and differential wage growth within firms. Project B will explore the impacts of minimum wage introduction and changes in business tax rates on these same factors. Project C will investigate the effects of family-friendly policies, flexible working times, and child care facilities on mothers' return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories post-childbirth, while also considering the influence of co-workers' presence and gender attitudes within the firm environment. The comprehensive analysis aims to provide a nuanced understanding of wage inequality dynamics and inform policy interventions to mitigate such inequalities."
