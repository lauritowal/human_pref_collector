        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World,\" which aims to explore the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity during the early modern period (1500-1750). This transnational project, led by a principal investigator and involving a team of multiple researchers, will utilize a wide array of source materials from three continents, covering ten languages, and drawing from dozens of archives. The project's analytical framework is rooted in linking macro-narratives of global history with micro-scale everyday life, employing methodologies such as philology and source criticism. \n\nThe project will cover subjects ranging from Middle Eastern history to European and global contexts, with a focus on Eastern Christians who migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. Key outcomes include publications, workshops, and the development of a searchable database to facilitate research. The dissemination strategy aims to reach both academic and broader public audiences, ensuring the project's findings are accessible and impactful. This innovative research not only enriches our understanding of early modern history but also celebrates the resilience and connectivity of Eastern Christian communities across the globe."
