        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a groundbreaking project, \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aimed at developing and testing innovative digital methods for the creation and curation of historical data, specifically for medieval history. The project will re-frame historical data as assertions linked to an authoritative framework, enabling manipulation of data according to its source and authority. This approach acknowledges the complexity of pre-modern history, where few undisputed facts exist, by allowing for the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict. The primary focus is on the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095) in the Eastern half of Christendom and newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The project seeks to examine trans-regional trends that are often obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom. By contextualising and reusing existing online data to prevent waste, the project will integrate prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology to provide a more comprehensive and traceable historical narrative. The goal is to view history from multiple perspectives, offering a nuanced understanding of the period through a robust, digitally informed framework. This multidisciplinary approach promises to significantly enhance our comprehension of the eleventh century, a pivotal era in European history."
