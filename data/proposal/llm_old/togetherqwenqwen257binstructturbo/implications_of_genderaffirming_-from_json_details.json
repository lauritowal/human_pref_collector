        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the biopsychosocial implications of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) for psychosocial functioning and social relationship experiences among transgender people. The research, grounded in the biopsychosocial model and employing a variety of novel and cutting-edge methods, is situated at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare. Key concerns include the high social disruption rates and elevated suicide risks faced by this population. The project will isolate causal pathways linking GAHT to psychosocial functioning, empower transgender individuals to share their personal and relational experiences, and guide policy and practice for gender identity services. With a focus on informed consent and outcomes that include improvements in psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes, this comprehensive study will contribute significantly to the field of transgender health. The four work packages are designed to address the research questions rigorously, ensuring that the findings will have a meaningful impact on the health and well-being of transgender people."
