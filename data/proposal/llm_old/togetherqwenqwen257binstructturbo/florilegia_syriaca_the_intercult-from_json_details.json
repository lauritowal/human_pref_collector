        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to illuminate the transformative dissemination of Greek Christian thought within Syriac and Christian Arabic cultures during the first millennium CE, focusing on the period from the 2nd to the 11th centuries. The project, titled \"Florilegia Syriaca,\" aims to redefine the religious identity of Syriac Christians and fill a significant gap in current knowledge by producing open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th to the 10th centuries. Through the compilation of anthologies of writings by Syriac and Christian Arabic authors, this project will explore the cultural mediation of Greek Christian thought, serving as a vital cultural laboratory and a bridge between the intellectual histories of Europe and the Middle East. The groundbreaking endeavor includes the creation of digital editions of these texts, which are crucial for understanding the shared cultural heritage and religious discourses between European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures. This research will enhance our understanding of cultural dynamics in Late Antiquity, the role of patristic Christianity in shaping intellectual history, and the preservation of endangered cultural heritage, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive comprehension of contemporary religious discourses."
