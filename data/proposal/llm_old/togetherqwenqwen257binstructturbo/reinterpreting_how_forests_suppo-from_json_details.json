        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address the critical issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting approximately 2 billion people in low-income countries, by reinterpreting the role of forests in supporting dietary quality. The proposed project, titled \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries,\" aims to fill the blind spot of the current conceptualization of food security, which primarily focuses on increasing agricultural production and access to calories. Instead, we will explore the multifaceted benefits of forests, including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which play a significant role in dietary diversification. Using a multi-scale, multi-country, data-rich approach, the project will identify the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, develop a framework on forest-diet linkages, and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary outcomes. The methodology will include broad-scale perspectives to explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes, hotspot identification by linking household food consumption data with forest metrics, and in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations. The project will conduct fieldwork in two strategic locations to ensure robust data collection and analysis. The outcomes will contribute significantly to a shift in food security conceptualization, highlighting the critical role of forests in enhancing dietary quality and addressing nutrient deficiencies."
