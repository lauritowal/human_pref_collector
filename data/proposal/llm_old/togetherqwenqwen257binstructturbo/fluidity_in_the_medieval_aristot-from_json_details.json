        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive investigation into new ways to read the Latin translations of Aristotle, titled \"Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations.\" The project focuses on the late medieval to early modern period, examining hundreds of manuscript witnesses for textual variance. Key Aristotle treatises, including De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo, will be critically edited. Through the research method of documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses, the project aims to develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science. This study addresses the importance of textual fluidity in manuscripts, providing evidence of how readers were exposed to recently available translations that fundamentally differed from the Greek originals. The project spans the 12th and 13th centuries, impacting philosophy, science, and theology. This research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the transmission and reception of Aristotle's works in medieval and early modern contexts."
