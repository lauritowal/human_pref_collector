        "Title: Classical Influences and Irish Culture\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the unique and underexplored history of Irelandâ€™s engagement with ancient Greece and Rome, a tradition that has significantly shaped its literary, social, and political discourse. We hypothesize that this engagement, while Ireland was not part of the Roman Empire, has left a distinct imprint on its cultural landscape. The research will focus on nine thematic areas: language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence. Utilizing a multi-thematic heuristic framework, this project will engage in a dialogue between classical reception studies and Irish/English-language literature, medieval and postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, and women's studies, with a particular emphasis on the contemporary preoccupations of politics and history, especially the centenary commemorations of the Irish independence movement (1912-1922) and the ongoing violence in Northern Ireland. This study is expected to open new avenues of investigation, revealing the lasting impact of classical culture on Irish literary and social discourse, extending beyond the past 100 years."
