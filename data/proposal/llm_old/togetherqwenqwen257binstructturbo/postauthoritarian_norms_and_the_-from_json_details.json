        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the enduring impact of past authoritarian regimes on political norms in new democracies, focusing on Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe. The project will examine how voters and parties avoid associating with the ideologies of past dictatorships, and how this rejection shapes political competition and national identity. Survey experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that the ideological legacy of authoritarianism significantly influences political positions. The research aims to contribute a new theory explaining political competition heterogeneity across new democracies, with expected outputs including insights into left-wing party decline in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the high likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. This study promises to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between historical legacies and contemporary political dynamics."
