        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the development of FARE_AUDIT: an innovative auditing system designed to understand and mitigate the spread of disinformation through search engines. The primary objective is to investigate how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation. FARE_AUDIT will include an advanced auditing tool for search engines, privacy-protecting web-crawlers, and a mechanism that simulates diverse user online profiles to breach information bubbles. By employing fingerprinting rather than cookie-tracking, FARE_AUDIT ensures user privacy while providing a critical tool for democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify and respond to new disinformation in near real-time. The project aims to increase public awareness of search engines' role in spreading disinformation and equip organizations with the necessary tools for effective disinformation detection and monitoring. This initiative represents a significant shift from traditional methods, offering a more robust and privacy-focused approach to combating the spread of disinformation online."
