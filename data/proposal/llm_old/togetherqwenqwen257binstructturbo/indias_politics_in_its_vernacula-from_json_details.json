        "Title: \"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\"\n\nThis grant seeks to fill a critical knowledge gap in understanding the conceptual foundations of India's political life. As the world's largest democracy and a rising global power, India's political engagement is deeply rooted in vernacular languages, yet remains understudied. The project will employ an ethnographic and historical approach to develop an empirical and analytical lexicography of India's political life, focusing on vernacular languages. A collaborative effort involving anthropologists, historians, linguists, and political scholars, it aims to create an open-access online Concept Laboratory for Indian political languages. This initiative will explore the implications for global political theory, drawing parallels with European political ideas. By examining demotic political ideas, the project will contribute to the study of subcontinental politics, offer methodological insights beyond Europe, and advance global political theory."
