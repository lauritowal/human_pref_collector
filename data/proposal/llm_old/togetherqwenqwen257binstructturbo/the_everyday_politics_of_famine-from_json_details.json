        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe Everyday Politics of Famine is a critical ethnographically-informed comparative study exploring the persistence and normalization of deadly famines in South Sudan and Somalia. Despite a significant 35 million people on the brink of famine in 2022, with 250,000 people already experiencing famine conditions, the underlying socio-political dynamics remain underexplored. This project aims to understand why famines persist and how they are politicized, shifting the focus from structural causes to everyday politics. \n\nThrough a multi-faceted approach, the research will delve into histories and musical memories of past famines, community-narratives that reinforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. The study will be conducted by a Somali and South Sudanese-dominated research team, leveraging their previous experience, networks, and carefully built capacity. The research will highlight the normalization of famines and the displacement of blame, aiming to challenge prevailing narratives and contribute to a shift in the science of famine politics. This work is crucial for informing policy and intervention strategies to prevent and mitigate future famines."
