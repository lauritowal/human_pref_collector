        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae on Mood: From Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged,\" addresses the critical issue of insomnia's contribution to mood disorders, particularly in the elderly population. Prevalence rates of major depression and clinically significant depressive symptoms are 1-3% and 8-16%, respectively, with underdetection rates <20%. Treatment effectiveness for depression is moderate, underscoring the need for preventive interventions. Given the high prevalence of insomnia (up to 40%) in the elderly, which increases the risk of depression by 13%, this project aims to identify at-risk individuals through early detection and to optimize intervention protocols. Our approach involves subtype identification via multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging, supported by an interdisciplinary strategy. Key goals include creating subtype and mechanism profiles, and developing internet-supported home-applicable interventions focused on sleep improvement and depression prevention. This project is crucial for advancing our understanding and addressing the significant public health challenge of mood disorders in the aging population."
