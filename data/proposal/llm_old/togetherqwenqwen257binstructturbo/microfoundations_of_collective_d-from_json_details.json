        "This grant proposal seeks to initiate a groundbreaking research project titled \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence,\" aimed at exploring the underlying psychological and political mechanisms that shape public attitudes towards collective defence within key NATO member states. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach encompassing experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, the project will conduct an extensive, cross-national investigation focusing on the views of individuals regarding allied assistance in various collective defence scenarios. The research aims to develop a theoretical model that examines how strategic context influences public opinion, how individual attitudes aggregate to form collective beliefs, and how these opinions impact decision-making among allied states. Methodologically innovative, the project will employ novel immersive mixed-media experiments to create an interactive and realistic participant experience. This approach is expected to yield valuable insights into the stability and credibility of military alliances, potentially redefining the landscape of collective defence policies."
