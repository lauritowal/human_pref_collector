        "Title: Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas\n\nThis project, titled \"Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas,\" explores the complex intersections of theatre, national identity, and politics from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Utilizing a transdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic approach, the research focuses on specific case studies, including Armenian theatre after the Genocide, queer dramas, Islamic theatre in Turkey and abroad, Sephardic Jewish theatre, and Alevi theatre, both in Turkey and Europe. The primary objectives are to investigate the role of theatre in the constitution of 'the Turkish nation' and its Others, to provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government, and to explore the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. This research aims to advance understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe and to offer insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies. The project will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, contributing significantly to the fields of cultural studies, political science, and theatre."
