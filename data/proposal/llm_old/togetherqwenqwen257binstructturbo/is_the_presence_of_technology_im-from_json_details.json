        "This grant proposal, titled \"Is the Presence of Technology Improving Corporations and Increasing the Prosperity of Investors and Individuals?\" investigates the impact of technology on corporate governance and investor relations. The study aims to understand the shift from in-person to virtual-only shareholder meetings, focusing on whether this change has muted shareholders' voices and enabled firms to strategically avoid addressing critical issues. Additionally, the project will use natural language processing to evaluate the discrepancy between firms' stated and actual environmental and social (ES) actions, exploring how markets reward stated commitments over actual implementations. Lastly, the proposal will examine the relation between employees' characteristics, particularly gender in the tech industry, and their Economic Benefits Compensation (EBC), aiming to maximize EBC value in the evolving economic landscape. This research seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness of technology in enhancing corporate transparency and individual prosperity."
