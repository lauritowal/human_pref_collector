        "This grant proposal aims to explore the under-researched connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement, through the innovative lens of the \"real estate/financial complex.\" Initiated in 2007, the project seeks to bridge the gap in existing research by focusing on the qualitative and quantitative shifts within this complex system. The proposed research will employ a comparative international approach, with a particular emphasis on the global dimensions of the complex and the evolving role of states in these interactions.\n\nThe project will be led by a Principal Investigator (PI) who will focus on understanding the qualitative shift towards real estate and finance, the role of the state, and the conceptualization of the complex. Additionally, three PhD students will be involved, each tasked with completing national mappings of the complex and conducting local/urban case studies, covering a total of six countries. This collaborative research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the connections between real estate, finance, and states across different scales.\n\nThe proposed research is expected to contribute significantly to the academic and policy discourse by offering a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the real estate/financial complex, thereby enriching our understanding of urban development and financial systems."
