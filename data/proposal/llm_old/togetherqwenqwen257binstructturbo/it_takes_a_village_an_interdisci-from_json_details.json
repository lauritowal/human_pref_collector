        "Title: InterCom: An Interdisciplinary Community Neuroscience Approach to Characterize Multigenerational Interactions\n\nAbstract: This grant seeks to understand multi-generational communication by combining laboratory research with real-world experimentation, focusing on age-related differences in brain rhythms and speech processing. InterCom aims to investigate whether age-related brain rhythm differences inhibit conversational flow, how listeners process speech from children and older adults, and if intergenerational miscommunications are partly due to prediction errors. The project will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups during real-world storytelling events, co-designed with community partners. Data from these events will inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies, and vice versa. Our innovative approach leverages the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control, aiming to develop tools to improve intergenerational communication. By combining lab and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and analysis in a reciprocal manner, InterCom will generate insights and innovations to address challenges in multigenerational interactions."
