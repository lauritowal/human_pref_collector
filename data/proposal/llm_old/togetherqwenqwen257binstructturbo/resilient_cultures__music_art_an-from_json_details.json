        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong,\" aims to explore how cultural practices in these regions develop strategies to express social and political discontent under authoritarianism. The research focuses on popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema, employing a comparative analysis across indigenous and international contexts. Key regions of study include Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, with cultural fields such as indie music, folk music, art institutes, and socially engaged art projects. Methodological tools include ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research. The project will also facilitate networks in East Asia, Europe, and beyond, through workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions. Expected outcomes include a multivocal, diverse, and vibrant understanding of cultural production. Comparative contexts include Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, providing a rich framework to analyze resilience and critique under diverse authoritarian regimes."
