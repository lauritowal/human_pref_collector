        "**Abstract:**\n\nSynSig aims to delve into how interpersonal synchrony impacts mental health on an individual basis, challenging the conventional view that higher synchrony universally benefits mental health. This proposal seeks to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures, explore tailored corrections of these signatures, and analyze how adjustments in synchrony can transform relationships into curative ones. We will employ a multimodal approach, utilizing motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals interacting with both humans and virtual humans. Our methods include developing a first-of-its-kind multimodal feedback system for momentary deviations from synchrony signatures and facilitating individual-tailored changes in synchrony. Expected outcomes include evidence of unique synchrony signatures for each individual, insights into the multi-layered nature of individual synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. This project will contribute significantly to the field by providing a personalized framework for enhancing mental well-being through interpersonal synchrony."
