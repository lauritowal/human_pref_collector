        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change (PLAnT), a critical initiative aimed at addressing the urgent need for integrated marine spatial planning (MSP) in Antarctica. Given the absence of any existing MSP framework in the region and the high urgency due to rapid environmental changes, this project will focus on assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities, building future scenarios, supporting area-based climate action, and fostering a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity. The PLAnT project will include governance analyses and the provision of dynamic solutions that are specific to the unique contextual idiosyncrasies of the region, including political, social, and economic factors. By incorporating the critical effects of climate change into the planning process, the project aims to inspire nations to adopt more sustainable and equitable practices in ocean management, thereby contributing to the international agenda on ocean sustainability. This initiative has the potential to significantly influence global efforts towards sustainable ocean use and management."
