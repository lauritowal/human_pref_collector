        "The proposal, \"Cultural roots and institutional transformations of teachers’ careers and the teaching profession in Europe,\" seeks to address the low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages plaguing educational systems in Belgium, France, and England. This systematic comparative study employs a post-comparative mixed-method design, divided into work packages focusing on teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. The project draws on national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility, to conduct policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, and multilevel multi-group analyses. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with non-entrants and early leavers. The objectives are to explain the nature of teacher policies, understand the changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration. Expected outputs include new theoretical knowledge and a reconceptualization of institutional change, providing valuable insights into the future of European educational systems."
