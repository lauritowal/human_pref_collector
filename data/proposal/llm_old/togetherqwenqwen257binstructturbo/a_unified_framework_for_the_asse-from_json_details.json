        "This grant proposal seeks to develop a unified framework for the assessment and application of cognitive models, which are widely used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. The project addresses the proliferation of cognitive modeling ideas and techniques, idiosyncratic applications, and the unclear state-of-the-art in cognitive modeling. By leveraging Bayesian inference foundations, the project aims to assess the absolute and relative goodness-of-fit of various cognitive models, including drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. Efficient algorithms for parameter estimation will be explored, and diagnostics for model comparison using Bayes factors will be developed. The project will enhance the field by constructing plausible parameter priors, developing diagnostic experiments, and assessing parameter changes in hierarchical designs. A model-averaged assessment will also be provided. The outcome is expected to set a new standard for cognitive modeling, with techniques incorporated into JASP (jasp-stats.org) and made available for students, researchers, and practitioners."
