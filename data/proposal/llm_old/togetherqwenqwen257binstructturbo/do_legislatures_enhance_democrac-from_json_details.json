        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes, specifically whether these institutions can enhance democracy. The research question, \"Do legislatures in authoritarian countries have the potential to enhance democracy?\" is addressed through a mixed-methods design focusing on seven African countries. The project aims to investigate law-making, interaction patterns, political dialogue, representation, and constituency responsiveness. Theoretical views are drawn from the understanding that elections and multi-party systems in autocracies often prolong rather than transform them, and that successive multi-party elections may increase democratic advancement. Methodologically, the study will utilize content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys of national assemblies, and social network analysis, supported by process tracing. Data collection includes biographical, opinion, and social interaction data from national assemblies. A strong, interdisciplinary team from partner institutions in the countries under study will contribute to the collection of extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behavior in electoral autocracies, filling a significant gap in the literature. This project will provide crucial insights into the potential for legislatures to foster democratic development in Africa."
