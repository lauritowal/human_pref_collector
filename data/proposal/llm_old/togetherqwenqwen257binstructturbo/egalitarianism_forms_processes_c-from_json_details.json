        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project \"Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons,\" aimed at exploring the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, practices, and values across diverse cultural contexts. Utilizing both library-based global comparative studies and field ethnographic approaches, the project will decenter traditional orientations to understand the complexities of egalitarianism. Key research goals include integrating theoretical and empirical methodologies, developing a comparative method that is open to the variety of conceptions and circumstances, and addressing perennial questions such as the role of the state, religion, and economic distribution. The study will be conducted in Europe and other regions, focusing on the force, contradictions, and limitations inherent in egalitarian practices. This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of egalitarianism as a cultural value, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and enhancing our knowledge of its diverse manifestations and challenges."
