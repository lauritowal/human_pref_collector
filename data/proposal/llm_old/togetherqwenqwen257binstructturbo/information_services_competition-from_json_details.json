    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to foster a deeper understanding of the economics of information services through an exploration of strategic interactions, production, and exchange processes, with a particular focus on externalities. The project encompasses three key areas: theoretical background, empirical investigation, and policy implications. Part 1 delves into background theory, covering two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities. Part 2 examines the virtual layer, focusing on recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs, using proprietary data from e-commerce platforms for an empirical investigation. Part 3 explores the physical layer, investigating pricing and investment strategies, including studies on net-neutrality and data pricing. Part 4 addresses competition policy, particularly in the context of two-sided markets. The approach integrates the development of relevant theory, empirical investigation, and the creation of dynamic investment models. This project will provide unique insights into the role of externalities in information services, contributing to the knowledge base and informing competition policy makers."
