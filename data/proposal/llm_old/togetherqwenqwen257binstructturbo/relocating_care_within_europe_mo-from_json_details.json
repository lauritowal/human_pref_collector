        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to fund a multi-sited anthropological study titled \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the Elderly to Places Where Care Is More Affordable.\" The research explores the phenomenon of ageing bodies relocating to affordable care locations, a trend often referred to as \"grandmother deportation\" or \"geriatric colonialism,\" driven by the marketization of care and the entanglement of welfare states across borders. The study will focus on the case of elderly patients from Austria and Germany seeking care in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where costs are one-third of their home countries. Drawing on historical contexts, particularly German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, the research will investigate the labor migration, real estate investments, and state insurances underpinning this trend. Through in-depth ethnographic studies, the investigation will explore how care homes are managed by former migrant workers and international companies, and how these dynamics reflect broader issues of privatization in care landscapes. The project aims to understand the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and the implications of care relocation for what it means to become old and in need of care in an increasingly intertwined Europe. By addressing these issues, the research will contribute to a deeper understanding of future care scenarios and the challenges and opportunities they present."
