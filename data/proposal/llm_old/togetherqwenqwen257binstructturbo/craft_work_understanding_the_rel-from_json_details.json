        "Abstract:\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project proposes a multi-methodological, pan-European study that explores the evolving relationship between identity and work through the lens of neo-craft workers across various sectors within the EU. This project, titled \"Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work,\" seeks to develop a new interpretative framework for this relationship by focusing on the lived experiences, cultural practices, and perceptions of social status among neo-craft workers. Utilizing a combination of digital methods and qualitative research, CRAFTWORK aims to address the societal challenges posed by the future of work, offering a first comprehensive inquiry into this emerging form of work in the European context. This project innovates through its methodological approach, combining digital methods with traditional qualitative research, and theoretically by rethinking interpretative categories to better understand the complexities of identity and work in the digital age."
