        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"Structural Household Analysis Using Revealed Preferences.\" The project aims to advance the understanding of intrahousehold decision-making processes by integrating marriage market dynamics into structural modeling. Employing a non-unitary modeling approach, the project utilizes revealed preference theory with nonparametric estimation to analyze household consumption. The primary objectives are to open the \"intrahousehold black box\" using aggregate consumption data, avoid parametric assumptions on decision processes, and describe the intrahousehold decision process. The proposal addresses challenges such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions. It draws on pooled cross-section data sets for empirical analysis. By integrating theoretical and empirical methods, the project contributes to both the theoretical and applied economics literature, offering valuable insights into household consumption patterns and decision-making dynamics."
