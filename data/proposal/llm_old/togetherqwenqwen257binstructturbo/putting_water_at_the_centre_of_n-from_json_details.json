        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, \"NUCLEARWATERS: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History,\" seeks to fundamentally revise the conventional narratives of nuclear energy by framing it as a hydraulic technology deeply intertwined with centuries of water manipulation and management. This innovative project (Project Name: NUCLEARWATERS) investigates the historical water-manipulating technologies and risk conceptions, highlighting how nuclear energy's development and operation are inherently connected to water. By exploring themes such as the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the Soviet Union's unique approach to nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley's nuclearized river basin, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region, the project aims to uncover new insights and answer key riddles in nuclear energy history. This interdisciplinary approach, spanning the history of technology, environmental history, and public discourse, seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of nuclear energy's historical roots and implications. The project is structured into six work packages, ensuring a thorough and detailed examination of these themes. The ambition is to not only enrich academic discussions but also inform public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond."
