        "This grant proposal, titled \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56),\" aims to achieve a breakthrough in understanding the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by studying early Franciscan thought. The project challenges the prevailing assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past work, instead highlighting their innovative contributions. By implementing a 'practice-led' hermeneutic for reading scholastic texts, the project considers the influence of practice on theory. The objectives include producing the first comprehensive study of sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought, identifying novel elements in their work, including the use of Islamic sources, drawing connections between early and late Franciscan schools, and showcasing the shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity. The expected outcome is a nuanced scholarly account that will advance knowledge by re-envisioning the state of the art in the study of scholasticism. The project emphasizes how Franciscan ideas became modern when removed from their original practice-led context, offering a new perspective on their significance in the development of Western philosophy."
