        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities,\" aims to develop methodologies for analyzing unstructured texts within a GIS environment, thereby enhancing our understanding of spatial dynamics in human history and culture. With a background in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), the Principal Investigator (PI) will lead a collaborative effort involving experts in GIS, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History. The project focuses on two primary studies: the English Lake District before, during, and after the Romantic era, and the mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales, exploring socio-economic changes and political interventions. By integrating GIS and Corpus Linguistics, the research will uncover hidden spatial patterns in textual sources, which include ancient manuscripts, modern newspapers, and e-resources. The project will foster outreach through short courses, expert meetings, and a conference, ensuring the dissemination of findings and promoting interdisciplinary dialogue. This initiative is poised to make a significant impact within the humanities and beyond, advancing our comprehension of how spatial dimensions shape human narratives and societal transformations."
