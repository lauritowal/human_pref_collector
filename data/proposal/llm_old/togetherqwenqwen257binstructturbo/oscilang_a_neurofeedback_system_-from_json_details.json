        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"OsciLang: A Neurofeedback System Based on Oscillatory Activity for Diagnosis and Intervention in Language and Reading Impairments,\" aims to develop an affordable, lightweight, and wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) neurofeedback system. This system is designed to diagnose and intervene in language disorders, specifically targeting dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). The core mechanism of OsciLang involves synchronizing brain activity with changes in speech signals, leveraging the neurofeedback based on phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech. The research is grounded in the observation of reduced auditory tracking in the delta band in dyslexic readers. The expected outcome includes improved literacy skills in dyslexics by enhancing brain-speech tracking capabilities, particularly in noisy environments. The system features an intuitive interface that quantifies basic parameters of brain activity in real time via EEG, facilitating top-down control on specific activation patterns. Key monitoring parameters include phase coherence at the theta and delta bands. This project not only provides a diagnostic and therapeutic solution for language impairments but also offers a framework and technology for enhancing reading abilities, addressing critical needs in educational and clinical settings."
