        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development,\" aims to address the critical gaps in public service access that lead to an estimated 5.7 million annual deaths and 100 million annual cases of poverty, as reported by the Lancet Health Commission (2018). Drawing on the impressive strides seen in high-income countries and the significant challenges faced by low-income countries, particularly the one-third abandoned digitalization projects reported in the 2016 World Development Report, this project seeks to investigate the determinants of success and failure in digitalization efforts. Through four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, we will explore the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. Collaborating with local governments and NGOs, our research aims to inform public policy in low-income countries, ultimately ensuring broader access to more and higher quality public services."
