        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa) seeks to understand the complex processes underlying the evolution of human cultures through the transmission of written artefacts, focusing on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts. This project combines artificial intelligence with complexity science and philological expertise to analyze how texts were copied, transformed, or destroyed, and to investigate the role of human agency in shaping cultural canons. Using a stochastic birth-and-death process and computer multi-agent simulations, we will model the transmission of chivalric literature, a key European cultural tradition, across Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages. With a corpus of 4000 manuscripts, LostMa aims to determine the role of chance in the preservation or loss of texts and to elucidate how cultural canons are formed. By examining the transmission of texts as an evolutionary process, LostMa will provide novel insights into the dynamics of cultural transmission and the survival of texts over centuries. This interdisciplinary approach promises to revolutionize our understanding of medieval cultural evolution and the transmission of knowledge."
