        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a research project entitled \"Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-1945.\" The project aims to analyze the legal practices and outcomes of Japanese military courts during the Asia-Pacific War, focusing on East and Southeast Asian regions. The research will delve into how military justice was used to regulate violence for war objectives, deter and coerce civilian populations, and legitimize the war effort. By examining the harsh penalties, including execution and severe imprisonment, faced by both Japanese soldiers and civilians, as well as enemy soldiers, the study will explore the routinization and escalation of violence through the lens of military justice. Employing original archival work, the research will adopt an approach that combines the analysis of legal practice with an examination of the historical context. This project contributes to modern Japanese history and international law, offering valuable historical insights into contemporary humanitarian issues. The findings will enhance our understanding of the intersection between law and violence in wartime, with implications for the ethical considerations of military justice today."
