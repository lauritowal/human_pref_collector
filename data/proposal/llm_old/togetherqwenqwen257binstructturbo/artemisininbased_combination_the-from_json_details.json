    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the dynamics of the global pharmaceutical drug market through a detailed study of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) in Benin and Ghana, contrasting their pharmaceutical systems with Cambodia. The project aims to explore the complexities affecting the supply and demand of pharmaceuticals, particularly ACTs, and to analyze the globalizing processes impacting drug markets in these regions. By studying public health consequences and comparing drug systems, the research aims to address the issue of ACT resistance spreading from Asia to Africa. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach encompassing anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, the project is structured into six work packages, including the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, analysis of drug use, and the scope of ACT consumption. Additionally, the project will examine local production and ACT regulations, and explore the linkages with Asia. Training components include mentoring of 8 master students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doctoral researcher, fostering critical information for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and preventing the spread of ACT resistance. Supported by the PI's expertise in methodology and theory, and solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, this project will disseminate results through two symposiums and contribute to institutional impacts."
