        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the project \"Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires\" (GoviB). The study aims to explore the complex dynamics of governance and the negotiation of imperial rule in ancient Babylon from the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC, under the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian empires. By focusing on local negotiation strategies employed by Babylonian rulers to maintain stability or foster change, the research addresses incomplete and often conflicting historical data through a governance studies conceptual framework.\n\nThe project will utilize a rich array of resources, including Neo-Babylonian archival texts, German excavations in Babylon, and the extensive collections of the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin. Our goal is to enhance understanding of the political and social structures of ancient Babylon, evaluate the transformations within these empires, and provide insights into modern perceptions of oriental governance and regime stability. This interdisciplinary approach promises to offer new perspectives on the resilience and adaptability of Babylonian society in the face of imperial pressures, contributing significantly to our knowledge of ancient governance and cultural transitions."
