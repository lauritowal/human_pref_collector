        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal aims to elucidate the impact of gut microbiota on brain function and behavior through the lens of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to bridge a critical knowledge gap regarding the effects of gut-produced neurotransmitters on the brain. The project will leverage the high genetic identicality (99%) and low genetic difference impact (1%) in our human population to explore individual variability in brain and behavioral responses. We will employ biochemically informed assay methods, including direct and proxy measures, to investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria. A key focus will be on the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria, with a four-week intervention study using a custom-made probiotic. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy will be used to measure brain GABA levels, providing a robust measure of brain function. By addressing the distinctness of gut bacteria (ranging from 40-90%) and their ratio to human cells and DNA (1:1 and 10:1 respectively), we aim to understand how these factors influence individual differences in human behavior and brain function. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis, with potential implications for personalized approaches to mental health and neurodevelopment."
