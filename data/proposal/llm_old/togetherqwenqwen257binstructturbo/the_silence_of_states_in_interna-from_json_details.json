        "The proposal aims to address a critical gap in international law by conducting the first comprehensive study of the \"silence of States\" in international relations. The project, titled \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" seeks to explore the legal implications of State silence and inaction, and their role in international dispute resolution. It will provide a detailed taxonomy of different types of State silences, analyze their legal effects, and evaluate whether current legal frameworks adequately address the issues arising from State inaction. The research will employ a multi-faceted approach, including the analysis of State practice in six official UN languages, examination of international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical studies of reasoning from government officials and international judges. The project will focus on understanding the binding nature of State silence, the implications of State inaction on their responsibilities, and the impact of inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings. This study will contribute to the legal discourse by potentially necessitating a reevaluation of existing doctrines and practices, thereby informing States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals on the legal dimensions of State silence and inaction in the international arena."
