        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the social and cultural dynamics of late Ottoman Palestinians (1880-1920) in the Eastern Mediterranean, focusing on their responses to challenges of imperialism, Ottoman state building, and globalisation. Building on a robust methodology that includes comprehensive census data, the project will compare social practices across the region and beyond to understand how individuals and communities coped with and transformed their social landscapes. The research questions revolve around the strategies employed by Palestinians across ethnic, religious, and class divides to address these challenges. The hypothesis posits that an accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations. This project aims to contribute to global social and cultural history, develop a theoretical framework, establish methodological standards, and develop a historical GIS for the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, it seeks to examine the impact of colonialism under the British Mandate. The study will shed light on the resilience and adaptability of Palestinian society during a period of significant transformation."
