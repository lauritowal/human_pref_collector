        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to explore the functional cerebral asymmetry associated with impaired language development through a multidisciplinary approach. Building upon 150 years of research since Broca's discovery, our key hypothesis is the network efficiency hypothesis, which posits that individual differences in language function lateralization are critical to understanding language impairment.\n\nThe project is structured into five interconnected components. Component A employs a combination of behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions. Component B hypothesizes that individuals with language and literacy impairments are more likely to have different language functions represented in opposite hemispheres. Component C utilizes simulations from genetic models and twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization to identify genetic correlates. Component D adopts a double hit genetic model, focusing on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome, to investigate neurodevelopmental abnormalities arising from multiple hits on functional brain circuits. Finally, Component E focuses on individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality, aiming to uncover rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with these inconsistencies. Together, these components offer a comprehensive framework to advance our understanding of cerebral asymmetry and its role in language impairment."
