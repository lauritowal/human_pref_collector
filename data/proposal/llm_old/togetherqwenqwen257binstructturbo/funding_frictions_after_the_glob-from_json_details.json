        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for a critical investigation of \"Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis.\" The project aims to explore how funding frictions impact the financing conditions of countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 market turmoil. Key focus areas include understanding the effects of funding frictions on default risk, informing policy maker guidance, and developing strategies to reduce funding risk for institutions. The research will delve into elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and limited credit market access, among other manifestations of funding frictions. By examining market changes such as ballooning deficits, tighter regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, and the shift of pension risk to life insurance companies, the project will provide insights into funding costs and credit market access, propose effective debt management strategies for sovereigns, and enhance policy maker awareness of the regulatory consequences. This study is essential for optimizing policy responses and ensuring financial stability in the face of future economic challenges."
