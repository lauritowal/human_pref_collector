        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the research project titled \"The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800.\" Spanning from 1500 to 1800, this project aims to investigate the origins of modern industrial capitalism through the lens of Asian ports and the activities of European East India companies. Central to the project are the roles of factories, factors, and intercontinental trade in this period. The research will explore economic activities in imperial trading centers, focusing on the interactive roles of European and local merchants. The primary aim is to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, thereby recasting the narrative of global economic change and capitalism. Grounded in the \"New History of Capitalism,\" the project will develop a spatial theory of capitalist development by integrating large archival repositories and fostering global collaborations. This five-year project seeks to contribute significantly to the deconstruction of Eurocentric views on the history of capitalism and to offer a more comprehensive understanding of global economic dynamics."
