        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to address critical questions regarding the peopling of Australasia, specifically the timing, route, and method of the earliest human colonization by c.50,000 years ago. The project, titled \"Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul,\" integrates archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics to explore the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the earliest \"open water\" crossing. The research will focus on the Sunda (South East Asia) and Sahul (Australasia) regions, employing a multidisciplinary approach to examine submerged palaeolandscape, identify potential prehistoric sites, and enhance understanding of palaeoshorelines and tidal regimes. Archaeogenetic research will target mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to refine knowledge of demographic patterns and dating. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of environmental conditions, human origins, migration patterns, seafaring technology, and social organization and cognition. This project will significantly contribute to our understanding of human prehistory and the technological and cognitive aspects of early seafaring."
