        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal, titled \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\" (CCLAD), seeks funding to explore the emergence and contestation of justice norms within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This interdisciplinary project focuses on understanding the conditions under which norms for addressing loss and damage due to climate change achieve hegemony, and how they are influenced, contested, or reversed at both international and national scales. The research addresses the urgent need to address non-economic losses, disaster risk reduction, climate-related migration, and finance mechanisms, where consensus remains elusive.\n\nUtilizing a unique combination of micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative domestic policy practices, our approach draws on both ethnographic and theoretical methodologies to trace the fluidity of norm content through policy-making and implementation processes. By analyzing the interplay between international and national governance, CCLAD aims to contribute methodologically to political ethnography and the development of practice-tracing methods. The project's objectives include gaining new insights into the complex dynamics of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change, providing valuable knowledge for policymakers and scholars."
