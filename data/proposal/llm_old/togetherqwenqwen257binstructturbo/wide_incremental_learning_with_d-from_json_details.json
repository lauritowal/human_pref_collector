        "The proposal titled \"Wide Incremental Learning with Discrimination Networks\" aims to redefine our understanding of language processing beyond the conventional phone and word-based approach, focusing on Western linguistic thinking and the Chinese writing system's unique features. Drawing on the evolutionary timeline of language and literacy, this research seeks to model auditory comprehension and speech production across diverse languages, leveraging wide learning networks with tens of thousands of units and a simple error-driven learning rule. The project's goal is to develop a model that mimics human language processing strengths and weaknesses, aligning with current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. By exploring low-level acoustic properties, this research will contribute to the advancement of auditory comprehension development, modeling of diverse languages, and speech production extension, fundamentally altering our approach to language understanding. This project requires funding to support its ambitious research program and achieve its objectives."
