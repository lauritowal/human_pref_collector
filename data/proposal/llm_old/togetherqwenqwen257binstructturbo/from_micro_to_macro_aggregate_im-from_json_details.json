        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposal, titled \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade,\" explores the dynamics of international trade under firm heterogeneity, a critical yet underexplored dimension in contemporary trade economics. This project addresses three key research questions: the determinants of trade patterns and their welfare effects, the divergence between individual incentives and societal objectives, and the necessity of government intervention. Set in the context of Europe, it examines the broader implications of protectionist pressures and nationalistic tendencies. The project aims to revisit conventional trade models that assume homogenous firms, emphasizing the role of firm heterogeneity in allocative efficiency, optimal trade policies, comparative advantages, and exporter capabilities. Through four interconnected work packages, the project will investigate market allocative efficiency, the design of multilateral trade policies, the impact of trade liberalization on comparative advantages, and how firm heterogeneity shapes export ability. By doing so, this research seeks to enhance our understanding of international trade and inform more effective policy design."
