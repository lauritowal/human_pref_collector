        "This grant proposal seeks to revolutionize city logistics through the development of a comprehensive measurement system for public value, incorporating multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization techniques. The primary objective is to enhance the planning and management of city logistics by establishing a robust framework for evaluating and optimizing logistics services to maximize public value. Additionally, this project aims to develop principles, models, and tools for the design of Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure using network optimization methods. Furthermore, it will introduce a theoretical framework and models for the operational procedures of LaaS, leveraging learning-based optimization techniques to enhance logistics market efficiency. Expected outcomes include a new theory of city logistics, significant efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and maximization of public value. These advancements will have both scientific and practical implications for transport and logistics, with potential social, economic, and environmental benefits."
