        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance sustainable architecture through the development of an eco-metabolistic framework aimed at transforming traditional building practices. Titled \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture,\" this interdisciplinary project addresses the global crisis of material depletion by focusing on sustainable building practices, particularly the transition to bio-based materials. The project investigates the use of glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria, employing methods such as research-by-design and computational modeling networks for predictive, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. The eco-metabolistic framework challenges conventional design agency, promoting continual construction beyond building completion and fostering participatory, sustainable, and socially conscious models of production. Objectives include carbon-neutral and renewable design solutions, as well as materially optimized designs. This project aims to operationalize bio-based materials conceptually and operationally, offering fundamental value propositions for sustainable architecture."
