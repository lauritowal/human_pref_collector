        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the period of 1855 to 1959, a time marked by one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in approximately 12 million deaths across China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America. By leveraging the technological advancements of the era, particularly photography, this study will explore how visual records were employed to document and disseminate information about the plague's impact on societies. The research will focus on four key aspects: the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, the handling of death, corpses, and burial, and the race, class, and discrimination dynamics that emerged or were exacerbated during the plague. The project is led by a principal investigator with a team of three full-time, dedicated postdoctoral researchers. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a nuanced understanding of how visual representations shaped perceptions and responses to the pandemic, offering valuable insights into historical visual communication and its broader implications for public health and social order."
