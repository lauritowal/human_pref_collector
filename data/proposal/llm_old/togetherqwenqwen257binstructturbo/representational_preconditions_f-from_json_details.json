        "The proposed research, titled \"Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning,\" aims to explore the empirical implications of a novel theoretical approach to the early representational preconditions and functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. Building on recent evidence indicating that infants understand mental states by the second year, this project investigates cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, focusing on automatic processes involved in social interactions. We critique the standard view that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late developing, instead proposing that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions.\n\nOur research will explore the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, chart their developmental unfolding, and investigate the implications of our proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. We aim to demonstrate that mechanisms for understanding others' beliefs are present from as early as 7 months of age and that infants and adults automatically compute others' beliefs even when not required. This project will employ a novel theoretical perspective and a range of empirical methods to address these questions, contributing significantly to our understanding of social cognition and its developmental trajectory.\n\nThis research is informed by key references in the field, including works by Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and Kovacs et al. (in press Science), which have provided critical insights into the early development of social cognition. By advancing our understanding of the representational preconditions for understanding other minds, this project has the potential to inform educational practices and interventions aimed at promoting social and cognitive development."
