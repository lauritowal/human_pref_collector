        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support a research project titled \"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought,\" focusing on the interdisciplinary and comparative study of early contributions to formalism in philosophy of science and logic during the first half of the twentieth century. The project aims to reconstruct the historical and intellectual contexts of the formal turn, emphasizing the interplay between nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology from 1860 to 1910, with key figures including Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. It further explores the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism between 1920 and 1940, highlighting the works of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The project will analyze the philosophical implications of these developments, focusing on topics such as semantics in logic and philosophy, the philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. This comprehensive approach will provide new insights into the foundational aspects of modern logic and its influence on contemporary philosophy and science."
