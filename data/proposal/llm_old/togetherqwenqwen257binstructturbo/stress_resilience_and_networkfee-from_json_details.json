        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the mechanisms of stress resilience and vulnerability through a novel framework focused on alterations in large-scale neural systems due to acute stress. The project seeks to gain insight into brain adaptation to acute stress, identify transdiagnostic biomarkers predicting stress resilience versus sensitivity, and develop a method for training stress resilience. Our hypotheses posit that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale networks, which can be characterized using network connectivity modeling and validated in high-stress sensitivity patient groups. Key objectives include characterizing spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during stress and recovery, identifying neural markers of resilience using biosensors and mobile applications, and examining the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts. The project will employ a multi-modal approach, incorporating network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback. These techniques aim to enhance our understanding of higher-order cognition and develop neurofeedback methods to train adaptive reallocation of neural resources, ultimately contributing to the development of targeted interventions for stress-related disorders."
