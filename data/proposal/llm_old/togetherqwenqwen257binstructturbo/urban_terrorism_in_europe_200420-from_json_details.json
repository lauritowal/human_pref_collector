        "The grant proposal, titled \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" aims to provide the first comprehensive comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to acts of urban terrorism in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany between 2004 and 2019. Over this period, more than ten terrorist attacks occurred, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. The project employs interdisciplinary approaches, including memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining in the aftermath of these violent events. A key objective is to develop a new materialist approach to understanding terrorism. Methodologically, this project will assess existing policies and security infrastructures and incorporate alternative forms of remembering through public performances by the 'Center for Political Beauty.' The outputs will include a website with interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, and two PhD theses. This research will contribute to the academic discourse on terrorism and provide valuable insights for policymakers and security experts."
