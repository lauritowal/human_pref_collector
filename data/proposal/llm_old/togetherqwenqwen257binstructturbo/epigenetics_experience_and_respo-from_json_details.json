        "This grant proposal, titled \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for Neurodevelopmental Disorders\" (NEUROEPIGENETHICS), seeks to explore the ethical and practical implications of epigenetics in understanding and managing neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project will investigate how the social and physical environments influence neurodevelopmental outcomes through epigenetic mechanisms, challenging traditional notions of innate versus acquired traits and genetic versus environmental factors. By employing both theoretical and empirical investigation methods, NEUROEPIGENETHICS aims to elucidate the capacity and normative responsibilities related to these conditions. This research will engage professional stakeholders, including individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families, to ensure that the findings are relevant and actionable. Through this interdisciplinary approach, NEUROEPIGENETHICS will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders and inform ethical practices in their diagnosis, treatment, and support."
