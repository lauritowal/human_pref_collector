        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of mental processes through the development and delivery of neurocomputational models, with a focus on bridging the gap between brain and mind. The project, titled \"Developing and Delivering Neurocomputational Models to Bridge Between Brain and Mind,\" falls within the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. Its primary aims are to understand the nature of mental processes, elucidate how these processes arise from neural machinery, establish the basis of neurological patients' impairments, and improve clinical management and treatment.\n\nThe project will involve investigating complex mental behaviors and their underlying cognitive processes, mapping neural systems and their functions, and developing methods and tools to bridge brain and mental behavior. Key activities include the convergence of experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies. The goal is to secure methods and tools for systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience, plan and execute neuroscience and cognitive methods simultaneously, and force a convergence of results.\n\nA novel aspect of this project is the development of neurocomputational models that can mimic normal and impaired behavior, connect neuroanatomy and cognition, and provide a formalism for bridging between brain and cognition. By achieving these objectives, the project aims to significantly enhance our understanding of the brain-mind relationship and improve clinical outcomes for neurological patients."
