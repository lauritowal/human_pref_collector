    "descriptions": [
        "The HOMEOSTASIS project proposes a novel theoretical framework to reframe our understanding of working memory as a dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling of the visual world. This project addresses the limitations of the dominant theory, which fails to account for the effort involved in internal storage. The primary goal is to maintain perceptual homeostasis by optimizing this trade-off. By developing an \"internal mental economy\" model, we aim to explore how observers minimize internal storage to reduce cognitive effort, using novel experimental paradigms that interact with the physically present environment. We will employ advanced techniques such as electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology to gather empirical data. The project also includes a patient study focusing on individuals with restricted deficits to specific components of the model and will apply machine learning to discover biometric signatures in eye movements. This research has significant implications for diagnosing working memory disorders and understanding interactions with computer-manipulated virtual environments. Through this innovative approach, HOMEOSTASIS seeks to advance our knowledge of how the brain processes and retains information in dynamic, real-world contexts."
