        "This grant seeks to support the research and publication of \"Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe,\" a project that explores the pivotal role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages during the early modern period. The study redefines modernization in Jewish culture not as a break with tradition, but as an active engagement with new ideas, facilitated through translation. By focusing on the work of Jewish translators who reinterpreted and integrated these texts, the project aims to provide the first comprehensive analysis of this corpus. This research will highlight the intercultural dialogues that characterized early modern Europe, particularly the interactions between Christians and Jews. The project proposes a new paradigm for understanding the early modern 'Jewish book' and the processes of Jewish modernization, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between Jewish communities and the broader cultural context of the period. This initiative will contribute significantly to our understanding of cultural transfer and the formation of modern Jewish identity."
