        "Title: INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: What Do We Learn from French Firm-Level Data?\n\nAbstract: This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of innovation-driven economic growth through a rigorous examination of French firm-level data. Leveraging Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, the project aims to explore key factors such as innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and the effects of economic policies and institutions. Specifically, the research will address productivity growth measurement, the relationship between innovation and trade, the impact of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, and the complex relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and social wellbeing. The project will investigate how these factors contribute to overcoming the middle income trap, addressing secular stagnation, and mitigating top income inequality. By integrating theory with empirical analysis, this research will inform the design of effective growth policies. Our approach will provide critical insights into the mechanisms driving innovation and growth, enhancing our capacity to design and implement policies that foster sustainable economic development and social mobility."
