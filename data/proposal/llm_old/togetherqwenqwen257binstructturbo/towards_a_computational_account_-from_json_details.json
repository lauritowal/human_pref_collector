        "This grant proposal, entitled \"Towards a Computational Account of Natural Sequential Behavior,\" aims to develop computational models for understanding and modeling perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks. The project seeks to characterize sequential actions under perceptual uncertainty and action variability, focusing on optimal decision-making processes. Through a combination of behavioral experiments and integration of psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning, the project will explore classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making. Key outcomes include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits, and action variability. Building on previous work in visuomotor behavior and individual, trial-by-trial modeling, this project promises to advance our understanding of how humans make decisions in complex, uncertain environments."
