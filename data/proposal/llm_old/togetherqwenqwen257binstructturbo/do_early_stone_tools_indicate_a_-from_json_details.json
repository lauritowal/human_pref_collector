        "Title: STONECULT: Testing the Latent Solutions Model for Early Stone Tools\n\nAbstract:\nThis grant proposal, titled STONECULT, aims to address a fundamental question in human evolutionary biology: when did cultural abilities first arise in our lineage? The project seeks to test the hypothesis that early hominin stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture, but rather the result of the latent solutions model. Cultural adaptations are critical for human colonization of the planet, and the origin of human culture remains a pressing scientific question. Early hominin technology may not have relied on the same social learning mechanisms as modern humans, suggesting that the latent solutions model may better explain the origins of early stone tools.\n\nSTONECULT will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing approaches to evaluate whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions. The project will compare early hominin stone tools with modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches to better understand the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying these tool-making behaviors. The null hypothesis is that early stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture, while the alternative hypothesis posits that they are best accounted for by the latent solutions model.\n\nThe outcomes of this study have the potential to significantly inform fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. If the latent solutions model is confirmed, it would suggest that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, transforming our understanding of human culture evolution. This project is the first to systematically test the new latent solutions account of early stone tools, making it a critical step in unraveling the origins of human cultural abilities."
