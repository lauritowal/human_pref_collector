        "Title: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the multifaceted drivers of populist and extremist political decisions through an empirical examination of personal experiences, information environment, and economic shocks. The research is structured into three parts. Part 1 investigates the impact of personal employment histories and information environment on the 2016 U.S. presidential election outcomes, utilizing a database of over 40 million resumes from 2010-2016 and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Part 2 delves into how negative social experiences, particularly corporal punishment in U.K. schools during the 1970s and 80s, influence contemporary labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas. Part 3 examines factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, using a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda during World War II Germany. The overarching goal is to understand the role of economic shocks in the rise of populism and the diversity of responses to such shocks, providing insights into potential mitigation strategies."
