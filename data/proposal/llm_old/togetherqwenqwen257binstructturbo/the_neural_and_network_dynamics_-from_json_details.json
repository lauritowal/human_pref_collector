        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance our understanding of neural and network dynamics underlying social influence during adolescence, a critical period for development of academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. The project, titled \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence,\" aims to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models to address key questions about when and from whom adolescents seek social information. By leveraging computational models with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and social network analyses, this research will explore how adolescents actively seek social information in the context of social media and viral risk-taking challenges. The study will involve the development of novel tasks to capture real peer social networks and examine neural responses to social influence. Expected outcomes include insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advances in understanding social learning mechanisms, and the potential to inform the development of targeted interventions for promoting positive behaviors and mitigating risks. This project represents a novel and innovative approach to understanding adolescent social dynamics and their neural underpinnings."
