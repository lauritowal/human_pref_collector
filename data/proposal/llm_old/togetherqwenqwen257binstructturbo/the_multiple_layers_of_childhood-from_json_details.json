        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, titled \"The Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Adversity,\" aims to develop a comprehensive, unified data infrastructure for life course analyses involving 2 million individuals across three generations, focusing on multiple layers of childhood adversity. Leveraging interdisciplinary methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework, our initiative seeks to understand the patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of change associated with social, biological, health, social, neighbourhood, and environmental adversities. Our approach acknowledges the established roots of health inequality in childhood and its transgenerational transmission, with long-lasting effects on individuals and society. By integrating real-world policy data and nationwide simulations, we aim to redirect the focus towards the multiple layers of adversity and identify critical targets for support, particularly for children and families. This project will contribute significantly to evidence-based policy-making and support interventions that address the complex interplay of adversities throughout the life course."
