        "This grant proposal, titled \"Long-Term Investment: Determinants and Consequences,\" aims to study the multifaceted nature of long-term investment through three interconnected components: Financial Markets, Incentives, and Effects of Investment. The proposal differentiates between the capital-intensive, cost-efficient focus of 20th-century firms and the product quality and intangible asset-driven strategies of 21st-century firms, emphasizing the critical role of brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. We will explore how traditional financial markets, often inclined to short-term shareholder focus, can incorporate information about future investment opportunities, thus enhancing information efficiency. Our research will also delve into the optimal horizon of managerial incentives, particularly in industries where intangible assets play a significant role, such as education, to ensure alignment with long-term strategic goals. Lastly, we will examine the challenges in demonstrating the benefits of long-term investment through corporate social responsibility, linking these efforts to tangible firm value. This comprehensive study seeks to address the complexities of long-term investment in contemporary business environments, providing actionable insights for stakeholders."
