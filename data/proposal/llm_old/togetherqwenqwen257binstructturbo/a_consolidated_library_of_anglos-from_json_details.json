        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry,\" an online, interactive database containing all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse marked up through TEI P5 XML. Spanning from c. 670 to 1100 CE, the corpus comprises approximately 60,000 lines in Old English and Anglo-Latin, with manuscript witnesses typically preserved in various manuscripts. The library will highlight 50 named poets, documenting their influence on Anglo-Saxon literature. It will also explore anonymous verse to trace potential influences. The project will include digital resources, such as sound and image files, and will host conferences and workshops to foster scholarly dialogue. The comprehensive multilingual corpus will be published in a series, contributing significantly to the understanding of Anglo-Saxon poetry in the context of Latin and the vernacular co-existing in a Christian European setting. This initiative aims to enhance research, education, and appreciation of Anglo-Saxon literature both nationally and internationally."
