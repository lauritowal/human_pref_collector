        "Abstract:\n\nThe FLORA project aims to contribute to a global transformation of agri-food production, trade, and consumption through a systemic, interdisciplinary approach. Focusing on sustainability, health, and environmental impacts, this project will diagnose the integrated outcomes of food systems globally, identify key threats and opportunities using system dynamics and complex network analyses, and evaluate tailored solutions. The project seeks to create essential evidence for identifying and implementing effective shifts in practices and behaviors. Leveraging an inter-disciplinary modeling framework, FLORA will target and evaluate solutions, considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics. Building on the PI's excellent track record in interdisciplinary research, this project addresses critical challenges in global food systems, aiming to enhance both environmental sustainability and health outcomes. The FLORA project spans globally and employs a systemic approach to ensure comprehensive and actionable insights."
