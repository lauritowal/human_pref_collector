        "The proposal, titled \"The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\" (RESCALE), aims to explore and articulate a fundamental epistemological transformation in modern physics through an integrated historical and philosophical study. This project seeks to understand how the ideal of a final theory has influenced contemporary physics, particularly the shift since the 1950s towards theories that are effective only at specific scales. By examining the evolution of scale-based theoretical practice in physics, RESCALE will reveal a complex hierarchical structure of overlapping layers across scales, challenging the traditional notion of reductionism and offering a new framework for understanding the world. The study will also investigate the implications of these scale-based theories for key philosophical concepts such as representation, realism, and metaphysics. Through a combination of historical and philosophical methodologies, RESCALE will provide new insights into the nature of scientific knowledge and its philosophical interpretations, addressing significant gaps in our understanding at the frontiers of science. This project promises to contribute to a deeper appreciation of the interconnectedness of historical and conceptual developments in physics, fostering a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the theoretical landscape."
