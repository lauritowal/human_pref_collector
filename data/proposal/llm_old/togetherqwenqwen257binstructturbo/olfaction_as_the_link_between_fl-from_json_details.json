        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"OLFLINK: Olfaction as the Link Between Flavor Preference Formation and Retrieval during Food Consumption,\" aims to address the global health and sustainability challenges by altering human diets. The project investigates the odor-taste associative learning process, focusing on the cortical mechanisms underlying the transfer of appetitive properties from olfactory to taste perception. OLFLINK will be conducted across three levels of investigation: the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations (Objective 1: CODE), the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations (Objective 2: CONTROL), and the interactions with digestive feedback that regulate these coding systems during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval (Objective 3: REGULATE). This unique approach will uncover the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns and provide insights into adjusting learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs. The findings will contribute to the development of novel interventions for dietary changes across the life course. By understanding the neural mechanisms of flavor preference formation and regulation, this project seeks to enhance global food sustainability and public health."
