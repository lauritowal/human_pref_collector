        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the complex evolution of linguistic diversity in the Upper Amazon region of western South America through a multi-disciplinary approach. Our project aims to reconstruct and compare geographical, socio-historical, and communicative layers of history to uncover significant past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade. This region, characterized by extremely diverse linguistic patterns with signs of local contact and dominated by three language families, offers a unique lens into the interaction between ecology, human behavior, and cognition. By integrating methods from linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, and historical geography, we aim to provide new insights into social dynamics that have shaped linguistic diversity. Our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of historical population movements and the interplay between human societies and their environments."
