        "Title: \"Colonization, Early Institutions, and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization\"\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the origins of state capacity and the eventual democratization process in Latin America through the lens of the Spanish conquest. The project will explore how initial years of colonization, characterized by the limited knowledge of the conquering Spanish authorities, influenced the formation and development of state institutions. By leveraging a combination of case studies, panel data, and country-fixed effects analysis, this research will provide a nuanced understanding of how early colonial institutions shaped future state capacity and political structures. The project's unique advantage lies in its exclusive focus on the earliest stages of colonization, utilizing primary documents such as the Capitulaciones and records from the Archivo de Indias to uncover rules governing early institutions and the strategic placement of initial settlements at the subnational level. This approach will employ instrumental variables to address potential endogeneity concerns, thereby enhancing the robustness of the findings. The study aims to offer valuable insights into the historical determinants of state capacity and democratization, contributing to our understanding of long-term political development in Latin American countries."
