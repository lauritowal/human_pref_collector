        " The proposed project, \"Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work\" (CRAFTWORK), is a multi-methodological, pan-European study examining the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors within the EU. This research aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the relationship between identity and work, focusing on subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media.\n\nInnovative aspects of the project include the first comprehensive inquiry on 'neo-craft' work in the EU, a unique combination of digital methods and qualitative research, and a rethinking of interpretative categories for identity and work study. The project addresses societal challenges of the future of work and aims to contribute to critical studies of new forms of work.\n\nBy exploring the complexities of neo-craft work, the project seeks to illuminate the diverse ways in which individuals construct their identities in relation to their work, and how these constructions intersect with broader cultural and societal factors. The findings of this research have the potential to inform policy, improve working conditions, and promote social justice in the context of the future of work."
