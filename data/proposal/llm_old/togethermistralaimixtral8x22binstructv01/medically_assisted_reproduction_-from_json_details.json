        " The proposed research project, titled \"Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults and Families,\" aims to investigate the implications of the increasing number of Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) treatments on family well-being over the past four decades. With more than five million MAR-conceived children born, this study seeks to address the mixed and limited findings of previous research by employing a comprehensive analysis and innovative research designs to establish causality. The proposed methodology will involve comparing MAR-conceived individuals with spontaneously conceived siblings and adults who have undergone successful versus unsuccessful MAR treatments across various life domains. These domains include physical health, mental health, education, and union stability. The data sources for this study will be population registers and surveys.\n\nThe outcomes of this research have the potential to yield ground-breaking results, inform future research, and provide important policy implications. The beneficiaries of this study include health professionals, public health authorities, and policy-makers. The potential impact of this research includes informing health advising practices, resource allocation, and MAR treatment subsidies. Overall, this project will significantly contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the effects of MAR on family well-being, providing much-needed evidence to support informed decision-making in the field of public health and policy-making."
