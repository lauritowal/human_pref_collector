        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence,\" aims to investigate the critical role of social information in shaping adolescent behavior. It seeks to explore the significance of social media and viral risk-taking challenges in amplifying adolescent development, academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking.\n\nThe project's primary goals are to develop a new theoretical framework and formalize novel computational models that can elucidate the intricate dynamics of social influence during adolescence. The proposed research introduces several novelties, including the conceptualization of adolescents as active information seekers, the development of novel tasks, the integration of computational models with functional magnetic imaging, and an experimental study within real peer social networks, complemented by social network analyses.\n\nThe research questions at the heart of this proposal are \"when to search for social information\" and \"who to learn from.\" To address these questions, the project will employ a combination of methodologies, including the development of novel tasks, computational modeling, functional magnetic imaging, and social network analyses.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are threefold: to provide insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, to advance our understanding of social learning mechanisms, and to inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting positive outcomes in adolescents. This research holds significant potential to contribute to the field of adolescent development and social learning, with implications for policy and practice in education and youth mental health."
