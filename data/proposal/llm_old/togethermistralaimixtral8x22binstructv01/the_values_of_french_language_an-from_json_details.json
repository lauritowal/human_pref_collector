        " In \"The values of French language and literature in the European Middle Ages,\" we propose a comprehensive reevaluation of the French language's supralocal, transnational role in Europe from 1100 to 1450. Our project aims to explore the intricate relationship between language and identity during this historically multilingual period, focusing on French as a non-local language alongside Latin. By employing a multi-disciplinary approach that includes codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, we seek to foster collaboration between European and North American scholars to uncover new insights into the textual tradition of \"L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César.\" Our research questions delve into the historical demarcation of cognate languages and the role of French in shaping European identity. Through empirical research and speculative reflection, we will interrogate the French language's role in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the broader discourse on linguistic identity and its historical significance, while promoting cross-cultural scholarly exchange and collaboration."
