        " Title: Control of Impulsive Action\n\nThis grant proposal aims to delve into the intricate mechanisms of impulse control and explore strategies for improvement, ultimately benefiting individuals and society. Our research questions encompass the emergence of novel impulsive actions during task-preparation, the role of negative emotions, the impact of learning on impulsive behavior, the functionality of impulsive actions, and the relationship between impulsivity variation and trait impulsivity.\n\nWe propose a multi-faceted approach, incorporating behavioral paradigms and cognitive neuroscience techniques such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroencephalography (EEG). Physiological measures, including facial Electromyography (EMG), will be employed to capture the bodily manifestations of impulsivity. Mathematical modeling of decision-making will further enrich our understanding of impulse control.\n\nOur objectives include specifying the origin and control of impulsive actions, replacing the currently dominant 'inhibitory control' models with more comprehensive models, explaining impulsivity and control over time and space, developing a new behavioral model of impulsive action, understanding the causes of individual differences in impulsivity, and elucidating disorders associated with impulse-control deficits.\n\nThis research has significant implications for improving mental health outcomes, enhancing decision-making processes, and promoting societal well-being by mitigating the negative impacts of impulsive behavior."
