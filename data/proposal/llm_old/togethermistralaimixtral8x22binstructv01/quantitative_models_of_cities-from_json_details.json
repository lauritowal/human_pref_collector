        " In the proposed research project, \"Quantitative Models of Cities,\" we aim to explore economic divergence across and within countries, as well as between urban and rural areas. Our historical niche interest lies in the 20th century, during which significant economic shifts occurred. Recent advancements in high-resolution data and theoretical breakthroughs have opened new avenues for understanding these phenomena.\n\nOur project innovations involve combining quantitative models with register data, developing a dynamic model, leveraging detailed Danish data, allowing for worker and firm heterogeneity, and addressing policy-relevant questions. These innovations will enable us to analyze urban transport infrastructure, the effect of height restrictions, and the impact of planning interventions on cities.\n\nThe proposed project builds upon the work of Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), who have made significant contributions to the understanding of urban economics. By integrating these insights with our proposed innovations, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the economic dynamics of cities.\n\nThe findings from this project could have significant implications for urban planning and policy. By understanding the factors that contribute to economic divergence, policymakers can make informed decisions about infrastructure investments, height restrictions, and planning interventions. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the development of more equitable and sustainable cities."
