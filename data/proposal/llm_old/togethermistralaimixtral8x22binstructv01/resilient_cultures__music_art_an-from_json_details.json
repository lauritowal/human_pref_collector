        " In this innovative research project, titled \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\", we delve into the vibrant and intricate world of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema across various localities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our research focuses on the expression of social and political discontent, resiliece, cultural critique, and authoritarianism within the context of platformization.\n\nWe employ a comparative analysis of cultural fields, including indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui. Our methodological toolkit comprises ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research to ensure a holistic and nuanced understanding of these cultural practices.\n\nThrough this project, we aim to foster a network of researchers and practitioners across mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, engaging in workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions. Our anticipated outcomes include the promotion of multivocality, diversity, and vitality of cultural production, serving as a beacon of inspiration for future research in comparative contexts such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey.\n\nThis project, in essence, is an exploration of how cultural practices develop resilient tactics to express their social and political discontent, as encapsulated in our tentative title, \"RESCUE\". By understanding these dynamics, we hope to contribute to the broader discourse on the role of culture in navigating and challenging authoritarian regimes."
