        " The proposed project, \"A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models,\" aims to address the proliferation of cognitive modeling ideas and techniques, idiosyncratic applications of cognitive models, and the unclear state-of-the-art in cognitive modeling. By developing a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models, this project seeks to set a new standard for cognitive modeling. The focus models for this project include drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models.\n\nThe methods used for this project will be based on Bayesian inference foundations and will include the assessment of absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, exploration of efficient algorithms for parameter estimation, and application to data from popular experimental designs. Enhancements to these methods will include the construction of plausible parameter priors, development of diagnostic experiments, assessment of Bayes factors for hierarchical designs, and model-averaged assessment of parameter changes.\n\nThe practical relevance of this project is significant, as the techniques developed will be incorporated into JASP, making new methodology available for students, researchers, and practitioners. The project's outcome will be a unified framework that sets a new standard for cognitive modeling, with the potential to significantly impact the field of cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology. The project will be supported by the software JASP and the website jasp-stats.org."
