        " The proposed project, \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health,\" aims to conduct a socio-historical study of the transition between two regimes of knowledge and action in post-World War II health governance. Spanning from the post-World War II era to the emergence of the current regime in the 1980s, this project will focus on tuberculosis, mental health, traditional medicine, and medical genetics. The investigation will utilize both historical and anthropological approaches to explore the changing roles of the WHO and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India.\n\nThe project's expected benefits include the inclusion of diverse social worlds such as laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. By approaching global health as translated in and emerging from local practices and knowledge, this study will explore different levels of circulation beyond North-South transfers. Moreover, it will provide valuable insights into the transition from the Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty.\n\nThe project will analyze the shift from international public health, which was focused on eradication and UN organizations, to global health, characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public alliances. This research will not only deepen our understanding of the evolution of global health governance but also provide critical insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead."
