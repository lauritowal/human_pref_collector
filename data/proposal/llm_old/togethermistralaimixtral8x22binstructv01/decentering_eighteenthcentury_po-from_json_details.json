        " This grant proposal, titled \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth, and Welfare in the Swedish Empire,\" aims to reassess the early history of European political economy by focusing on practical concerns and measures for betterment and improvement in the eighteenth century. The primary case study centers on the Swedish empire, with comparisons drawn to other cases for broad applicability. Key concepts explored include improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare.\n\nThe project hypothesizes that activities in various discursive production sites—including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals—were directed towards improving the organization of state and society and the living conditions of the people. By examining the Swedish empire's political economy, this research seeks to challenge current understandings of European political economy and provide a fresh perspective on historical debates surrounding wealth, growth, and welfare.\n\nThis study will contribute to the field by offering a more nuanced and contextually grounded interpretation of eighteenth-century political economy, emphasizing the practical concerns and policy implications of the time. The comparison with other cases will further enhance the project's relevance and applicability, ultimately enriching our understanding of the historical foundations of modern political economy and its implications for contemporary debates."
