        " Title: The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\n\nThis proposed project aims to explore the influence of the international right to housing on national legal discourse by employing data science techniques to analyze eviction litigation cases. The study focuses on Europe, where approximately 700,000 individuals were affected by evictions during the 2007-2011 period, primarily due to the financial crisis. The research will emphasize the interaction between national and international law, utilizing legal big data resulting from this period.\n\nThe project will employ a data-driven analysis, utilizing citation network analysis and machine learning techniques to scrutinize cases from national supreme courts and lower-level courts. The primary objectives include identifying predictors of court decisions and conducting empirical analysis to conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this project are significant. By identifying predictors of court decisions, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence judicial outcomes in eviction cases. Furthermore, the research application extends beyond this specific area of law, as the methodologies developed can be applied to future projects in other areas of the law.\n\nIn summary, this project will employ innovative data science techniques to analyze the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse through eviction litigation cases. The findings will not only contribute to the existing body of knowledge but also provide practical insights that can be applied to other areas of law."
