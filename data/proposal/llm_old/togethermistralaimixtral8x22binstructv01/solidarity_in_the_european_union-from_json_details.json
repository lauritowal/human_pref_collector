        " In our grant proposal, \"Solidarity in the European Union,\" we aim to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1) and apply this model to address central issues in the EU (EUSOL2). Our project seeks to provide a comprehensive normative account of solidarity within the European Union, tackling key concerns such as the free movement of persons, burden-sharing in EU refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession. The proposed research will contribute significant theoretical and practical insights into the nature of solidarity in the EU, offering policy recommendations to foster greater unity and cooperation among member states.\n\n**Word Count:** 111"
