        " The Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively (POLEMIC) project seeks to examine the role of emotional appeals in shaping citizens' political choices and the strategic use of such appeals by politicians. Spanning from 1945 to the present and covering nine countries, POLEMIC aims to address three primary research questions: (1) Do emotional appeals affect citizens' political choices? (2) Do politicians make more emotional appeals than in the past? (3) Why are politicians increasingly employing emotional appeals?\n\nBy bridging the fields of party politics and political psychology, POLEMIC will test three key theories – vote-maximizing strategy, product of politician's personality, and fashionable trend – to better understand the motivations behind emotional appeals. Utilizing innovative methods such as automated text analysis and physiological measurement, this project will adopt both macro (what politicians say) and micro (how citizens respond) perspectives to comprehensively analyze the phenomenon.\n\nThe expected outcomes of POLEMIC will shed light on the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making processes and uncover the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals. Ultimately, this research endeavors to extend existing theory and employ novel methods to elucidate when emotional appeals are persuasive and when emotional attachments prevent persuasion. By exploring these questions, POLEMIC will contribute valuable insights to the broader understanding of political behavior and the strategic use of emotion in contemporary politics."
