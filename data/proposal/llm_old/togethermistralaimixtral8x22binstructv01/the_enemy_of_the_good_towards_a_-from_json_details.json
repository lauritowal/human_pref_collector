        " This proposal, titled \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" aims to develop an alternative theory of moral progress that transcends current limitations and expands the circle of moral concern. The project will focus on different forms of moral progress, exploring moral attitudes that are not subject to evolutionary constraints, and proposing smart institutions to overcome our inherited psychological limitations. The current model of moral progress, while valuable, is constrained by parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin. This proposal seeks to extend moral concern beyond these constraints, addressing ethically arbitrary features such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. The ultimate goal is to create a more inclusive and equitable moral framework that can guide our actions and institutions towards true moral progress."
