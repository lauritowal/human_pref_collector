        " This grant proposal, titled \"Understanding Trajectories of Wealth Accumulation and Their Variability\" (project code: WEALTHTRAJECT), aims to comprehensively document and analyze the variability in wealth trajectories over people's lives, focusing on both intragenerational and intergenerational drivers. Our primary objectives include identifying the diverse patterns of wealth gains and losses, understanding the factors contributing to this variability within a generation, and establishing the link between family background and wealth trajectories across generations. To achieve these objectives, we propose a novel approach that combines longitudinal data from surveys and registers with original life history data on wealth accumulation trajectories. This innovative methodology, coupled with advanced quantitative analysis, will allow us to explore long-term wealth accumulation trajectories and the resulting wealth inequality with unprecedented depth and precision. Our project is the first of its kind to systematically examine the diversity in long-term wealth accumulation trajectories within and between social groups. By shedding light on these complex dynamics, we hope to contribute significantly to the broader discourse on wealth inequality and inform policy-making for more equitable wealth distribution."
