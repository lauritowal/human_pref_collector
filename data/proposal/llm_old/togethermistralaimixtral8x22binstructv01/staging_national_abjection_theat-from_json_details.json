        " This grant proposal, titled \"Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas,\" aims to examine the role of theatre in the constitution of \"the Turkish nation\" and its Others, from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. The research will employ transdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic research methods to provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government and ask critical questions about the role of theatre in the politics of belonging in the nation-state. The case studies include theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide, negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas, Islamic theatre in Turkey and European diasporas, Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe, and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. The research objectives are to explore the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship, advance understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and offer insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies. This research will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the role of theatre in the negotiation of identity, belonging, and citizenship."
