        " This grant proposal, titled \"Between Canon and Coincidence: using data-driven approaches to understand Art Worlds\" (BECACO), aims to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections as a large-scale study of socio-politico-historical conjunctures that led to the translocation of cultural material. Introducing the concept of \"Art World Patterns\" by Becker (2008[1982]), this project focuses on the provenance of Indigenous Latin American material held in 12 museums across 9 countries between 1850 and 2000, with a geographical focus on Europe. The primary objectives of this research include developing new models for provenance research and achieving conceptual and methodological advances. To achieve these outcomes, the project will employ quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining methodologies on a large corpus of provenance data. The successful completion of this project will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe."
