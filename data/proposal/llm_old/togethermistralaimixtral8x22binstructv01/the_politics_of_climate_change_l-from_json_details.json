        " The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage, or CCLAD, is a proposed interdisciplinary research project under the umbrella of International Relations, focusing on the emergence and contestation of justice norms within the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Recognizing the urgent need to address the consequences of climate change, this project will delve into policy areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration, where a lack of consensus on loss and damage policy is evident.\n\nThe CCLAD project will employ an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic methodology, examining the micro-politics of international negotiations and conducting comparative research on domestic policy practices at both international and national levels. The primary objectives include understanding the conditions for norm hegemony, exploring instances of norm influence, contestation, or reversal, and developing a new understanding of norm-content fluidity.\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of this project posits that norms are partly constituted through policy-making and implementation. By studying the norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage, the CCLAD project aims to make significant contributions to the field of political ethnography, particularly in the development of practice-tracing methods. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding the politics of climate change loss and damage, potentially influencing policy development and implementation in this critical area."
