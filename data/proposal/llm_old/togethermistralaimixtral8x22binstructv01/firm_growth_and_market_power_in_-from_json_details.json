        " The proposed research project, Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy, aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power, providing valuable insights into welfare and policy implications in a globalized world. Motivated by EC 2007, the project will incorporate richer firm behaviors into models of international trade, focusing on the impact of trade and industrial policies on growth, particularly in less developed markets.\n\nOver a period of five years, the research will center around developing economies, integrating theoretical work with rich data. The project will address key research questions, such as: how can trade and competition policy ensure consumers benefit from globalization when firms engaged in international trade have market power? How do domestic policies to encourage agribusiness firms affect the extent to which small farmers gain from trade? How do industrial policies affect firm growth through input linkages? What is the impact of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector?\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research project will not only expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy but also provide a basis for informed policymaking. By examining the sources of firm growth and market power, BIGlobal will offer new insights into welfare and policy, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the global economy."
