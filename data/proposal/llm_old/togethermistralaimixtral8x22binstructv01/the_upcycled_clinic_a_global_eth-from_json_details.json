        " The Upcycled Clinic: A Global Ethnography of Material Creativity in Contemporary Medicine is a pioneering research project aimed at addressing wastefulness in medicine through an ethnographic lens. This ambitious endeavor, comprising five sub-projects spanning Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S, and the U.K, seeks to understand the conditions that foster creative material engagement in clinical settings.\n\nInvolving ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff, the project employs a blend of fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets to explore the practice of repurposing in the clinic. The proposed research aims to shift the focus of hospital ethnographies beyond patient encounters and present the first globally oriented study of improvisation in the clinic. Furthermore, it endeavors to advance theories of materiality and address questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace.\n\nThe Upcycled Clinic also aims to develop new methods for reusing and sharing research material, contributing to the field's methodological advancement. The practical outcomes of this project include articulating the conditions for healthcare creativity and local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.\n\nBy shedding light on the innovative ways in which clinics across the globe repurpose materials, this research holds significant implications for improving resource management and sustainability in healthcare settings. Ultimately, The Upcycled Clinic aims to inspire a more mindful and resourceful approach to healthcare, paving the way for a greener and more efficient global healthcare system."
