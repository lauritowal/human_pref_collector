        " This grant proposal, titled \"An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative,\" presents the SynSig project, an innovative exploration into the intricate relationship between interpersonal synchrony and mental health at the individual level. Challenging the conventional wisdom that more synchrony always equals better, SynSig aims to delve into the unique synchrony signatures of individuals and examine how these can be tailored to improve mental health outcomes.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures, explore the potential for individual-tailored correction of these signatures, and analyze the transformation of relationships into therapeutic ones through synchrony adjustments. To achieve these objectives, SynSig will employ a multimodal approach, utilizing motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression markers to study individuals in dyadic interactions with both humans and virtual humans.\n\nThe project's anticipated outcomes include evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the multifaceted and individual-specific nature of synchrony, and a deeper understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. Moreover, SynSig will develop the first multimodal feedback system for momentary deviations from synchrony signatures, facilitating individual-tailored changes in synchrony and drawing causal inferences between these changes and mental health outcomes."
