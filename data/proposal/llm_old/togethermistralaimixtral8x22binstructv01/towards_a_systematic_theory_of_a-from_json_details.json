        " Our project, titled \"Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry\" (STARTDIALOG), aims to develop a unified theory for Aristotelian diagrams, addressing the current lack of understanding surrounding their logical properties and underappreciated heuristic potential. By employing a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and creating a comprehensive diagram database, we intend to clarify and solve existing issues, fostering an accurate understanding of their methodological importance.\n\nThis research will contribute to a breakthrough in logical geometry and have significant relevance for philosophical logicians. The proposed project will impact various disciplines, including philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. Our interdisciplinary approach will not only study diagrams as objects of independent interest but also explore their applications in these fields.\n\nThe expected outcomes include clarifying and solving current issues surrounding Aristotelian diagrams, facilitating an accurate understanding of their methodological importance, and promoting their study as independent objects of interest. Ultimately, our research aims to create a comprehensive theoretical foundation for Aristotelian diagrams, paving the way for their broader application and appreciation across multiple disciplines."
