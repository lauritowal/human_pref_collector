        " This grant proposal, titled \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication,\" aims to investigate the systematic, meaningful communication in great ape gestures and its significance for understanding the evolution of human language. The research objectives include: 1) examining cultural variation in ape gesture across species, physical environments, and social interactions; 2) determining if combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and analyzing the construction of meaning; and 3) studying human-ape gesture comparison in both use and comprehension among adults and children.\n\nThe proposed methods for this study involve pan-African data collection across 17 ape and 9 human groups. The research will explore species-specific, environmental, and social factors in gesture acquisition and use, and analyze signal combination and the construction of meaning in ape communication. Additionally, the project will compare gesture use and comprehension between humans and apes.\n\nThis project addresses the fundamental question of human language evolution and explores core language features such as social learning and syntactic structure in the context of ape communication. The findings from this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins and development of human language, as well as the complexities of ape communication systems. By examining the similarities and differences between human and ape gesture use and comprehension, this project will also shed light on the potential for interspecies communication and the implications for human-ape interaction."
