        " The proposed project, \"Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics\" (BACKWARD), aims to revolutionize our understanding of human evolution by extending molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA (aDNA) limits. Our objectives include developing a new generation of palaeoproteomic workflows and deploying advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions. By employing palaeoproteomics and MS-based ancient protein sequencing, we will address the extinct hominid phylogeny in Africa and Asia, reconstructing evolutionary history for species extinct millions of years ago. Our primary targets encompass phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe applications of this research are vast, including identifying and correlating processes of human brain expansion and reorganization, as well as species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Additionally, the methodologies developed in this project have potential for commercial repurposing in diagnostics in forensic medicine, the food industry, and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort among participating institutions, with a legacy comparison to the transformative impact of aDNA over the past two decades. By pushing the boundaries of biomolecular studies, we hope to gain unprecedented insights into human history and adaptation, providing a robust foundation for future research in this field."
