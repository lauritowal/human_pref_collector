        " This grant proposal, titled \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to address the complex issue of banking crises and their relationship with strong credit growth. The current consensus suggests tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension to mitigate the negative externalities from the financial to the macro real sector. However, empirical evidence on the decisive impact of individual factors contributing to this phenomenon is lacking.\n\nThe proposed project seeks to fill this gap by empirically identifying and estimating the impact of each component on loan growth. These components include financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios. The challenge lies in the complexity of the global banking system and the lack of micro-level data, which this project aims to overcome by utilizing exceptional micro-level datasets.\n\nThe project will employ an appropriate methodology to analyze the impact of each factor on credit growth. When theoretical frameworks are missing, they will be provided to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena. Additionally, the project will assess the potential combinations of these ingredients to understand their interaction better. The external validity of the findings will be ensured by the individual dataset settings and methodologies.\n\nIn conclusion, this project aims to provide a comprehensive, empirically grounded understanding of the drivers of growth in bank lending and their role in financial crises. This knowledge can inform more effective financial regulation and crisis mitigation strategies."
