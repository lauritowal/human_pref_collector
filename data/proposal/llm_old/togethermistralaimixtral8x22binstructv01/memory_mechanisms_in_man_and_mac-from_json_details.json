        " The proposed project, \"Memory Mechanisms in Man and Machine,\" aims to validate a set of ten provocative claims regarding the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories in humans and artificial systems. The claims encompass the recognition of visual and auditory stimuli not experienced for decades, the role of oscillatory brain activity in memory storage, and the potential for \"Grandmother Cells\" and \"Neocortical Dark Matter\" in long-term memory. The project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach, drawing from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and hardware development.\n\nThe experimental paradigm will involve studying the formation and maintenance of very long-term sensory memories using a combination of fMRI imaging, EEG recording, and intracerebral recording from epileptic patients. Computer simulations of networks of spiking neurons with Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity will be used to test the claims regarding the production of \"Grandmother Cells\" and the requirement of binary synaptic weights for memory selectivity. The project also includes the development of bio-inspired hardware mimicking brain memory systems, utilizing memristor-like devices to mimic brain memory systems in artificial systems.\n\nThis project aims to explore the parallels between human neural processes and potential artificial computing architectures, contributing to a deeper understanding of long-term memory formation and maintenance. The findings from this project could have significant implications for the development of more efficient and effective memory systems in artificial intelligence and computing."
