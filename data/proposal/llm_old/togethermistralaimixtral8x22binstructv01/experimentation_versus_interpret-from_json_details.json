        " The proposed project, \"Experimentation versus Interpretation: exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century,\" aims to challenge traditional conceptions of music performance by shifting from text-based to performative-based works, exploring experimental performance practices, and assessing the transferability of the scientific experimentation model to music performance. Hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, this project aligns with the discourse of Artistic Experimentation and falls within the context of Artistic Research.\n\nThe project's objectives include investigating traditional conceptions bound to history, creating new paths through experimental practices, and assessing the feasibility of applying a scientific experimentation model to music performance. Material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs will serve as key methodologies.\n\nExpected contributions from this project include innovations in theory and practice, opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, and concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. The project outputs will challenge the status quo in the field of musical performance, offering an alternative to traditional 'interpretation.'\n\nBy combining theoretical investigation with practical music practice, the project aims to foster a more dynamic and exploratory approach to music performance, ultimately contributing to the broader discourse of Artistic Experimentation. This project seeks to push the boundaries of conventional music performance, opening up new avenues for creativity and expression in the twenty-first century."
