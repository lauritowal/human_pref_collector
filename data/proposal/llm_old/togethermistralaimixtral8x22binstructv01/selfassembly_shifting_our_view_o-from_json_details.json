        " Title: Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life\n\nThe AssemblingLife project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by integrating self-assembly processes into the philosophy of science. By examining life through the lens of nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science, we aim to construct a novel theoretical framework that redefines genetic causation and scientific explanation.\n\nOur primary objectives include:\n1. Developing a new understanding of genetic causation with genes as 'nudgers', rather than deterministic agents.\n2. Formulating a new theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes, which challenges traditional views of life as systems requiring constant input of energy and detailed regulation by genetic material.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are far-reaching and transformative. Our work promises to shift the view of life in both ways, science and philosophy, by offering conceptual tools to the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences. This new perspective may foster interdisciplinary collaborations and inspire innovative research methodologies, ultimately reshaping our understanding of life and its underlying mechanisms."
