        " Title: Truth and Semantics\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a project that aims to provide a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceptualized as truth-conditional semantics, and explore the research surrounding semantic paradoxes and self-applicable truth theories. The overarching objective is to develop a systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, which has not been done before.\n\nTwo primary challenges are addressed in this project: \"Truth in Semantics\" and \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics.\" To tackle these challenges, the project is divided into two parts:\n\n1. Truth in Semantics: This part aims to develop semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language. Key elements of this part include the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive understanding of truth in the context of semantics, thereby addressing the first challenge.\n\n2. Truth and the Foundations of Semantics: This part adopts a metasemantic perspective, focusing on the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics. By examining this relationship, the project will not only address the second challenge but also contribute to the broader understanding of semantics and its foundations.\n\nThe successful completion of this project will result in the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective. This will provide valuable insights for linguists, philosophers, and researchers in related fields, and contribute to the ongoing discourse on semantics and truth."
