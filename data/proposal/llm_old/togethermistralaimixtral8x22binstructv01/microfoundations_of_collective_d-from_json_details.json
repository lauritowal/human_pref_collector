        " The proposed project, \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence,\" aims to inaugurate a novel research agenda on the microfoundations of collective defence. The project will employ an extensive, cross-national investigation in key NATO member states, utilizing experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology as its primary approaches. The unit of analysis will be the views of individuals, focusing on the formation of attitudes towards allied assistance in different collective defence scenarios, the aggregation of individual attitudes to form public opinion, and the influence of public opinion on decision-makers in allied states.\n\nThe project hypothesizes that the strategic context impacts the formation of public opinion, conventional scenarios of direct armed aggression limit the role of public opinion, and ambiguous 'grey zone' conflicts increase public opinion polarization and relevance for policy-making. The methodological innovation lies in the use of novel immersive mixed-media experiments, designed to be interactive, engaging, and realistic for participants. The findings from this research could potentially redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances, offering significant policy implications for NATO member states and beyond. This project promises to contribute to a deeper understanding of collective defence, a topic of increasing relevance in the current geopolitical climate."
