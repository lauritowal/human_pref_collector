        " This grant proposal, titled \"ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME,\" aims to develop and assess a multicomponent intervention to promote active ageing among older adults. Our project is guided by the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing and seeks to create a novel scale for assessing active ageing across the dimensions of ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy.\n\nOur primary objectives include examining the determinants and modifiers of active ageing, developing a sustainable intervention, testing its feasibility and effectiveness through a randomized controlled trial, and investigating cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. The proposed intervention will incorporate counseling, information technology, and volunteer support as key components.\n\nData collection will involve a cross-sectional sample of 1,000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85, with current data compared against pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago. State-of-the-art statistical methods will be employed for data analysis.\n\nThe overarching aims of this project are to generate novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and to produce evidence for promoting active ageing. The anticipated benefits of this project include the development of a novel scale for active ageing, training opportunities for young scientists, and the advancement of new concepts and theories in the field of gerontology.\n\nBy addressing the critical gap in understanding and promoting active ageing, this project has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for older adults and contribute to the broader discourse on healthy and productive ageing."
