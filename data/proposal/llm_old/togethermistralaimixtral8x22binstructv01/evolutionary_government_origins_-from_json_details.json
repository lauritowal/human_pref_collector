        " The proposed project, \"Evolutionary Government: Origins and Consequences of Structural Change in Government,\" aims to investigate the underlying reasons for government structural changes and their subsequent impact on policy-making. The study, named STATE-DNA, posits that structural changes within government units result from the interplay between their inherent features and the broader organizational and environmental context. This research hypothesizes that these structural shifts consequently influence policy as an evolutionary process managed by distinct units.\n\nUtilizing a dataset spanning from 1815 to 2025 and encompassing six countries with 150,000 units, the study will employ genetic measures to assess structural change and data assimilation techniques borrowed from biology. Key concepts explored include structural change, units inside ministries and agencies, and the decline of party government.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are threefold: first, the creation of a comprehensive data set documenting government structures since the early 19th century; second, a systematic analysis of the effects of structural change on government policy; and third, the development of predictive forecasting models for future structural changes within governments.\n\nIn essence, this project seeks to provide a thorough understanding of how and why government structures evolve, thereby enhancing our ability to predict and manage such changes in the future."
