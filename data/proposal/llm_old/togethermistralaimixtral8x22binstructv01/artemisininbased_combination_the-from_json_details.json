        " The proposed research project, \"Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa,\" aims to investigate the realities affecting the global drug market using ACTs as a case study in two African countries, Benin and Ghana, and a comparison study in Cambodia. The project seeks to study the formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, analyze drug use, and examine the scope of ACT consumption. It will also analyze local production and ACT regulations and open into Asia to address the issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nThe project's objectives include studying the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana, analyzing public health consequences, and comparing drug systems. The project will be interdisciplinary, involving anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, and will be divided into six work packages. The project's goals are to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nThe project will train eight Master students, two PhD students, and one post-doctoral researcher. The project will be supported by the PI's skills in methodology and theory and solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana. The project's findings will be disseminated through two symposiums, and it will have institutional impacts. Overall, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the global pharmaceutical drug market and its impact on public health in Africa and Asia."
