        " The proposed project, \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES), aims to address the issue of responsibility dilution among actors in international cooperation, ensuring the protection of the international rule of law, and providing remedies for injured parties within shared responsibilities. The project seeks to rethink the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions and overcome the challenges posed by complications in determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility.\n\nSHARES will adopt a multi-faceted approach to uncover the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and develop new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility. The focus areas will include principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, as well as processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies. The project will employ a combination of conceptual and theoretical foundations and an empirical approach through case-studies.\n\nThe primary objective of SHARES is to explore the problem of scattering of responsibilities and provide solutions for better matching international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility. This project will contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge in international law and offer practical solutions for addressing the complexities of shared responsibility in international cooperation."
