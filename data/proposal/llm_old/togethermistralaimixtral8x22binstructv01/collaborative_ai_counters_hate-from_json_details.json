        " The \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate\" project aims to develop an innovative solution for addressing AI-assisted extreme speech moderation challenges, employing a collaborative bottom-up coding approach. Our primary focus is to improve the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets and establish procedural guidelines with cultural contextualization.\n\nTo achieve this, we propose the implementation of a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions and a community-based classification approach. This includes fostering collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries, following the AI4Dignity project model.\n\nOur goals are multifaceted: improving AI-assisted speech moderation, developing an open-access toolkit, setting procedural benchmarks, operationalizing the \"human in the loop\" principle, and creating inclusive training datasets. These objectives aim to tackle online hate speech and disinformation, two of the most pressing issues in digital communication today.\n\nBy integrating diverse perspectives and expertise, we strive to ensure that our solution is not only effective but also equitable and culturally sensitive. This collaborative approach will not only enhance the accuracy of AI moderation but also promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the digital space.\n\nIn conclusion, our project seeks to revolutionize AI-assisted moderation by combining technological innovation with human empathy and cultural understanding. We believe that this approach will significantly improve the online environment, making it safer and more inclusive for all users."
