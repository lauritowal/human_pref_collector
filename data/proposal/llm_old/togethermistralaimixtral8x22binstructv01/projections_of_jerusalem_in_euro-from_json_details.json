        " This grant proposal titled \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\" aims to document, study, and conceptualize the interactive, multimedia re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments across hundreds of sites in Europe. By focusing on icons, maps, networks, interactive multimedia, space, and place, this project will contribute significantly to the understanding of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices.\n\nThe research activities, including field documentation, textual documentation, cross-referencing, and grouping of monuments to crystallize clusters, will have both immediate and long-term impacts. Initially, the project will produce documentation and surveys of these monuments, providing a comprehensive record of their existence and characteristics. In the long term, the project anticipates generating new insights, enabling comparative studies, and stimulating conceptualization of the relationships among these monuments.\n\nCollaborative methods, such as discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences, will ensure a multidisciplinary approach and foster a broad understanding of the subject matter. The publication plan includes various outputs throughout the stages of the project, culminating in a book that encapsulates the research and findings at the end of the project.\n\nThis research endeavor promises to significantly contribute to the fields of art history, religious studies, memory studies, and cultural geography by providing a unique perspective on the representation and conceptualization of Jerusalem in Europe. The project's anticipated outcomes will not only enrich our understanding of these monuments but also provide a foundation for further studies in related areas."
