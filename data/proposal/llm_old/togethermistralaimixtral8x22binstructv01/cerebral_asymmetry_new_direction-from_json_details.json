        " This proposal, titled \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to explore functional cerebral asymmetry, with a focus on impaired language development. Marking 150 years since Broca's groundbreaking work, our project endorses the network efficiency hypothesis. We will employ behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralization (Project A).\n\nOur hypothesis posits an increased risk for language and literacy impairment if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres (Project B). Utilizing simulations from genetic models, we will examine twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization (Project C).\n\nWe will also investigate the double hit genetic model, predicting that neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise with more than one hit on a functional brain circuit. This will be explored in individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome (Project D).\n\nLastly, we will focus on the subset of individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality. We aim to uncover rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with a departure from consistent left hemisphere language (Project E).\n\nOur multifaceted approach combines genetic and neuropsychological methodologies to advance our understanding of functional cerebral asymmetry and its implications for language development and impairment."
