        " The proposed project, \"Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World,\" aims to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model for understanding how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. This research seeks to overcome the conceptual and technical challenges inherent in studying social information representation, often exacerbated by the use of simplistic and impoverished social stimuli in experiments.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we will leverage recent advances in brain signal analysis and employ a naturalistic neuroscience approach. Our methodology will involve studying social interaction under naturalistic settings and measuring the temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals. Novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition will be utilized to test our hypotheses. These include the idea that selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, that similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with synchronous brain activity, and that intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and information flow.\n\nThe successful completion of this project could potentially contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience by improving our understanding of the brain dynamics of social interaction. This, in turn, could have significant implications for developing more effective interventions and treatments for a range of social and cognitive disorders."
