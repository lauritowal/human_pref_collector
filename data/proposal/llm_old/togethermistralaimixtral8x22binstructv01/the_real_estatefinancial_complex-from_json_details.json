        " The proposed research initiative, titled \"The Real Estate/Financial Complex,\" aims to address the under-researched connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement, starting from 2007. This project introduces a novel metaphor, the \"real estate/financial complex,\" to center attention on these interactions and bridge the existing research gap on the connection between real estate and finance, as well as the connection between different scales.\n\nThe research components involve internationally comparative research on quantitative and qualitative shifts, led by a postdoctoral researcher. Additionally, three PhD students will be tasked with conducting national mappings of the complex and local/urban case studies, each focusing on two countries. The principal investigator will concentrate on the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance, and the role of the state, the global dimensions of the complex, and the conceptualization of the complex.\n\nThis project is poised to make significant contributions to the field by providing a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between real estate, finance, and state involvement. The research findings will not only fill the existing knowledge gaps but also offer valuable insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and real estate developers to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the international comparative approach of this project will ensure that the findings are applicable across various contexts and scales."
