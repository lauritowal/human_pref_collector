        " This proposal, titled \"In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance,\" aims to investigate the transformative potential of blockchain technology on governance structures, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries. The project, named BlockchainGov, will delve into the impact of blockchain on power dynamics, legitimacy, and sustainability, while exploring its potential for enabling new models of decentralized decision-making.\n\nThe research will span across multiple disciplines, including computer science, political science, and law, and will focus on governance levels ranging from community to global. The project's objectives include a comprehensive investigation of existing blockchain governance systems, an in-depth analysis of power dynamics within these systems, and an examination of the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance. Furthermore, the project will explore the potential of blockchain technology for pioneering innovative governance models and experiment with these models at various governance levels.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this project are significant. It could open a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing empirical and theoretical contributions to the existing body of knowledge. Moreover, the project could offer valuable policy implications for global governance. To achieve these outcomes, a dedicated and motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills is required, supported by a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme. This project promises to be a groundbreaking endeavor, shedding light on the future of governance in the age of blockchain technology."
