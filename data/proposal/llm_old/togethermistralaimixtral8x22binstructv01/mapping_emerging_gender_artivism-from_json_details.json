        " The proposed project, titled \"MAPPING EMERGING GENDER ARTIVISM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ARAB PUBLIC SPACE\" (MEGAMAPS), is a transnational in-depth study focusing on Artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space post-2011. This project aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region, write a history from below, and investigate the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change.\n\nThe study will be conducted in four countries: Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, employing a multidisciplinary methodology that combines History, Social Movements Theory, Gender studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities. The research methods will include fieldwork and digital ethnography, utilizing living sources such as visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, maps, and graphic tools.\n\nThe project's objectives include framing, exploring, and mapping emerging Artivism for gender equality, producing an open access participative digital platform, documenting and systematizing a corpus of living sources, and innovating traditional approaches of History and Social Movements Theory on the Arab region. The digital platform will feature open access, participative, FAIRly accessible, and systematizing living sources.\n\nThe project's dissemination activities aim to improve activists' participation in transnational networks, promote mutual exchanges of best practices, contribute to reversing victimization paradigms on women and sexual minorities, and propose an agency paradigm to overcome orientalism and islamophobia. The target audiences include academics, stakeholders, and the general public.\n\nIn conclusion, MEGAMAPS aims to provide the first research platform for Artivism, gender, and social change in the Arab region, making the corpus FAIRly accessible to various audiences."
