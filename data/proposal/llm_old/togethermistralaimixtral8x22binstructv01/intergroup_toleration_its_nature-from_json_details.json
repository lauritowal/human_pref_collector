        " The proposed project titled \"Intergroup toleration: It’s Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\" aims to advance the state of the art in social sciences by focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration. This ground-breaking and timely research addresses the pressing question of living harmoniously in increasingly diverse societies, with an objective to provide insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration and contribute to a more tolerant society.\n\nTo achieve this, the project will delve into the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, the psychological processes underlying tolerance, the limits of tolerance, and the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. The research will employ a combination of methods, including survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, to ensure a comprehensive and robust examination of the subject matter.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its novelty and potential impact. Systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration is scarce, making this research both ground-breaking and timely. The expected outcome of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of intergroup toleration, which can inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting tolerance and harmony in culturally diverse societies. This research could potentially contribute to the development of a more tolerant society, making it a significant contribution to the field of social sciences."
