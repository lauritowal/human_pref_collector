        " The proposed project, \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe,\" aims to offer the first comprehensive exploration of the collective memory and forgetting of activism in Europe, spanning from the late 19th century to the present. This study will scrutinize three distinct periods—1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012—to uncover continuities and changes in protest depictions across various media regimes.\n\nOur objectives include demonstrating the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in transmitting memories of protest and illustrating how these memories influence subsequent movements. To achieve these goals, we will employ three lines of inquiry: mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. A significant innovation in our approach is the use of network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references, offering a new perspective on cultural memory research.\n\nThe implications of this project are profound. It promises to revolutionize cultural memory research by developing analytical tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope. Furthermore, it will pioneer a new area of social movement research and provide critical frameworks for rethinking collective memory and identity. We anticipate that this project will have a major reorienting effect on the field, opening up new avenues for research and fostering a deeper understanding of the role of cultural memory in shaping social movements."
