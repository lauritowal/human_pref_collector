        " This grant proposal, titled \"The multisensory mind: From neural mechanisms to cognition,\" aims to explore the intricate process of multisensory integration (MI) and its underlying neural and neurochemical markers. The research will employ cutting-edge methodologies, including human EEG data, source modeling of synchronized EEG activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to test a novel hypothesis regarding synchronized neural populations. By examining both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, the study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that facilitate sensory inputs merging into coherent multisensory percepts. This research will not only enhance our understanding of multisensory integration but also pave the way for potential treatments for conditions with impaired MI. The project's objectives align with the broader goal of advancing our knowledge of the human brain's complexities and its capacity to process and integrate information from multiple sensory modalities. The findings could potentially revolutionize our approach to diagnosing and treating neurological disorders, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life."
