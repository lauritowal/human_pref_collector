        " The proposed project, OLFLINK, aims to investigate 'Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption'. The overarching goal is to facilitate changes in human diets for global health and sustainability, specifically addressing the challenge of overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors. The project will delve into the cortical processes of appetitive property transfer from odor, focusing on odor-taste associative learning. Key questions to be explored include the acquisition of new flavor preferences and regulation by digestive tract signals.\n\nOLFLINK will operate at three investigation levels, with objectives that encompass determining the distributed code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations, delineating the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations, and determining interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are significant, including the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, understanding the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and developing novel interventions for dietary changes over the life course. OLFLINK will bridge the gap in understanding the processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth, providing a more comprehensive view of flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption."
