        " This proposal, titled \"Colonization, Early Institutions and the Origin of State Capacity and Democratization,\" aims to investigate the genesis of state capacity, democracy, and political dynasties. The experimental context for this study is the colonial conquest of Latin America, with a particular focus on the initial years of colonization by Spain. This period is characterized by Spanish conquerors having limited knowledge about the land, thus providing a unique opportunity to analyze the development of institutions without external influence.\n\nThe methodological approach is multifaceted, incorporating case studies, panel data, country-fixed effects, and instrumental variables. This comprehensive strategy will facilitate a deep understanding of the research subject, while also offering robustness and generalizability to the findings.\n\nOne of the key advantages of this proposal is the access to extensive and detailed documentation from the Capitulaciones and Archivo de Indias. These resources provide invaluable insights into the rules governing early institutions and the location of initial settlements at the subnational level. This information will be instrumental in understanding the origin and evolution of state capacity and democratization.\n\nThe use of case studies will allow for a nuanced exploration of the unique circumstances surrounding the establishment of these institutions, while the panel data and country-fixed effects will enable comparisons across different contexts and time periods. Furthermore, the use of instrumental variables will help establish causal relationships and mitigate potential biases.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal offers a rigorous and innovative approach to understanding the complex interplay of colonization, early institutions, and the origin of state capacity and democratization. The findings from this study will shed light on the historical roots of modern political institutions and potentially inform contemporary policy debates."
