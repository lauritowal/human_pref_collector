        " Title: Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic\n\nThis grant proposal seeks support for a comprehensive, historical, and anthropological analysis of global visual representations during the Third Plague Pandemic, spanning from 1855 to 1959. The project aims to explore how photography, a burgeoning technology of the era, influenced the depiction and understanding of the pandemic across diverse regions, including China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America.\n\nThe proposed research will be led by a principal investigator and supported by a team of three postdoctoral researchers, all committed to full-time employment. The team will delve into four key aspects of the pandemic: the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses and burial, and race, class, and discrimination.\n\nThe Third Plague Pandemic, responsible for an estimated 12 million deaths, was a pivotal period in human history. This project seeks to illuminate how visual representations of this period shaped public perception, policy, and responses to the pandemic. By examining the role of photography in documenting and disseminating information about the pandemic, we hope to gain insights into the social, cultural, and political dynamics of the time.\n\nThe findings of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of visual media in shaping public responses to pandemics, with potential implications for contemporary health crises. The project will also provide a platform for dialogue on the ethical considerations of visual representations of disease and death. We are confident that this research will make a significant contribution to the fields of history, anthropology, and public health."
