        " Our grant proposal, titled \"Rediscovering the hidden structure: A new appreciation of Juristic texts and Patterns of thought in Late Antiquity,\" aims to write a new history of the Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity, focusing on the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation and motivations. The project will highlight the persistence of a high-level legal culture, explore the study of legal texts' manuscript transmission, and delve into understanding the role of classical jurists and the analysis of emperors' legislation, as well as their relationship with the works of Roman jurists.\n\nOur cross-disciplinary research teams, comprising three groups, will engage in editing a collection of papyri and parchments, conducting workshops with European scholars, and organizing a final international conference on legal culture. These activities will result in a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and the proceedings of the international conference.\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission. By leveraging the expertise of our cross-disciplinary teams and engaging in collaborative activities, we will generate valuable outputs that contribute to the broader scholarly community and deepen our appreciation of this critical period in history. Our research will not only shed new light on the juristic texts and patterns of thought in Late Antiquity but also foster interdisciplinary dialogue and promote intellectual exchange among scholars in Europe and beyond."
