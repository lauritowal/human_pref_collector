        " The Swedish Historical Database Project aims to create a comprehensive and publicly accessible database of highly disaggregated data for approximately 2500 Swedish administrative districts, spanning the period of 1749 to 1952. The project will encompass a wide array of data content, including economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social statistics, agriculture statistics, and infrastructure investments. A key strength of this project is its focus on local-level data, providing a unique international perspective. Furthermore, the project will offer continuous and reliable population data series starting from 1749.\n\nThis project holds immense potential for research in areas such as economic growth, structural transformation, and economic development. It will employ rigorous empirical identification strategies, including instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and difference-in-differences estimation. The project builds upon related work that is currently in its second round of 'revise and resubmit' at Econometrica.\n\nLooking ahead, the project will contribute to future research plans in the areas of economic development and growth. Our team is dedicated to creating a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the wider public, enabling a deeper understanding of Sweden's historical development and its implications for present-day economic and social issues."
