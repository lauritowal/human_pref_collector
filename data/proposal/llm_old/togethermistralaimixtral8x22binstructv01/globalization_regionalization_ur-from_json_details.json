        " This research project, titled \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century,\" aims to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime perspective across three centuries. Leveraging data from the Lloyd's List register, beginning in 1734, this project seeks to provide dynamic and interactive visualizations of the spatial distribution of maritime flows on a geomatics visualization platform.\n\nThe proposed research employs graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks to analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links. Comparative analysis with general models of networks will allow for the examination of macroscopic measure evolution, including network expansion, shrinkage, concentration, and polarization.\n\nFurthermore, this project will study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development. The focus will be on the evolution of port cities and hinterlands, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. To achieve this, the project will integrate global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions.\n\nIn essence, this project exploits vessel movement data to analyze the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development over nearly 300 years. The findings of this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of globalization, regionalization, and urbanization from a maritime perspective."
