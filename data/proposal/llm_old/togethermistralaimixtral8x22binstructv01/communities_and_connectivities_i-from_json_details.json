        " Titled \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours,\" this project aims to revolutionize our understanding of Iron Age European societies through an innovative, interdisciplinary approach. Our research, set within the timeframe of 800 BC – AD 100, primarily focuses on Britain within the broader European context. Utilizing advanced methodologies such as ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological approaches, we will map genetic clusters, address population movement, and explore inter-regional connectivity. Additionally, our objectives include examining social dynamics, investigating household compositions, identifying familial relationships, analyzing gender-specific mobility, and studying the development of social inequalities. We will analyze a scale of 1000 individuals in the UK and 250 in Europe, marking the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. Our team, with expertise in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology, expects to deliver a new vision of Iron Age communities. This project will not only fill significant gaps in our knowledge of Iron Age Britain and its European connections but will also provide a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond."
