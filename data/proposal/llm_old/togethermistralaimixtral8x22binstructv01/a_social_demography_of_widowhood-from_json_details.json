        " This grant proposal, titled \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies,\" aims to address the increasing relevance of widowhood in the context of ageing societies, where survival benefits have been cut in many countries. Despite its significance, research on widowhood remains underdeveloped compared to divorce. Our project introduces four innovative approaches that explore the risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood, focusing on the probability and duration of the event, as well as its mental health and economic consequences.\n\nCurrent assessments have limitations, often focusing on changes in wellbeing after bereavement and unexpected deaths, while the prevalent scenario is terminal health decline before death. This project is structured around four pillars: risk and vulnerability, social inequalities (considering socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age), country differences, and changes over time.\n\nWe will utilize high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 60 countries, covering the period from 1985 to a projected end year of 2050. The data will be harmonized and analyzed using advanced statistical methods. Our research aims to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates of the challenges facing the widowed population and their family members. The insights gained from this project will facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems, contributing to improved societal understanding and support for widowed individuals in ageing societies."
