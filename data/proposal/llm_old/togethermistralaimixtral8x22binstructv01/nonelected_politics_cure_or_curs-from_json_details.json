        " This grant proposal, titled \"Non-elected politics: Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\", seeks to examine the impact of delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. The project is motivated by the growing disengagement of citizens from politics, historically low electoral turnout, the rise of anti-establishment and populist parties, and declining trust in representative institutions.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. This paradoxical approach contradicts representative democracy's tenet of elected control, necessitating rigorous investigation.\n\nThe research will involve a detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, and a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000. The exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy will be analyzed using online survey experiments and panel surveys.\n\nThe societal implications of this research are far-reaching. The project aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on institutional reforms for democracy revitalization. By understanding the effects of non-elected politics, we can better navigate the complexities of the current political landscape and propose informed strategies for revitalizing representative democracy in Europe."
