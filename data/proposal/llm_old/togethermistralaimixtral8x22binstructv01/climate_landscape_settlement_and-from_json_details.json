    "descriptions": [
        " The Climate, Landscape, Settlement and Society (CLaSS) project aims to explore human-environment interaction in the ancient Near East, specifically the Fertile Crescent region, covering approximately 600,000 km2, from 8000 to 2000 years Before Present (BP). Employing a hybrid research approach, CLaSS integrates archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data, leveraging General Circulation Models for climate analysis. Utilizing archaeological data science and big data techniques, the project will scrutinize population densities, distribution, subsistence practices, and landscape management strategies. The primary research goal is to investigate the factors contributing to the differential persistence of societies under changing climates. Key project impacts include providing insights into sustainability and societal resilience in the face of both abrupt and longer-term climate changes. By constructing empirical datasets, CLaSS seeks to advance our understanding of human-environment interaction, offering valuable perspectives for modern environmental and societal challenges."
