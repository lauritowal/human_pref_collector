        " This grant proposal, titled \"Jewish Translation and Cultural Transfer in Early Modern Europe,\" seeks to delve into the pivotal role of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages during the early modern period. The project aims to redefine the process of modernization in Jewish culture as a process of importing new ideas, rather than a radical departure from tradition. It will highlight how Jewish translators actively engaged with their sources, resulting in a unique corpus of Jewish literature that was in dialogue with the majority culture. This project will provide the first comprehensive study of these translations, shedding light on the intercultural encounters between Christians and Jews at the dawn of modernity. The proposed research will challenge the conventional understanding of the early modern \"Jewish book\" and Jewish modernization, offering a fresh paradigm for their interpretation. By focusing on translation as a form of cultural transfer, this project will not only enrich our understanding of Jewish history and culture but also contribute to the broader discourse on intercultural exchange and intellectual history in early modern Europe."
