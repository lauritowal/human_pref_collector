        " This proposal, titled \"Decentralized Markets with Informational Asymmetries,\" seeks to advance the theory of decentralized trade in the context of informational asymmetries and limited commitment. The project's primary objective is to explore how parties with unequal information engage in trading, and how these informational asymmetries can lead to market inefficiencies. The proposal draws upon real-world examples such as professional investors and individuals in financial markets, and consumers' private information about their willingness to pay.\n\nThe standard theory of mechanism design, while useful, often makes strong commitment assumptions and focuses on single-instance trading. This project aims to address these limitations by conducting a systematic game-theoretic analysis of decentralized markets with repeated trading and informational asymmetries. The relevance of this research is underscored by the prevalence of repeated transactions in non-durable goods and services, as well as in durable but divisible goods.\n\nThe goals of this project are multifaceted. Firstly, it aims to understand the properties of commonly used trading mechanisms in these contexts. Secondly, it seeks to explore remedies for enhanced market efficiency. Thirdly, the project intends to contribute to the design of market institutions, and lastly, to inform market regulation. By providing insights into trading mechanisms in decentralized markets, this project hopes to improve market efficiency and inform regulatory practices."
