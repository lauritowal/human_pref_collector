        " The proposed project, \"Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st-Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies,\" aims to explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and musical creativity. This interdisciplinary initiative, led by a Principal Investigator with a background in Music, Philosophy, and Computer Science/AI, seeks to understand how creative AI is reshaping our perceptions of art, culture, and society. It also examines the impact of creative AI on human relationships with technology and others. The project is structured around several work packages, including the development of instruments with creative AI, the exploration of human-AI collaboration in music, and the use of sonic instruments as scientific instruments. The primary goals are to initiate public discourse on creative AI and to develop a theoretical framework for our transformed notions of self, others, and knowledge. The project will employ a research collaboration protocol that brings together diverse scientific disciplines. The outcomes of this research include a deeper understanding of the role of creative AI in embodied technologies and a reflection of artificial intelligence in future society. The benefits of this project extend beyond the academic sphere, with the potential to develop a theoretical framework of creative AI, initiate discourse on human-centred creative AI, and define principles of ethical AI design in services and products. By using music as a platform, the project aims to establish a public understanding of AI."
