        " This grant proposal, titled \"Reinforcement Learning from Post-Ingestive Calories: From Body to Brain in Health and Disease,\" aims to investigate the post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behaviour in both rodents and humans. Our hypothesis suggests that this behaviour has a dopaminergic substrate and is linked to neural activity in brain reward circuits. The study will employ a multidisciplinary approach, utilizing computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Our primary focus will be on the selection of food, post-ingestive information, energy content, and vagus nerve information transmission in the contexts of both health and disease, with a particular emphasis on obesity. The proposed experiments include human probabilistic decision-making tasks. This research is grounded in the understanding that the drive to eat is one of the most powerful modulators of behaviour, influenced by sensory feedback and post-ingestive information about energy content. Through this study, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking behaviour, with potential implications for the prevention and treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders."
