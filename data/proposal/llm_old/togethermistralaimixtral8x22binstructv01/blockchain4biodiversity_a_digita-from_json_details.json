    "descriptions": [
        " The proposed project, Blockchain4Biodiversity, aims to develop and test ReSeed, a digital farmers' market that leverages blockchain technology to incentivize sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds (ISK) and associated know-how. With a focus on agrobiodiversity, this initiative addresses the dwindling economic incentives for ISK cultivation and conservation and the lack of intellectual property protection for ISK. By implementing a decentralized, transparent, and immutable blockchain system to track the flow of ISK, ReSeed will facilitate equitable and traceable transfers, promoting in situ conservation and encouraging honest reporting of downstream research.\n\nThe project's mixed-methods research approach involves engaging with suppliers and buyers of ISK, while recognizing the potential for minimal legal amendments and integration within existing international regulatory frameworks. Guided by ethics guidelines, ReSeed's governance model seeks to empower small farmers' communities, providing them with economic and environmental benefits.\n\nOver a 12-year period, the project has identified various benefits, including value addition to farmers' ISK, fostering research and innovation with agrobiodiversity, value addition to farmers' ISK, and promoting in situ conservation. By prioritizing ethical considerations and the potential for community impact, Blockchain4Biodiversity strives to contribute to global food security and sustainable agriculture. This project aims to create a more equitable agricultural ecosystem, ensuring that farmers' indigenous seeds and associated know-how receive the recognition and value they deserve."
