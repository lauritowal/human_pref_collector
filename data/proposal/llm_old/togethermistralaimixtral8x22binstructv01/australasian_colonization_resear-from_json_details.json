        " This grant proposal titled \"Australasian Colonization Research: Origins of Seafaring to Sahul\" aims to investigate the critical question of how the peopling of Australasia occurred by c.50,000 years ago involving seafaring. This research is significant as it addresses the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa and the earliest 'open water' crossing evidence. The project adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating archaeology, marine geophysics, hydrodynamics, and archaeogenetics.\n\nThe objectives of this project are comprehensive and include examining the When, Where, Who, and How of the earliest seafaring, researching the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf, identifying potential submerged prehistoric sites, enhancing the understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime, and resolving questions of demography and dating using mtDNA and Y-chromosome data. The geographical focus is on Sunda (South East Asia) and Sahul (Australasia).\n\nThe methodology involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining offshore and onshore environment research, and archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data. The expected outcomes of this project are substantial, including a refined knowledge of onshore/offshore environments, an understanding of human origins, insights into population dynamics and migration, knowledge of seafaring technology, and information on social organization and cognition.\n\nOverall, this project aims to tackle important questions about human origins, migration, and the technological and cognitive aspects of seafaring in the colonization of Sahul. The findings from this research will significantly contribute to our understanding of human history and the evolution of seafaring technology."
