        " This grant proposal, titled \"Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive study on the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values across various cultural contexts. Employing both library-based global comparative studies and field ethnographic studies, this research will adopt a decentering orientation to heterogeneity, focusing on the complexities of egalitarian practices and processes as cultural values. The primary objective is to integrate library and field studies, ultimately developing a robust comparative method that is responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances.\n\nThe study will be predominantly comparative in orientation, focusing on the forms and practices of egalitarianism in Europe and beyond. Key challenges to be addressed include the force, contradictions, and limitations inherent in egalitarian practices. The research will grapple with perennial questions surrounding the role of the state, religion, forms of economic distribution, and the matter of scale in shaping egalitarian practices.\n\nThe proposed project distinguishes itself through its emphasis on the cultural aspects of egalitarianism, aiming to understand the diversity of egalitarian processes. By developing a comparative method open to varieties in conceptions and imagination, this research seeks to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge on egalitarianism, providing valuable insights into its heterogeneity and complexity."
