        " This proposal, titled \"INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: what do we learn from French firm-level data?\" aims to investigate the complex interplay between innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Grounded in the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth, the research project will explore the roles of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions in driving productivity growth.\n\nThe study will delve into four key research questions. First, it will examine the factors contributing to Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, with a focus on the role of new innovations. Second, it will explore the causal links between international trade and innovation, specifically the impact of export and import on innovation dynamics. Third, the project will assess the effect of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, particularly the impact of French legislation changes on self-employment incentives. Lastly, it will investigate the relationship between creative destruction, inequality, and wellbeing, focusing on the impact of creative destruction on social mobility and health.\n\nThe research will also consider various aspects of economic growth, including the middle-income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Ultimately, the project seeks to inform the design of growth policies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and policies of innovation, and the relationship between innovation, growth, and social mobility."
