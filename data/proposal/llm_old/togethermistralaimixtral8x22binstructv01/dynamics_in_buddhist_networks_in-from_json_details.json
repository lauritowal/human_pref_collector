        " This grant proposal, titled \"Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries,\" aims to create a novel framework for understanding the intricate dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. With a focus on Buddhism, the project will explore the key elements of cultural encounter, religious transfer, and Buddhist localisations within the region between the 6th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe methodology will employ a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, aiming to reconstruct the Buddhist network during this period. The research will draw from various fields, including Philology, Art History, Archaeology, and Religious Studies. The unique perspective offered by this project lies in its analysis of religious exchange as a dynamic network, considering both spatial and temporal aspects.\n\nThe project will delve into the multi-layered relationships between various cultural entities, including Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan. By investigating the Buddhist localisations in Eastern Central Asia, this project will contribute to the broader field of Comparative Religious Studies, providing a comprehensive understanding of how Buddhism evolved and was integrated into these diverse cultures.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to provide a holistic view of the religious and cultural landscape of Eastern Central Asia during this period, offering new insights into the complex dynamics of religious transfer and cultural exchange."
