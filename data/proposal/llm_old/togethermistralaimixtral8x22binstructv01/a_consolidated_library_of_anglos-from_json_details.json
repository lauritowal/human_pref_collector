        " The proposed project, \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry,\" aims to create an interactive online library of all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse, spanning the period of c. 670–1100 CE. This comprehensive corpus will include Old English and Anglo-Latin poetry, totaling approximately 60,000 lines, equally divided between the two languages. The project will focus on documenting the influence of 50 named poets and tracing the potential influence of anonymous verse. The texts, usually found in manuscripts, will be marked up using TEI P5 XML, ensuring accessibility and searchability.\n\nThe library will also incorporate digital resources such as sound-files and image-files, enhancing the user experience and aiding research. Additionally, the project will organize conferences and workshops to promote the library and its resources. A series of publications will be produced, focusing on the creation of a comprehensive multilingual corpus, contributing to the understanding of the coexistence of Latin and Anglo-Saxon vernacular in a Christian context across Europe.\n\nThe proposed project has the potential to significantly impact research in Anglo-Saxon poetry and related fields. By providing a consolidated, interactive, and accessible library of these texts, the project will facilitate new avenues of research and enable scholars to explore the influence of these poets in a broader context."
