        " The proposed project, \"Causes and Consequences of Labor Market Flexibility\" (LABFLEX), aims to investigate the underlying factors and implications of labor market flexibility in the context of globalization, technological advancements, and workplace transformation. The research will delve into the developments of outsourcing, sub-contracting, flexible scheduling, and flexible pay jobs, with a particular focus on their impact on wage inequality and the division of resources in society.\n\nThe project's primary objectives include exploring the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, with key questions revolving around job contract differences, wage inequality, gender wage gaps, worker compensation for adverse conditions, shifts in rent sharing between workers and firms, and the role of labor market institutions and policies.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will employ a combination of innovative methods, including linking register data to experimental evidence on worker preferences, analyzing a full-text corpus of vacancies with job attribute information, and combining experimental and structural methods.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the generation of new evidence on the causes and consequences of labor market flexibility, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the supply and demand sides of the labor market. This project is poised to provide valuable insights that can inform policy-making and contribute to more equitable labor market practices."
