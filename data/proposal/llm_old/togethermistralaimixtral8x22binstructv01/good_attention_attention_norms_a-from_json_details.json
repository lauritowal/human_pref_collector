        " Title: Good Attention: Attention Norms and their Role in Practical Reason, Epistemology, and Ethics\n\nThe proposed project, GOODATTENTION, aims to provide a ground-breaking, interdisciplinary philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for understanding them. Spanning fields such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, ethics, evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, economics, and political theory, this project will explore the emergence of attention norms within individual psychology and the social domain.\n\nOur primary goal is to evaluate attention norms by integrating them into normative philosophy, with a central hypothesis that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. To test this, we will conduct research activities including investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social relevance in guiding attention by social norms, considering the role of attention norms in decision-making, and analyzing the ethical rights and duties regarding attention.\n\nExpected impacts of this project include influencing philosophical fields by integrating norms of attention and providing an analytical framework for policy-making. Our novel conceptual framework, based on priority structures that organize the mind, will offer a unified foundation for the study of attention norms. By understanding how attention norms emerge and operate, we can develop more effective strategies for decision-making, ethical considerations, and policy development."
