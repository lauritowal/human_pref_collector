        " This grant proposal, titled \"Sustainable and healthy food solutions: system dynamics and trade-offs,\" seeks to revolutionize global agri-food production, trade, and consumption through the FLORA project. The project's objectives are threefold: to contribute to a transformation of global agri-food systems, create essential evidence for implementing shifts in practices and behaviors, and identify the most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics.\n\nThe FLORA project will employ a systemic approach to diagnose the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally. Utilizing system dynamics and complex network analyses, key threats and opportunities will be identified to inform the development and evaluation of tailored solutions. This interdisciplinary research will draw upon the Principal Investigator's extensive experience in leading collaborative studies focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.\n\nThe project's focus areas include sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption. By adopting a comprehensive, interdisciplinary perspective, the FLORA project aims to generate transformative insights and recommendations that will enable the global community to navigate the complex challenges and opportunities inherent in the pursuit of sustainable and healthy food systems."
