        " This grant proposal, titled \"NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,\" aims to address the limitations of current building modeling tools, which primarily focus on physical and material characteristics. These tools often neglect critical context, intended use, and user considerations, leading to inadequate representation of buildings and evaluations based solely on physical aspects such as lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability. Consequently, architects and designers are unable to predict a building's impact on future users' lives and activities, nor can they adequately assess whether a building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nOur research aims to develop a comprehensive building modeling method, incorporating form, function, and use information into building models. By doing so, we seek to overcome the limitations of existing tools and improve building design processes. This proposed research is grounded in the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth. Our innovative approach will enhance the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment, ultimately leading to better-designed buildings that cater to the needs and behaviors of their intended users.\n\nThis proposal argues for the development of advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems that include user behavior and context, thereby improving building design and creating more user-centric built environments. The successful implementation of this research will revolutionize the architectural and design industries, fostering a more holistic approach to building design that considers the complex interplay between human behavior and the built environment."
