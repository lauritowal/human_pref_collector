        " The proposed project, \"Florilegia Syriaca: The Intercultural Dissemination of Greek Christian Thought in Syriac and Arabic in the First Millennium CE,\" aims to illuminate the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic during the first millennium CE, a period of cultural mediation that remains little-known today. The project's objectives include defining the religious identity of Syriac Christians, creating open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia, and studying the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to shed light on the cultural creativity laboratories of Syriac florilegia, a shared heritage of both European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures, and its role in bridging the intellectual history of Europe and the Middle East during the patristic canon period of the 2nd-6th centuries. The project's groundbreaking endeavors include the production of digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th-10th centuries and the study of neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors from the 8th-11th centuries.\n\nThe potential research outcomes of this project are far-reaching, with the potential to improve our understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity, the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge between intellectual histories, and the comprehension of Europe's current religious discourses. Additionally, this project could contribute to the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians. The proposed strategies, which center around the production of florilegia (anthologies), will create new opportunities for interdisciplinary research and collaboration in the fields of religious studies, cultural history, and digital humanities."
