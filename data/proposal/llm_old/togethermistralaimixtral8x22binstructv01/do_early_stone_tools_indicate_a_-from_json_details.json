        " Title: Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture?\n\nThis grant proposal, named STONECULT, aims to investigate the origins of human culture by testing whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions. The research question at the heart of this project is: \"When did forms of culture first arise in our lineage?\" It is widely accepted that cultural adaptations are critical for human colonization of the planet, making the origin of human culture a pressing scientific question.\n\nSTONECULT seeks to challenge the assumption that early hominin technology relied on the same social learning mechanisms as modern humans. Instead, it posits that the latent solutions model may better explain early hominin stone tools than high fidelity copying. This proposal is the first to test the new latent solutions account of early stone tools.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, STONECULT will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, comparing early hominin technologies to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches. The potential impact of this research is significant. It could inform fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. If latent solutions are confirmed, it would transform our understanding of human culture evolution by suggesting that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed.\n\nIn summary, STONECULT offers a unique opportunity to explore the origins of human culture and challenge existing assumptions about early hominin technology. Its findings could have profound implications for our understanding of human evolution and culture."
