        " Title: \"The New Flow of News: How Social Network Sites Transform News Organizations and Citizens' Political Behavior\"\n\nThis project aims to investigate the evolving relationship between traditional news organizations and social network sites (SNS), as well as their collective impact on citizens' political beliefs and behavior. As traditional news media declines and SNS attention increases, this research explores the transition within the industry and how news is now conceptualized as a social product. The project goals are twofold: to explore the process of news production and consumption in the context of SNS, and to reveal the implications of these changes on political beliefs and behavior.\n\nThe study will employ innovative approaches, including big data analysis and small-N in-depth designs, to examine the new model of news distribution, consumption, and influence. Key actors in this model include news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees, all of whom will be studied through interviews, traffic data analysis, and content analysis.\n\nThe project also plans to measure users' behavior through laboratory observation, surfing behavior measurement, and physiological attention indices. To understand the long-term political effects, a two-year spanning period will be used to collect survey panel data and web-based behavioral data.\n\nThe research will contribute to a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, setting a new methodological standard for audience research. By examining how the integration of SNS into news platforms is affecting news production and audiences' political behavior, this project promises to provide valuable insights into the changing landscape of news and its impact on society."
