        " Title: NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception (NEMERO)\n\nThe NEMERO project aims to unravel the enigmatic neuronal mechanisms governing conscious perception, addressing the intriguing question of why some visual stimuli are consciously perceived while others are not. Building upon our lab's previous work demonstrating that weak simple stimuli can be reported with minimal frontal cortex activity, we will delve deeper into the relationship between conscious perception, attention, and working memory.\n\nOur research will focus on comparing the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across most brain regions. The visual cortex, acting as a relay station for simple stimuli, will be of particular interest, along with its interaction with associative brain regions for complex stimuli perception.\n\nTo achieve this, we will employ a multi-faceted approach, including measuring the activity of single neurons in human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy using implanted electrodes, recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey, and characterizing neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will also utilize perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys to measure a 'functional connectome' and investigate brain regions where activity does or does not lead to a reportable experience.\n\nThe expected outcomes of NEMERO are anticipated to provide invaluable insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception. The results could pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders and enhance our understanding of the fundamental principles of consciousness."
