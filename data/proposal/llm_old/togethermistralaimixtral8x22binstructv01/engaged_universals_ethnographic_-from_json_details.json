        " This grant proposal, titled \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the public good in Africa,\" presents an anthropological study focusing on the policy of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and its implications for the public good across Africa. UHC, as defined by the World Health Organization, aims to ensure that all individuals can access necessary health services without enduring financial hardship. This policy is also a critical component of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe proposal addresses historical challenges in Africa, such as structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, privatization, the burden of payment on the poor, and the neglect of national healthcare systems, leading to a lack of citizens' trust. The research will explore the characteristics of UHC, including state responsibility and the concept of public good, as well as the challenges of partial pursuit by African states and conflicting interests in this contested field.\n\nThe research focuses on actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, examining the relations between states and citizens, formal systems of social protection, and informal social networks supporting health. It also considers national histories and social practices. The methodological approach is ethnographic, employing multi-sited and multi-level features to capture the complexity of UHC implementation.\n\nThe expected contributions of this project include new research directions and knowledge of relevance beyond Africa. This study aims to reveal how UHC is interpreted and implemented in three African countries, thereby illuminating its impact on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions. Ultimately, this research seeks to inform policy and practice, promoting more equitable and effective health coverage across Africa."
