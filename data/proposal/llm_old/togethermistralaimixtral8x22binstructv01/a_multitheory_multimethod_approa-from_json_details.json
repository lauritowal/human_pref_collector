        " This grant proposal, titled \"A Multi-Theory Multi-Method Approach for Preventing and Reducing Radicalization leading to Violence,\" aligns with the UN Decade of Action (2020-2030) and focuses on combating violent extremism. The project aims to address the current shortcomings in theoretical consensus about the nature and causes of radicalization, infrequent access to populations of interest, and methodological limitations such as lack of comparative studies and over-reliance on qualitative data.\n\nThe project is structured into four work packages. The first work package will develop a multi-theory model for understanding radicalization and deradicalization. The second will create an innovative methodology for data collection on these phenomena. The third work package will examine mechanisms of radicalization inside and outside prisons in ten nations, including Spain, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan, using interviews and experiments. The final work package will develop evidence-based programs for preventing radicalization in prisons and conducting deradicalization.\n\nThe project's contributions will be twofold. Scientifically, it will collect unique empirical data from samples of violent extremist offenders worldwide, enhancing our understanding of radicalization. Practically, it will provide novel evidence-based strategies and tools for predicting and preventing violent extremism. This project will significantly contribute to the global fight against violent extremism by providing a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to understanding and addressing radicalization."
