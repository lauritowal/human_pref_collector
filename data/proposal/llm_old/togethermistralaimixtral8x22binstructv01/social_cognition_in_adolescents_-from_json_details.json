        " The proposed project, \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks,\" aims to integrate social network research and social brain research, focusing on adolescents as the target population. This longitudinal study, with a cohort size of 1000 and spanning 50 classes, will explore the dynamic interplay between social networks and the social brain during adolescent development. The research will employ social network analysis and a social neuroscience experimental approach, focusing on social-cognitive functions such as understanding and interacting with others.\n\nMeasurements will be taken six times over three years, with a subsample of 100 participants undergoing yearly fMRI scans. The experimental tasks and assessment techniques, including ecological momentary assessment, will provide insights into the participants' social cognition. The project will leverage data from surveys and mobile sensing to analyze social networks.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to clarify how changes in the social brain correspond to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development. The findings from this project could significantly contribute to our understanding of adolescent social cognition, potentially informing interventions and policies aimed at supporting healthy social development during this critical period."
