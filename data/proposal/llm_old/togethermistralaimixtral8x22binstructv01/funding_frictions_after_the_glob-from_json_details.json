        " This proposal, titled \"Funding Frictions after the Global Financial Crisis,\" aims to investigate the impact of funding frictions on financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies in the post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era. The project will focus on understanding funding frictions, optimizing policy responses, and reducing funding risk for these institutions. The study will examine significant events such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the March 2020 Covid-19 market turmoil to explore how market developments since the GFC have affected funding frictions. Key manifestations of these frictions include elevated external financing costs, shorter debt maturities, and lack of credit market access.\n\nThe project will scrutinize several market changes, including ballooning deficits in developed economies, tighter Money Market Mutual funds regulation, pension risk transfers to life insurance companies, and tighter bank regulation (Basel III). By addressing these areas, the research aims to provide insights on funding costs and credit market access, as well as debt management strategies for sovereigns. Furthermore, it seeks to enhance policy maker awareness of regulatory consequences, as they strive to reduce funding risk and optimize policy responses.\n\nUltimately, this study hopes to contribute to the broader understanding of funding frictions and their impact on financing conditions. The expected outcomes will not only benefit the affected entities but also aid policy makers in devising informed strategies to mitigate funding risk and improve financing conditions in the post-GFC era."
