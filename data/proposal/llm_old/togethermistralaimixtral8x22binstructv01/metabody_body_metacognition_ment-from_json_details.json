        " The METABODY proposal introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining, a dynamic inference of body image derived from prior expectations and new information. This project aims to explore the negotiation between invariance and invention in the context of modern body image phenomena and identity balance. The study focuses on body image as a dynamic inference, emphasizing the equilibrium between prior beliefs and new information, and investigating the metacognitive level of this process.\n\nOur hypothesis suggests that body image disturbances are linked to first and second-order abilities. To test this, we have designed three empirical work packages: 'Body Metacognition,' focusing on the balance between embodied experience and external perspectives; 'Body Mentalizing,' exploring the equilibrium between embodied experience and social perspectives; and 'Body Decision Making,' examining the balance between current, future, and ideal body perspectives.\n\nThe ultimate goal of METABODY is to understand the intricate process of identity negotiation in the context of the ever-growing body modification options. This research will provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between body image, metacognition, mentalization, and metamorphosis, contributing to the existing body of knowledge in this field and potentially informing interventions for individuals experiencing body image disturbances."
