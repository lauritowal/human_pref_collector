        " Title: A Computational Approach to Early Language Bootstrapping\n\nThis project aims to develop a computational model simulating the early language acquisition process in infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months, focusing on Japanese, French, and Dutch languages. Utilizing machine learning and automatic speech recognition, we will define fine-grained and coarse-grained coding features for speech. Word segmentation in raw speech will be another focus, acknowledging the distinctive nature of infant lexicon compared to adult lexicon.\n\nA predictive model of coarticulation in auditory space will be created using reverse coarticulation processes. Approximate representations for phonemes, words, and contextual rules will be iteratively integrated, with numerical assessments conducted on adult-directed and infant-directed speech databases.\n\nOur approach will be validated through behavioral studies, EEGs, and fNIRS, providing a multi-dimensional perspective on infant language development. Artificial languages and longitudinal studies will be employed for prediction testing, with comparative analysis conducted against state-of-the-art supervised phoneme recognizers.\n\nThis innovative research will significantly contribute to our understanding of early language acquisition, potentially revolutionizing language learning methodologies. It will also provide valuable insights for speech therapy and language pathology, enhancing our ability to support children with language development difficulties. Furthermore, this project aligns with the broader goal of advancing computational linguistics and artificial intelligence."
