        " The proposed project, \"Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent,\" aims to conduct Neolithic archaeological research on animal domestication, with a focus on the early evidence of sheep and goat management in key regions such as the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent. The research employs biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth to investigate mechanisms including control of animals’ reproductive cycles, changes to animals’ feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements.\n\nAnalyses targets include faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers. By examining these variables, the project seeks to unravel paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identify how human societies changed the animals, discover early caprine management practices, and establish when and where animal domestication processes began.\n\nThis research will not only deepen our understanding of early human-animal interactions in the Fertile Crescent but also contribute to broader discussions on the origins of agriculture and the development of complex human societies. The findings will be of significant interest to archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians, and will provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and modern animal husbandry practices."
