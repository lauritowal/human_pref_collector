        " This proposal, \"Meeting Darwin's last challenge: toward a global tree of human languages and genes,\" aims to address the weaknesses of current language classification methods by integrating the latest advancements in molecular biology, formal and typological linguistics, and biostatistics. The project's theoretical impact lies in the rise of molecular biology's contribution to the historical classification of species and populations, as advocated by Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994). We propose a correspondence between language families and classical genetic markers to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as the narrow scope of classical methods and the probabilistic unreliability of mass comparison. We adopt the approach of Longobardi and Guardiano (2009), which utilizes grammatical evidence and advances in formal and typological linguistics. This method offers unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, and can measure linguistic distances between remote populations. Our collaborative approach will see linguists and biologists jointly select significant populations for language and gene sampling. The project will employ powerful genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, markers of the Y chromosome, and markers of mitochondrial DNA, along with biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity. Ultimately, this project aims to realize Darwin's prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations."
