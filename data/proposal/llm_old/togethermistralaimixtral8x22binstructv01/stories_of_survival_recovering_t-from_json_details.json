        " The proposed project, \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World,\" aims to uncover and analyze the global migration of Eastern Christians from the sixteenth century onwards, focusing on their journeys from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. This transnational project employs a global and connected histories framework to explore the experiences of Eastern Christians in the early modern world.\n\nLed by a team of multiple researchers under the supervision of a Principal Investigator, the project will scrutinize source materials from three continents, written in ten languages and housed in dozens of archives. The primary challenge lies in linking micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history, which the team will address using philology and source criticism methodologies.\n\nThe project will cover fields such as Middle Eastern history, European history, and global history. Research findings will be disseminated through print publications and workshops. Additionally, a searchable database will be developed as a tool to facilitate further research and understanding of the subject.\n\nThe project's time period spans from 1500 to 1750, a critical era in the history of Eastern Christianity. The proposed project will not only contribute to the existing body of knowledge but also provide valuable insights into the lives and journeys of Eastern Christians during this transformative period. The creation of a searchable database will further enhance the accessibility and utility of the research findings."
