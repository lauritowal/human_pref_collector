        " The proposed project, \"MetCogCon: Metacognition of Concepts,\" aims to explore the thoughts and feelings that accompany the use of concepts, a crucial aspect of human cognitive capabilities. Concepts, as tools for thought, vary in their dependability and suitability, yet our understanding of how we metacognitively manage them remains limited. This project will focus on key concepts such as GENE, MEME, RACE, and SPECIES, with the goal of elucidating how metacognition influences our decision to rely on, reject, or embrace these concepts, and how it affects the selection of concepts for reasoning and induction.\n\nCurrently, the metacognition of concepts is poorly understood, lacking a clear theoretical framework. This project will bridge this gap by combining analytic methods from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, employing psychological model-building, and conducting experimental investigations.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are significant. By improving our understanding of cognitive control and addressing philosophical problems, we can inform reasoning policies in everyday and scientific/philosophical contexts, and thereby determine the reliability of heuristics in concept selection. This could lead to enhanced understanding of a fundamental aspect of the human mind.\n\nIn conclusion, \"MetCogCon\" offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of metacognition, with potential applications in various fields. By combining interdisciplinary approaches and focusing on key concepts, this project promises to deliver valuable insights into a relatively unexplored area of human cognition."
