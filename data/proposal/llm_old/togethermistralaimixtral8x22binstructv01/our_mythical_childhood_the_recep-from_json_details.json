        " The proposed project, \"Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges,\" aims to develop a pioneering approach to the reception of Classical Antiquity in children's and young adults' culture. This international team of scholars seeks to offer insights into identity formation and initiation into adulthood, exploring the reception of Antiquity as reshaped in response to regional and global challenges. While current research has a selective focus mainly on Western culture, this project proposes solutions such as applying regional perspectives without pejorative implications and conducting comparative studies of reception models across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. The innovation lies in the comparative studies across various regions, including non-traditional ones for Graeco-Roman tradition. The research aims to provide a deeper understanding of key social, political, and cultural transformations, with broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture. Deliverables include a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children. The project's goals are to contribute to integration and stimulate cultural exchange. Overall, the project explores how Classical Antiquity is received and reshaped in children’s and young adults’ culture across different regions, addressing both regional and global challenges."
