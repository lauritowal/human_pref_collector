        " This grant proposal, entitled \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56),\" seeks to achieve a breakthrough in understanding the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by studying early Franciscan thought. The project challenges the assumption that early Franciscans merely codified past work, instead highlighting their innovative contributions to the philosophical discourse. Utilizing a 'practice-led' hermeneutic for reading scholastic texts, this research will consider the influence of practice on theory, thereby providing a more nuanced perspective on the development of early Franciscan thought.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are to produce the first comprehensive study of sources, method, content, and later medieval reception of early Franciscan thought, identify novelty in early Franciscan work (including the use of Islamic sources), draw connections between early and late Franciscan schools, and showcase the shared Muslim-Western philosophical identity. Ultimately, this research aims to provide a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought, emphasizing how Franciscan ideas became modern when removed from their original practice-led context. By re-envisioning the state of the art in the study of scholasticism, this project will significantly advance our understanding of the foundations of modern Western philosophy and the interplay of religious and philosophical traditions in the development of Western thought."
