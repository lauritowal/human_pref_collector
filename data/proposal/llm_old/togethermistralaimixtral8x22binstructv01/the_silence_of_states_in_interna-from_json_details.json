        " Title: The Silence of States in International Law\n\nThis groundbreaking project, \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" aims to conduct the first comprehensive study on the implications of State silence in international law. The proposed research will offer a novel taxonomy of State silences and scrutinize their legal consequences, thus contributing significantly to existing knowledge. By examining State practice in all six official UN languages, analyzing international jurisprudence and literature, and performing empirical analysis of reasoning from government officials and international judges, this project seeks to shed light on the binding nature of State silence, the role of State inaction in responsibility, and its impact on international dispute settlement proceedings. The research findings are expected to provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, including States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals. Crucially, the project will critically evaluate whether changes in international law are necessary concerning State silence. Ultimately, this research endeavors to foster a more profound understanding of State silence and its legal implications, thereby enriching the discourse on international law and promoting more informed decision-making among relevant stakeholders."
