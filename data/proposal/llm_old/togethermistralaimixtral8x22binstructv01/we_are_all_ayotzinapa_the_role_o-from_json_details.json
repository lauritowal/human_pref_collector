        " This grant proposal, titled \"We are all Ayotzinapa: The Role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance,\" aims to explore the pivotal role of digital media in shaping transnational memories surrounding disappearances, with a particular focus on the case of 43 students who disappeared in Mexico in September 2014. The study will delve into the significance of new media in shaping citizen engagement and counter-movements against the Mexican government.\n\nThe proposed project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on theoretical frameworks related to disappearance as a crime and digital memory. This will be complemented by a comparative analysis, examining Mexico's case in relation to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina.\n\nThe primary output of this research will be a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope. This model will be instrumental in understanding the ontological status of the disappeared and the role of digital memory in transgressing boundaries.\n\nThe proposed research is of utmost significance as it will contribute to current discourses on digital media and its impact on societal and political dynamics, particularly in the context of human rights violations and government accountability. The project's findings will have implications for digital memory studies, transnational movements, and the broader understanding of disappearance as a global phenomenon."
