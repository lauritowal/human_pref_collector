        " The SCALEFORES project aims to develop and validate a pioneering methodological framework for mapping relationships between ecosystem services using existing data. By addressing the challenge of reliably mapping relationships between multiple ecosystem services, this project will facilitate multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. Our approach involves examining the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and their underlying social and ecological variables, leading to the creation of maps that accurately depict trade-offs and win-wins between these services.\n\nThe proposed methodology will be validated against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe, a region with the most comprehensive data on ecosystem services globally. Anticipated outcomes include accurate maps of relationships between ecosystem services and an increased ability to map their distributions. These outcomes will be achieved using data sources such as land cover, soil type, and human population density.\n\nBy successfully implementing the SCALEFORES project, we expect to significantly enhance our understanding of ecosystem service dynamics and support more effective and sustainable landscape management practices. This project will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on ecosystem services, providing valuable insights for policymakers, conservationists, and other stakeholders working towards the sustainable use and management of our natural resources."
