        " This grant proposal, titled \"Representational preconditions for understanding other minds in the service of human collaboration and social learning,\" aims to explore the empirical implications of a novel theoretical approach to the early representational preconditions and the functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. The proposal challenges standard theories that suggest representing others' beliefs is effortful and late developing, with its primary function being to explain others' behavior. Instead, it posits that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. This paradigm shift is motivated by recent evidence showing infants understand mental states by the second year, and our own research findings indicate that the mechanisms are present from as early as 7 months of age, with infants and adults automatically computing others' beliefs even when not required. The research goals include exploring functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, charting the developmental unfolding of these abilities, and investigating the implications of the proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. The project will focus on cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, specifically the automatic processes involved in social interactions. Key references informing this proposal include Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and Kovacs et al. (in press Science)."
