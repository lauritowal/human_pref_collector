        " The proposed project, entitled \"Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube\" (STRADA), aims to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system to investigate the spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier. This innovative approach will introduce dynamic simulations into historical research, facilitating a deeper understanding of the ancient transport system's operations and its influence on the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire.\n\nSTRADA's primary objectives include reconstructing ancient land and water routes, determining the performance of various transport modes under fluctuating environmental conditions, and creating a time-related simulation system. The simulation system will incorporate local fine granular topography, historical weather data, and variable means of transport with different loads. Additionally, the model will account for human factors such as fatigue, necessary rest periods, and loading times.\n\nThe project's design approach emphasizes a modular design for sustainable use and future extension, ensuring the system's longevity and adaptability. STRADA will focus on three distinct geographical areas—Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscapes—to provide comprehensive insights into the ancient transport network's complexity and efficiency.\n\nBy combining technological developments, experimental data, and historical research, STRADA will simulate realistic transport times, offering a unique perspective on the Roman Empire's economic cohesion. This project will significantly contribute to the field of historical research, bridging the gap between technological innovation and ancient societal organization."
