        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Role of Reputation and Corruption in Procurement,\" presents three empirical projects aimed at enhancing our understanding of the intricate relationship between corruption and reputation in the procurement process, spanning across sectors such as defense, transportation, education, and healthcare. The overarching goal is to develop strategies that avoid waste, enhance social welfare, prevent corruption, and ensure contractor compliance.\n\nThe first project focuses on the use of reputation in contract procurement, exploring the impacts of a vendor rating system on contractor performance improvement, changes in procurement costs, corruption concerns, and new bidder entry. The second project delves into the issue of corruption in public procurement, analyzing the extent of criminal networks, the effectiveness of awarding rules against corruption, and developing corruption detection tests.\n\nThe third project specifically targets healthcare procurement regulations, conducting a descriptive analysis of EU practices, evaluating the impact of discretionary awarding rules on corruption and reputation, and assessing these practices in terms of patients' welfare.\n\nBy executing these projects, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the field of procurement, enabling the development of more efficient, transparent, and corruption-free procurement processes that ultimately benefit society as a whole."
