        " This proposal, titled \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture,\" posits that Ireland has a distinct and under-researched history of cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome, despite not being part of the Roman Empire. The research will focus on nine themes: language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence. It will employ a multi-thematic, heuristic framework, fostering a dialogue between classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English and Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The project is particularly relevant given contemporary preoccupations with the politics and history of Ireland, including the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state (1912-1922) and the ongoing violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland. The expected impact of this research includes the opening of new avenues of investigation, the elucidation of classical culture's influence on literary, social, and political discourse, and a broadening of the historical influence period beyond the past 100 years. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the unique classical influences that have shaped Irish culture."
