        " This grant proposal, titled \"Effort and Social Inequality: Advancing Measurement and Understanding Parental Origin Effects,\" aims to investigate the role of effort in the reproduction of social inequality and intergenerational mobility, with an overarching goal of improving equality of opportunity. The research will focus on school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany, employing cutting-edge methods of effort measurement, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry.\n\nThe project seeks to answer three primary research questions: (1) How do children's effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background? (2) Can existing disparities in effort by social background be explained by the intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations? (3) What are the best techniques to measure cognitive effort, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of these measures?\n\nData will be collected through experimental methods and subjective effort dispositions using (inter)national surveys. The triangulation of methodologies and cross-validation analysis will ensure robust data analysis.\n\nIf funded, this project will provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and stimulate new research on effort differentials by gender or ethnicity. Furthermore, it will offer insights for educational practitioners and contribute to normative debates about social inequality and policy design. Overall, this research will provide new insights into how effort contributes to the persistence of social inequality and propose methods to measure and understand this phenomenon."
