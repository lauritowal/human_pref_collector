        " In our grant proposal, \"Emotional Learning in Social Interaction,\" we aim to unravel the mechanisms underlying aversive learning about others, from others through observation, and during interaction. Our objectives are to build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning, with a focus on stimulus-bound factors like ethnic group belonging and emotional expressiveness, as well as conceptual factors such as moral and social status, empathy, and mental state attributions. Our methods include experimental manipulations, novel behavioral paradigms, manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. We anticipate the involvement of affective, associative, social cognitive, and instrumental/goal-directed networks, with a distinctive focus on a social-cognitive network for social learning and a fourth network for social learning through interactions and shaping of behavioral norms. The potential impacts of our research are far-reaching, with the potential to enhance our understanding of group conflicts and norm compliance, as well as provide insights into social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. Through this comprehensive study of emotional learning and its role in social interaction, we hope to contribute significantly to the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and social sciences."
