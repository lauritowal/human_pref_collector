        " This proposal, titled \"Inequality-aware Market Design,\" aims to explore the optimal design of marketplaces, considering the presence of inequalities. The project employs the Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD) theoretical framework and a mechanism-design methodology to address the conventional opposition of allocative inefficiency in policies such as rent control, health care, and transit.\n\nThe main hypothesis is that when inequalities are detectable, it may be necessary to sacrifice allocative efficiency for a more desirable surplus split. Participants in the marketplace will provide private information on their willingness to trade and welfare weights. Potential outcomes may include inefficient rationing.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of this project is twofold. Firstly, it addresses inequality in market-design settings, distinguishing it from the traditional mechanism-design focus on efficiency and revenue. Secondly, it complements the public-finance approach through the tax system by explaining distortionary market interventions in light of inequality concerns.\n\nThe goal of this project is to maximize welfare with redistributive preferences, providing policymakers with a welfare function that allows them to introduce rules constraining transactions and distribute scarce resources without markets. This research will offer valuable insights into the design of marketplaces that consider inequalities, contributing to more equitable and efficient policies."
