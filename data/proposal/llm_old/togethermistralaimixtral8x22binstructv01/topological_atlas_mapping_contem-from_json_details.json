        " The proposed research project, \"Topological Atlas: Mapping Contemporary Borderscapes,\" aims to develop a transdisciplinary research program that employs digital technologies, GIS, and Google Earth to map, analyze, and intervene in the complex and dynamic nature of contemporary borders. The project will adopt a topological approach to understanding borders as porous, shifting, and solidified entities that are open for some and impenetrable for others. The research will focus on issues such as the mobility of geopolitical territorial formations, the operation of borders beyond legal frameworks, and the variable enforcement of treaties, using examples such as the formation of ISIS and the opening and closing of European borders.\n\nThe project will employ visual counter-geographies and participative methodologies to produce maps that represent seamless transitions between spaces occupied by migrants and security apparatuses. The research will challenge traditional cartographic norms by adapting to situations of crisis and researching border areas beyond top-down perspectives. The proposed research question is: \"How can mapping be used to represent borders as topological entities through the experience of those who encounter them?\"\n\nThe project acknowledges the relationship between academic inquiry, knowledge production, and the impact of knowledge, and seeks to contribute to ongoing debates on the role of borders in shaping contemporary societies. The project will produce visual and co-produced forms of knowledge that will be disseminated through a digital atlas, with the aim of disrupting traditional understandings of borders and promoting more nuanced and complex representations of contemporary borderscapes."
