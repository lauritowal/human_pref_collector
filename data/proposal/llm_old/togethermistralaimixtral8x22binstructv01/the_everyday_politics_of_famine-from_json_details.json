        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Everyday Politics of Famine,\" aims to investigate the persistent and increasingly lethal occurrence of famines, with 250,000 individuals experiencing famine in 2022 and 35 million more on the brink. Our research will focus on the everyday politics of famine within affected communities, with the overarching goal of understanding why famines persist and how blame is displaced for famine suffering.\n\nOur research will employ an ethnographically-informed comparative study in South Sudan and Somalia, examining various aspects such as community narratives, histories, musical memories of past famines, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. The research team, predominantly comprised of Somali and South Sudanese members, brings a wealth of previous experience, established networks, and a proven track record in the field.\n\nThe proposed project seeks to contribute to a significant shift in the science of famine politics, challenging the normalization of these deadly phenomena. By delving into the everyday politics of famine, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform policies and practices to mitigate the impact of famines and prevent their recurrence. This research will not only add to the existing body of knowledge on famine but also offer practical solutions to a pressing global issue."
