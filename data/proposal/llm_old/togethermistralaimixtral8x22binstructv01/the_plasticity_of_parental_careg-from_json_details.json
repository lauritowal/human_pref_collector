        " Title: The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting\n\nAbstract: This proposal aims to comprehensively investigate the neural underpinnings of parental caregiving in new parents, focusing on both typical and atypical developmental trajectories. By employing a multi-faceted approach involving neuroimaging and psychological testing, we seek to unravel the intricate brain changes that accompany the emergence and refinement of parenting behaviors.\n\nOur research design encompasses three interconnected subprojects. Subproject 1 involves a longitudinal study examining the normal development of parental caregiving in both women and men. Beginning before pregnancy, this study will monitor structural and functional brain changes, as well as behavioral measures on caregiving tasks, to capture the dynamic neuroplasticity associated with this crucial life transition.\n\nSubproject 2 adopts a cross-sectional design to explore the impact of disrupted development of parental caregiving. Specifically, we will examine the brain and behavioral effects on caregiving in the context of parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormality, such as cleft lip and palate.\n\nFinally, Subproject 3 will synthesize the findings from the previous subprojects to identify the fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. Utilizing advanced computational models, we aim to provide a mechanistic account of the neurobiological processes involved in parental caregiving and its disruptions.\n\nIn summary, this project promises to advance our understanding of the neural bases of parenting, with potential implications for intervention and support strategies in cases of disrupted development."
