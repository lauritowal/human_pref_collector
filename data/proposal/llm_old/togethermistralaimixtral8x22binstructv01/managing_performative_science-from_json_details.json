        " Title: Managing Performative Science (MAPS)\n\nThis grant proposal aims to launch the Managing Performative Science (MAPS) project, which focuses on the understudied yet critical issue of performativity in science. The project will explore the philosophical implications of performativity in scientific prediction, explanation, and ethical considerations, with a particular focus on economics, epidemiology, and machine learning.\n\nThe primary objectives of MAPS are threefold. Firstly, the project aims to develop a novel understanding of performativity in the aforementioned scientific disciplines, contributing to the broader philosophy of science. Secondly, MAPS will assess the ethical risks associated with performativity, shedding light on the potential consequences of scientific actions and predictions on the systems they aim to describe or influence. Lastly, the project will provide orientation for the assessment and management of performative science, offering practical guidance for researchers and policymakers.\n\nMAPS will play a crucial role in addressing the current lacuna in philosophical guidance on performative science. By fostering a deeper understanding of performativity and its ethical implications, the project will not only enrich the philosophy of science but also inform the practice of science, contributing to more responsible and effective scientific endeavors. This project promises to make significant strides in managing performativity, a challenge that is increasingly relevant in our data-driven world."
