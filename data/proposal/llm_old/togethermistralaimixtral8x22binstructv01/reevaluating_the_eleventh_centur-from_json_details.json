        " This grant proposal, titled \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aims to revolutionize the way digital data about historical phenomena are created, curated, and utilized by historians. Our primary focus is on the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), with a geographical emphasis on the eastern half of Christendom and the newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe.\n\nThe project's novelty lies in its acknowledgment of the complexity of pre-modern history, where few facts are undisputed. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework that re-frames historical data as assertions linked to an authority, allowing for data manipulation based on source and authority. This framework enables the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict, thereby fostering a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of history.\n\nOur methodology will draw from a range of research disciplines, including prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology. This multidisciplinary approach will enable us to examine trans-regional trends obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom.\n\nA significant challenge we aim to tackle is the potential waste of existing online data. We will devise strategies for contextualization and reuse of this data, ensuring its efficient utilization in our research. Ultimately, our goal is to view history from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of the past.\n\nThis project promises to make substantial contributions to the field of medieval history, offering new ways of creating and curating digital data that can be applied to other historical periods and contexts."
