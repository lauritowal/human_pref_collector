        " The proposed project, \"Transnational histories of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\" (TransCorr), aims to construct a comprehensive history of the concept of 'corruption' in the context of Central-South-East Europe during the period of 1750-1850. The project will explore themes such as political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, drawing upon assessments from both foreign observers and indigenous critics. Motivations investigated will include political, professional, and personal factors, with claims centering around the pursuit of more honest and efficient administrations, effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations.\n\nTransCorr will also examine the linkages between corruption and cultural backwardness, as well as economic under-development. The project goals include demonstrating the reframing of customs as corrupt, examining the impacts of Great Power interventions, and tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes surrounding corruption.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, TransCorr seeks to contribute to the dialogue with global modernization, align historiography with scientific innovations, reframe debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigure the understanding of center-periphery relations. The project will construct a detailed history of the idea of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe, contextualized within the rise of modernity. Ultimately, TransCorr aims to provide valuable insights into the historical development of corruption, its impacts, and the evolution of perceptions surrounding it."
