        " The proposed research project, \"Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges\" (REPAIR), aims to comparatively analyze the establishment, implementation, and reception of reparations payments in addressing global development challenges. These challenges include infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. The project seeks to understand the economic, moral, and political dimensions of reparations, as well as identify the type of wealth transfer they constitute and their implications for the \"reparative aspects\" of economic life.\n\nREPAIR is a novel, comparative social-science study on reparations in the field of development, broadening the scope of existing research. Leveraging innovative theories and methods from economic anthropology, the project will investigate reparations as a form of wealth transfer, focusing on their restorative impact on economic activity. This groundbreaking approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of reparations and their role in global development.\n\nBy examining a diverse range of reparations contexts, REPAIR will foster knowledge exchange and promote better-informed decision-making in reparations processes. The project's findings can potentially guide policymakers and stakeholders in designing and implementing effective reparations strategies, ultimately contributing to more equitable and sustainable global development."
