        " This grant proposal, titled \"Lordship and the Rise of States in Western Europe, 1300-1600,\" aims to explore the complex process of state formation in Western Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries. This project challenges conventional interpretations of state formation, focusing on the decentralization of legal authority and questioning the assumption of centralization. To test this hypothesis, the research employs an analytical framework of path-dependency and examines five case studies in Flanders, Guelders, Normandy, Languedoc, and Warwickshire. The proposal also investigates the role of urbanization, socio-economic organization of rural society, and ideological dissent as variables influencing state formation.\n\nAdditionally, this research addresses the ongoing debate regarding top-down state formation by princes and bottom-up representation, as well as the presence of 'states within states' and the support of elites in the process. The project aims to improve our understanding of the social history of power and its impact on state formation. To achieve these objectives, the proposal incorporates methodological innovations and integrates the findings with existing research on Central and Eastern Europe. By doing so, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the role of lordship in the rise of states in Western Europe during this critical period."
