        " This proposal, titled \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance,\" aims to deliver a comprehensive and world-historically significant understanding of China's urban governance model. The project will tackle theoretical and policy challenges through a multi-scalar investigation of neighbourhoods, cities, and regions. Utilizing ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers, the research will provide a grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China.\n\nCase studies will encompass diverse urban landscapes, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. These case studies will span coastal, central, and western regions, ensuring a holistic perspective of China's urban governance. Strategic projects, such as recent national initiatives, will be examined in the context of the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and trade tensions, underscoring the timeliness of this research.\n\nThe project's contributions extend to both theory and perspective. It will advance the theory of entrepreneurial urban governance and offer an indigenous perspective on the Chinese urban transformation. The outputs of this research will include six workshops and a publication series, disseminating the findings to a broad audience. Ultimately, this project will transform our understanding of China and its governance, providing a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of China's state entrepreneurialism."
