        " This proposal, titled \"Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire: A bio-archaeological project on resilience and collapse in early Christian development of the Negev Desert,\" seeks to employ an innovative, integrative, and data-intensive approach to understand the long-term sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments. Focusing on the 4th-7th century AD in the Negev Desert's Byzantine early Christian urban centers, the project aims to explore contexts of collapse and resilience in an ancient society marked by socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity.\n\nThe research questions encompass social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation due to climatic or anthropogenic causes, and the question of plague. To address these questions, the project will utilize diverse research methods, including archaeology of households, landscapes, and garbage; biomolecular analysis; botanical, zoological, and geological studies; chronometric techniques; artifact analysis; and contextual data analysis.\n\nThe project's relevance lies in its potential to inform strategies for dealing with societal vulnerability in marginal regions, an increasingly pressing issue in a world where development expands such problems to global levels. Despite the risks posed by the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, the project promises critical re-evaluation of current knowledge based on new data and more nuanced, informed generalizations regarding the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development."
