        " Title: Mapping the Impact of Gut Microbiota on Brain and Behaviour through the Lens of GABA\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to elucidate the biochemically informed impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters, specifically GABA, on brain function and behaviour. With humans sharing 99% genetic identicality and only 1% genetic difference impact, our focus lies in the distinctness of gut bacteria, which can vary from 40 to 90 percent. The bacteria to human cell ratio is 1:1, while the bacteria to human DNA ratio is 10:1, emphasizing the potential influence of gut microbiota on human health.\n\nOur research goal is to understand the impact of gut bacteria and probiotics on brain GABA levels and function. We will employ a combination of direct and proxy measure assay methods to investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults, using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for brain GABA measurement. Additionally, we will test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behaviour over a four-week intervention with a custom-made probiotic.\n\nThis multidisciplinary project, spanning psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, will contribute to the research frontier of individual differences in human behaviour and brain function. By addressing the knowledge gap regarding the impact of gut-produced neurotransmitters on the brain and behaviour, we aim to provide valuable insights into the potential of probiotics for improving mental health and well-being."
