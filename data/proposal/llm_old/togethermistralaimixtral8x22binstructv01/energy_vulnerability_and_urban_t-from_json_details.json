        " The proposed project, \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe,\" aims to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty affecting millions of households across Eastern and Central Europe. The causes of energy vulnerability in these regions are multifaceted, including energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, decaying infrastructure, income differentials, and economic and political restructuring. Current conceptualizations of energy poverty are limited in scope, primarily focusing on incomes and energy efficiency.\n\nThis comparative study will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the complex issue of energy poverty in four distinct city contexts: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. By utilizing the energy vulnerability framework, the project seeks to transform the understanding of energy poverty and its implications.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research are threefold: firstly, to improve technical and institutional frameworks for addressing energy poverty; secondly, to facilitate the provision of affordable energy services; and thirdly, to contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. By addressing the energy vulnerability of millions of households and the systemic issues that perpetuate it, this project has the potential to significantly impact the lives of those affected and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable energy landscape in Europe."
