        " India, as the world's largest democracy and a Rising Power, presents a significant case study for understanding global political theory. However, the conceptual foundations of India's political life remain largely unexplored. This project, \"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars,\" aims to fill this knowledge gap by examining the ideas guiding ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement through ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of India's political life. Collaborating with anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics, this project seeks to lay empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life, develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, and explore implications for global political theory with European political ideas scholars. Drawing inspiration from Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, this project promises to deliver substantial impacts on the study of subcontinental politics, methodological insights beyond Europe, and analytical advances towards global political theory. By examining India's demotic political ideas through vernacular languages, this project will contribute to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of global politics."
