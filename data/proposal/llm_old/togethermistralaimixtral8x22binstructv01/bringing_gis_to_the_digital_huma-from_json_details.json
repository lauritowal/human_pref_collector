        " This grant proposal titled \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\" seeks to integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Corpus Linguistics methodologies to develop innovative approaches for analyzing unstructured texts within a spatial context. The principal investigator brings extensive experience in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS). The project aims to create methodologies for interpreting textual sources within a GIS environment, broadening our understanding of the humanities. The research will focus on two primary studies: the English Lake District across different periods, and mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales, considering socio-economic changes and political interventions. The project will involve disciplines such as HGIS, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History. It will have wide-ranging applications, including the analysis of ancient manuscripts, modern newspapers, and e-resources. The project's outreach activities will include short courses, expert meetings, and a conference, aiming to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange. The anticipated impact is significant, with the potential to transform research practices within the humanities and beyond.\n\nWord count: 188"
