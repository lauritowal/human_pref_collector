        " This grant proposal, entitled \"Information services: competition and externalities,\" aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the economics of information services, with a particular focus on strategic interactions, production, and exchange. Emphasizing the critical role of externalities in this field, the proposal examines one-sided or two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and the complementary relationship between information services and physical infrastructures.\n\nThe project is divided into four distinct parts: (1) Background theory, covering two-sided markets, network dynamics, and contractual externalities; (2) Virtual layer, exploring recommendation systems, privacy, and transaction costs through empirical investigation using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms; (3) Physical layer, examining pricing, investment, net-neutrality, and data pricing; and (4) Competition policy, focusing on two-sided markets.\n\nOur approach combines the development of relevant theory, empirical investigation, original dynamic investment models, and tools for competition policy makers. This multifaceted strategy will enable us to conduct a thorough exploration of the role of externalities in the economics of information services, ultimately contributing to a more informed and nuanced understanding of this complex and rapidly evolving field."
