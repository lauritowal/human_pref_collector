        " This grant proposal, titled \"Long-Term Investment,\" aims to investigate the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three interconnected components. The study will explore the transition of firms from capital-intensive, cost-efficient competitors in the 20th century to entities that now prioritize product quality and rely on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. Unlike tangible investments like purchasing a factory, intangible investments may take years to yield results, complicating managerial decisions due to pressure to maximize short-term earnings.\n\nThe first component, Financial Markets, challenges the traditional view that financial markets discourage investment due to short-term shareholder focus. Instead, this study will focus on information incorporation into stock prices and its implications for future investment opportunities, aiming to determine the efficiency of information channels.\n\nThe second component, Incentives, will delve into the level of pay and its sensitivity to performance, with a key focus on the horizon of incentives. Research will target areas such as the optimal incentive horizon, its effect on long-term decisions, and the potential for incentivizing teachers beyond teaching-to-the-test.\n\nThe final component, Effects of Investment, addresses the challenge of demonstrating benefits from long-term investments. The study will concentrate on corporate social responsibility data, aiming to establish a link between such investments and firm value. This comprehensive study seeks to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of long-term investment in the contemporary business landscape."
