        " This interdisciplinary project, titled \"From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,\" seeks to examine the institutionalization of combat trauma within the military and psychiatric institutions of Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Utilizing a blend of anthropological, biopolitical, and medicalization perspectives, this research aims to develop a comparative framework for understanding the shaping of combat trauma within these nations.\n\nThe methodology will encompass ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis. Key objectives include shedding light on the conflicting values and perceptions of ethnicity within these institutions, and understanding the resistance to clinical illness models among veterans. The project targets veterans and clinicians, with significant implications for both policy and healthcare.\n\nExpected outcomes include identifying key problems in veteran care, advancing studies in biopolitics and medicalization, and understanding the internalization of war-related suffering. By examining the role of the military and psychiatry in the institutionalization of combat trauma, this research will contribute to the broader understanding of how societies manage and respond to the impact of warfare on their citizens. Ultimately, this project aims to inform and impact policy and healthcare practices, ensuring more comprehensive and culturally sensitive care for veterans."
