        " Title: The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism\n\nThis research proposal aims to conduct an empirical test on the influence of personal experiences, information environments, and aggregate economic shocks on political decisions, specifically focusing on the rise of populism and extremism. The project will be divided into three distinct parts.\n\nFirstly, we will investigate the impact of personal employment histories and the information environment on voting for Trump, utilizing a vast database of over 40 million resumes from 2010-2016 and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. This research component will provide insights into the role of economic factors in shaping political preferences.\n\nSecondly, we will examine the influence of negative social experiences, such as corporal punishment in UK schools during the 1970-80s, on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas. We will utilize archival records and data on contemporary educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting to understand the long-term effects of adverse experiences on political attitudes.\n\nLastly, we will explore the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes by analyzing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda in WWII Germany. This component will shed light on the conditions that motivate individuals to resist oppressive regimes.\n\nOverall, this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of economic shocks in the rise of populism and the heterogeneity of responses to such shocks. By examining these factors, we aim to contribute to the broader discourse on political decision-making and the dynamics of populism and extremism."
