        " This proposal, titled \"Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe,\" seeks to investigate the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The project aims to provide new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, employing an interdisciplinary approach linking causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models. Furthermore, it will incorporate subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates, offering a comprehensive perspective on the issue.\n\nThe proposal addresses the increasing demand for environmental quality and the global climate change crisis, prioritizing the improvement of environmental quality as a key concern for policymakers. The main origins of regulated pollution, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, will be examined to identify potential areas for intervention.\n\nThe key objective of this project is to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management. By doing so, it is expected to have a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the negative effects of pollution emissions and improve overall environmental quality in post-industrial Europe."
