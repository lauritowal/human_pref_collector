        " This grant proposal, titled \"The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa,\" aims to investigate the Bantu Expansion during the Late Holocene period in Central Africa. The project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, involving archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics, to understand the first Bantu-speaking village communities. The proposal addresses several controversial topics with potential political repercussions, as it seeks to uncover the timing, location, and archaeological signature of the earliest Bantu-speaking villagers and their interaction with hunter-gatherers.\n\nThe research will focus on subsistence, diet, and habitat, utilizing lexical reconstruction to reconstruct subsistence practices and land use. Fieldwork will be conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola. Additional data, including archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic information, will be integrated to provide a holistic view of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming.\n\nThe project will employ phylogenetic modelling and foster interuniversity collaboration to address open questions surrounding the Bantu Expansion. The proposal's ultimate goal is to contribute to our understanding of this significant event in human history, which affected Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa and dates back approximately 5,000 years. This research will not only shed light on the past but also inform our understanding of present-day communities and their environments."
