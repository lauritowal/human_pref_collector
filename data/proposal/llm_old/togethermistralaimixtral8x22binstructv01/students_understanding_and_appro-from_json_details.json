        " The proposed project, \"Students’ understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship education\" (STUDACT), aims to transform education systems, empower learners, and foster mutual understanding between diverse populations to build peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies. Aligned with UN SDG targets for 2030, STUDACT focuses on Global Citizenship Education (GCE) and hypothesizes that students engage with GCE based on personal traits or context.\n\nDespite existing research on the challenges and inconsistencies in developing GCE and capacity building, there is a lack of systematic baseline data on student understanding and appropriation of GCE. To address this gap, STUDACT will explore student reception, understanding, and appropriation of GCE across six countries: Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK. The project will utilize group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis to collect data and examine policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance.\n\nSTUDACT will investigate the following research questions: How do students of different backgrounds understand GCE? How do students appropriate GCE? How do understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems? How are student attitudes aligned with those inferred by international organizations, teacher training programs, curricula developers, or teachers?\n\nBy treating students as core partners and agentic participants, STUDACT seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of student perspectives on GCE. This project will contribute to the development of informed policies and practices that support the successful implementation of GCE in diverse educational contexts."
