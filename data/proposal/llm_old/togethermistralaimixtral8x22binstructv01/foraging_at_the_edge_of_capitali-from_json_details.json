        " In response to the post-2008 financial crisis and the ongoing climate crisis, our international research team at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, proposes \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism,\" a comprehensive project aimed at developing a political ecology of foraging in the Anthropocene. As foraging activities have increased globally, we observe a growing relevance of this economic strategy, exemplified by practices such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and the presence of Amazon nomads in the US. However, mainstream attention to these practices remains patchy.\n\nOur interdisciplinary research, grounded in anthropology, will explore foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy. With a focus on the post-2008 financial crisis context, we will investigate the ways in which foraging activities intersect with issues of climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Our team of five researchers will produce a series of planned outputs, including two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, 12 peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition, to share our findings with both academic and non-academic audiences.\n\nThrough this project, we aim to contribute to broader discussions on the role of foraging in contemporary society and its potential as an adaptive strategy in the face of economic and environmental challenges. Our research will provide valuable insights for policymakers, environmentalists, and communities engaged in foraging activities, ultimately fostering a more nuanced understanding of the diverse and complex ways in which humans interact with their environments in the Anthropocene."
