        " This research proposal, titled \"Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010,\" aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies and develop explanations for patterns of change in policy fields. The study will focus on the change in morality policy over time, comparison across countries, and comparison across policy subfields, including life and death (abortion, euthanasia), sexuality (prostitution, pornography, homosexuality), and addictive substances and behavior. The research will cover a period from 1980 to 2010, focusing on 25 member countries of the OECD.\n\nThe proposed methodology consists of a macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies, utilizing legislative output data as the primary data source. The case selection for qualitative studies will be based on the results from the quantitative study, identifying critical cases. This research will significantly contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay of international and domestic factors influencing morality policies in diverse societies, informing policymakers, and stimulating further academic inquiry in this critical field."
