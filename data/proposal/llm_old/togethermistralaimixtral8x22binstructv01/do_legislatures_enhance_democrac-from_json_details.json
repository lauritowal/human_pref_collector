        " This grant proposal, titled \"Do Legislatures Enhance Democracy in Africa?\", aims to investigate the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes. The central research question is whether legislatures in authoritarian countries have the potential to enhance democracy. We will explore two theoretical viewpoints: elections and multi-party systems prolong autocracies, and successive multi-party elections increase democracy. This research faces challenges such as the opaque nature of authoritarian regimes and limited research on African cases.\n\nAdopting a mixed methods design, we will analyze both qualitative and quantitative data. Our methodology includes content analysis of parliamentary debates, full population surveys, social network analysis, and process tracing. Areas of investigation include law-making, interaction patterns and political dialogue, and representation and constituency responsiveness. The study will focus on seven countries, collecting parliamentary debates through content analysis and conducting national assembly surveys to gather biographical, opinion, and social interaction data.\n\nOur strong team of partner institutions in the seven African countries will contribute to collecting extensive and systematic empirical evidence on legislative behaviour in electoral autocracies. This research will provide valuable insights into the role of legislatures in African electoral authoritarian regimes and their potential to enhance democracy, addressing the current gap in understanding these complex political systems."
