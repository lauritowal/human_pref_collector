        " This proposal, titled \"Bridging Europe: A Quaternary Timescale For The Expansion And Evolution Of Humans,\" aims to refine our understanding of European human cultural and population dynamics and their relationship to environmental change over the last 2.6 million years. The research will focus on amino acid and thermoluminescence dating methods to overcome the limitations of radiocarbon dating, which is currently restricted to approximately 60,000 years. By employing paired dating methods on calcitic fossils and snail opercula, this project will shed light on critical questions surrounding the timing of early human expansion into Europe, the climatic conditions during human expansion, and differences in tool technologies. The study will span the entire Palaeolithic period across Eurasia, covering regions such as Britain and the Black Sea. The significance of this chronology lies in its potential to illuminate human evolution and migration in Europe, as well as the impact of climatic oscillations, expansion of ice sheets, sea-level changes, and re-organization of plant and animal communities. The pan-European chronology developed by this research will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand our past."
