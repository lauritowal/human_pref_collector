        " This grant proposal, titled \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the Elderly to Places Where Care is More Affordable,\" focuses on the transnationalization of care and the phenomenon of ageing body relocation to affordable care locations. The research aims to explore the marketization of care and its implications on welfare states and entitlements across borders. This multi-sited anthropological study will be conducted in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, targeting patients primarily from Austria and Germany. The cost comparison reveals that care in these locations is approximately one-third of the cost in the home countries.\n\nThe historical context of German and Habsburg-Hungarian history provides a rich backdrop for understanding the current trends in care relocation. The study will cover various aspects such as labour migration, real estate investment, state insurances, and regional migration. The research methods include in-depth ethnographic studies, investigation of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and histories of places.\n\nThe implications of this study are far-reaching, potentially reshaping our understanding of new transnational entanglements of welfare states. The privatization of care landscapes and the question of what it means to become old and in need of care in an intertwined Europe are also significant aspects of this research.\n\nThe findings from this study could contribute to a broader understanding of care relocation as part of future making in Europe. This research could provide valuable insights into the trending terms of 'grandmother deportation' and 'geriatric colonialism,' shedding light on the complex dynamics of care provision in a globalized world."
