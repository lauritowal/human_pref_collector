        " This grant proposal titled \"The role of consciousness in adaptive behavior: A combined empirical, computational and robot-based approach\" aims to uncover the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior. The project, named Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC), aspires to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action, identify neuronal principles of consciousness, and construct a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture. We hypothesize that a shift to an intentional agent-dominated world requires distinct control architectures, such as parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation and a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene. These conscious scenes will enable crucial functions like credit assignment and planning beyond immediate information.\n\nThe proposed multidisciplinary approach will yield a framework that advances beyond the current state of the art, system-level models of conscious architecture, and computational studies of the neuronal substrate. Empirical validation will be conducted with a humanoid robot and stroke patients. Moreover, advanced tools will be developed to facilitate these investigations.\n\nThe significance of this project is manifold. It addresses fundamental questions on the function and genesis of consciousness, advances our understanding of the mind and brain, and provides new neurorehabilitation technologies. Furthermore, it contributes to the development of a new generation of robots with advanced social competence. This project thus offers a unique opportunity to understand the role of consciousness in adaptive behavior within a multidisciplinary context."
