        " This grant proposal, titled \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes,\" aims to elucidate the intricate differences between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. Utilizing behavioral and brain imaging methods, the project comprises three distinct tracks. Track 1 focuses on unconscious perception, employing Gaze-Contingent Substitution for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. The primary objective is to provide evidence for sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences. Track 2 centers on conscious perception, adopting a Bayesian framework to reconstruct perceptual contents. This track aims to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions. Lastly, Track 3 examines the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG. This track seeks to answer questions regarding the development of consciousness through the maturation of posterior or anterior brain regions. The expected impacts of this project include (1) advancing our understanding of subliminal influences, (2) shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual illusions, and (3) providing new insights on the development of consciousness in humans. The successful completion of this project will significantly contribute to the existing body of knowledge in cognitive neuroscience and psychology."
