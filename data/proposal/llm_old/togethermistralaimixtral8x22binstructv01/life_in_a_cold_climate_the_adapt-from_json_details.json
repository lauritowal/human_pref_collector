        " This interdisciplinary project, titled \"Life in a cold climate: the adaptation of cereals to new environments and the establishment of agriculture in Europe,\" aims to elucidate the environmental adaptation of cereals during the spread of agriculture in Europe.\n\nBy employing a combination of population genomics, ecological modeling, ancient DNA sequencing, and computer methods for temporal ordering of adaptations, we will investigate the influence of ecological pressures on barley and wheat crops. Our objectives include identifying loci under selection, associating these loci with ecogeographical variables, and dating the periods of adaptations.\n\nBy synthesizing these findings with existing archaeobotanical and demographic data, we will shed light on the human and environmental dimensions of crop domestication in Europe. This will provide a more balanced perspective, addressing the current imbalance between human and environmental dimensions in domestication studies.\n\nOur outputs will include an archaeobotanical database analysis, allowing us to correlate our findings with demographic data. This will offer valuable insights into Neolithic population dynamics and crop productivity, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the establishment of agriculture in Europe.\n\nThis project represents a significant step in understanding the complex interplay between crops, environment, and human societies during the Neolithic period. By bridging the gap between human and environmental dimensions, we will advance our knowledge of the processes that shaped the agricultural landscape of Europe."
