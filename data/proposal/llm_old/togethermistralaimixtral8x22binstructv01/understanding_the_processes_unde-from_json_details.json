        " In this grant proposal titled \"Understanding the Processes Underlying Societal Threats using Novel Cluster-based Methods,\" we aim to address the pressing need for accurate and reliable methods to understand complex societal constructs and their interrelationships. Social scientists grapple with questions about the connections between values, beliefs, and perceptions related to critical societal threats, such as climate change, politics, and vaccination. However, the lack of direct observability of these constructs, differing processes across diverse groups, and issues of measurement inequivalence or non-invariance pose significant methodological challenges. These challenges often lead to underestimated effects, misguided conclusions, and invalid comparisons among constructs.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we propose the implementation of a mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework. This innovative solution offers clustering techniques to identify subsets of groups with common processes and flexible measurement models to account for non-invariance. By leveraging large-scale survey data, our approach will enable social scientists to better understand the drivers of various constructs, including climate change beliefs, perceived threats, political beliefs, risk perception, susceptibility to misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy.\n\nOur proposed solution will be implemented using freely available software, ensuring widespread accessibility and promoting collaboration among researchers. By addressing the methodological challenges and providing a comprehensive framework for understanding societal threats, this project aims to contribute significantly to the field of social science research."
