        " This grant proposal, titled \"Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience,\" aims to investigate the impact of historical factors on conflict and economic development across various regions, with a particular focus on Latin America. The research is divided into two parts: the first part will examine the role of initial colonization times of Latin America from 1492 to 1599, utilizing administrative data on the first colonizers, including their town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and city of arrival in the Americas. The analysis will employ a within-country approach to explore the interplay between institutions and human capital, economic development, and conflict. The second part of the research will delve into the long-run dynamics of conflict by constructing a dataset using archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts in various regions. This will help understand the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict patterns. By integrating historical data and archaeological evidence, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how past events shape present-day conflict and economic development. The findings of this study will contribute significantly to the existing literature and inform policy-making in regions affected by historical conflicts."
