    "descriptions": [
        " The proposed research project, \"CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\", aims to develop a novel theory to elucidate the underlying reasons for the persistent lack of coordination within growing policy regimes, with a particular focus on climate policy integration in the European Union (EU). This project is driven by the urgent need to address the EU's projected failure to meet its net-zero emissions target by 2050.\n\nOur research will concentrate on the absence of a system-level perspective of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies, inadequate theories, and appropriate study methods. We will employ a multi-faceted methodological approach, combining quantitative modeling of policy interdependencies, network methods, process tracing, interviews, surveys, comparative case studies, and advanced network analysis. Our objectives include revealing patterns of policy (dis)integration, understanding temporal dynamics, identifying system-level solutions, and simulating policy reforms.\n\nWe will conduct a comparative analysis of the EU and selected member states, focusing on their coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. Our expected outcomes include valuable insights and advice to enhance climate policy integration within the EU, with broader implications for advancing the climate policy debate.\n\nThe research team brings expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, ensuring a robust and insightful exploration of this complex issue. This project promises to contribute significantly to our understanding of policy integration processes and provide actionable recommendations for improving climate policy integration in the EU and beyond."
