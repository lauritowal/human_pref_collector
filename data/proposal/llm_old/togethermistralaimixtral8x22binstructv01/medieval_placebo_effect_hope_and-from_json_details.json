        " The proposed research project, \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\" (MedPlaceboEffect), aims to explore the underpinnings of the placebo effect in medieval medicine and healing within Southern Europe during the period of 1100-1500. The project adopts a triangular approach, focusing on ideas, practices, and organizing structures to examine the medieval placebo effect's core concepts: hope, expectation for cure, belief, trust, and the placebo effect itself.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are to identify the forces that shaped the medieval placebo effect, foster a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions, demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities, and showcase the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing. Furthermore, the project seeks to examine the health system's legacy and its negotiation in the 21st century.\n\nThe successful completion of this project will provide valuable insights into the therapy elements in medieval healing, the impact of the soul/mind on health, and a foundation for contemporary examination of healing practices. By understanding the historical context of the placebo effect, we can address challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research. In essence, the MedPlaceboEffect project will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the placebo effect's role in healthcare, both in the past and the present."
