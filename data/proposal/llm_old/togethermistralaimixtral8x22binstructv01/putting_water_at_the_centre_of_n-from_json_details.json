        " The proposed project, \"NUCLEARWATERS: Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History,\" aims to reevaluate the history of nuclear energy through a novel, water-centric perspective. This innovative approach positions nuclear energy as a hydraulic technology, thereby shedding light on its historical context rooted in centuries of hydraulic engineering and hydraulic civilizations.\n\nThe project will delve into the examination of historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions, hypothesizing that a water-centred history will resolve key enigmas in nuclear energy history. The investigation will work across six thematic work packages, including the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nThe ambition of this project is to revise the narrative surrounding nuclear energy history, with far-reaching implications for the field of history of technology, environmental history, and the broader public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. By uncovering the intricate relationship between nuclear energy and water, this project seeks to provide a holistic understanding of nuclear energy that transcends conventional interpretations.\n\nThrough its innovative approach, comprehensive investigation, and wide-ranging implications, \"NUCLEARWATERS\" promises to significantly contribute to the discourse on nuclear energy, offering new insights into its historical development and its interplay with water as a vital resource."
