        " MERLIT: A Transcultural Literary History of Meritocracy\n\nMERLIT, an innovative research project, aims to provide the first systematic, diachronic, and comparative investigation of meritocratic narratives in literature. With a global perspective, this project transcends the narrow focus on Western contexts and recent developments, offering a comprehensive literary history of meritocratic thought. By examining the enmeshment of meritocracy with structures of domination and privilege, MERLIT will advance our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing and highlight literature's worldmaking role.\n\nThis interdisciplinary study integrates literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation to explore practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques. The project expands its contextual focus to the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts, engaging with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present.\n\nMERLIT's six work packages will address critical gaps in current research, such as the lack of investigations into formal principles and the narrow focus on Western contexts. By bridging these gaps, MERLIT will contribute significantly to the fields of literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation.\n\nIn conclusion, MERLIT offers an unprecedented opportunity to delve into the complex relationship between meritocracy and literature, providing valuable insights into the role of writing in shaping societal structures and dynamics. This project's global relevance and interdisciplinary approach make it an ideal candidate for grant funding."
