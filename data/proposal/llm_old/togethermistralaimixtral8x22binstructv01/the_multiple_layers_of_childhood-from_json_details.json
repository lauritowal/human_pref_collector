        " The proposed initiative, \"The Multiple LAYERS of Childhood Aversity,\" aims to establish a unified data infrastructure for life course analyses of childhood adversity in 2 million individuals across three generations. This interdisciplinary project will utilize methods from data science, epidemiology, econometrics, and systems science within a complex systems framework. The project recognizes the long-lasting, multi-form nature of adversity and its intersecting layers, including biological, health, social, neighborhood, and environmental aspects. While current literature primarily focuses on social adversity, this project seeks to redirect attention towards the multiple layers of adversity. By integrating real-world policy data and simulations into a nationwide context, the project aims to understand patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of change. Ultimately, the project aims to identify targets for support, benefiting both children and families. The transgenerational establishment of health inequalities in childhood underscores the urgency of this research, which promises to inform policies and interventions that mitigate the impact of adversity and promote resilience across generations."
