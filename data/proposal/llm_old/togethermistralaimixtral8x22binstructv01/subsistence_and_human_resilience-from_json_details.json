        " This grant proposal, entitled \"Subsistence and human resilience to sudden climatic events in Europe during MIS3,\" aims to investigate the impact of climate change on the extinction of Neanderthals and the subsequent colonization by Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. Focusing on key locations in Southern European peninsulas, the project will examine 20 sites using a combination of zooarchaeological, taphonomic, and stable isotope analyses. The primary objectives of this research are to assess the behavioral flexibility and resilience of both Neanderthals and AMH, reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions, and develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity. By studying these species and their subsistence strategies in response to climatic changes, we hope to gain a better understanding of the subsistence patterns that favored AMH and the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction. This research is of significant relevance as it contributes to prehistory studies on a pan-European scale, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between climate, environment, and human evolution during this critical period."
