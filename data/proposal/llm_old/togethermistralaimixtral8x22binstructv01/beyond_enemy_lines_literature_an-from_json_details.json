        " This grant proposal, titled \"Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949,\" aims to conduct the first comprehensive survey of the cultural landscape in the British and American zones of post-WWII Germany. The project's objectives include investigating the cross-fertilization of Anglo/American and German literature and film, providing a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, and contributing to the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany. By combining literature and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing, this multidisciplinary study aspires to open up a major new field of research. Ultimately, the project will explore the relationship between postwar culture and the Cold War within the geographical focus of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany from 1945 to 1949."
