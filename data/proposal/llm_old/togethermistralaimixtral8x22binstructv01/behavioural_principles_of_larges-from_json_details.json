        " The grant proposal titled \"Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation\" ({\"proposal_name\"}) aims to address pressing global issues such as global warming and the Covid19 pandemic by fostering collective action and cooperation. The project, named PRINCIPLES, recognizes the limitations of current models that focus on isolated aspects of cooperation. Instead, it proposes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to develop a unified science of human cooperation.\n\nThe key concept underpinning this project is \"rule following,\" which will be explored through a series of objectives, including but not limited to: the development of a comprehensive model of cooperation, the experimental testing of its behavioural principles, the investigation of behavioural links between these principles, the analysis of models of social dilemmas, and the explanation of behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems.\n\nThe research approach is innovative and robust, involving the combination of insights and methods from different social sciences, the creation of a novel experimentally tested framework, and the implementation of incentivised experiments in representative samples.\n\nThe primary target problem is climate care, and the target audience includes researchers and policy makers. Through PRINCIPLES, these stakeholders will be equipped with behavioural principles, tools, and data to tackle cooperation problems using an interdisciplinary and experimentally tested framework. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide a more holistic and effective understanding of large-scale cooperation, thereby contributing to the resolution of significant global challenges."
