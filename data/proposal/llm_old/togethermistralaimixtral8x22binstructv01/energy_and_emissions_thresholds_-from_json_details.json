        " This grant proposal aims to address the critical question of defining and achieving decent living standards for all, while balancing energy needs and mitigating climate change impacts. Titled \"Energy and Emissions Thresholds for Providing Decent Living Standards to All,\" the project seeks to quantify the energy requirements and climate-related emissions associated with providing decent living standards across different countries. The research will operationalize basic needs views of human development and discern the characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. It will also quantify energy needs and emissions for decent living constituents, considering the influence of culture, climate, technology, and other conditions in five emerging economies. Through lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modelling, the project will analyze path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity. The objectives include developing knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyzing climate change impacts of energy use for these standards, identifying low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and helping quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. This research will provide valuable insights into the energy and emissions thresholds necessary for achieving decent living standards, thereby informing policy and decision-making in this crucial area."
