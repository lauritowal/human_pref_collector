        " The proposed research project, \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan\" (PIVOTAL), employs the predictive coding research framework to investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of predictive processing in relation to memory across the human lifespan. The project will explore core concepts such as the 'prediction machine,' 'internal models,' and 'future state predictions.' Key empirical questions include understanding the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, as well as the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation and senescence.\n\nPIVOTAL aims to advance understanding of neurocognitive architectures and examine the role of predictive processing in human memory systems. The research methods involve integrating predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs.\n\nStudy populations will include children, younger adults, and older adults, with a focus on episodic and semantic memory types. The project will examine both progression and conservation developmental orientations, considering neurocognitive factors such as the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits.\n\nThe potential impact of PIVOTAL is significant, as it aims to establish a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle and enhance our understanding of the emergence of disorders in different life stages. By elucidating the nature and influence of internal models on predictions and how they vary across the lifespan, PIVOTAL will contribute to the broader scientific understanding of memory systems and their implications for human cognition."
