        " This grant proposal, titled \"Inequality in 3D – measurement and implications for macroeconomic theory,\" aims to deepen our understanding of economic inequality and its macroeconomic implications. By leveraging novel microdata, our primary objective is to measure the economy down to the single household along three dimensions: consumption, income, and wealth. This approach will enable us to quantify the micro heterogeneity that significantly impacts macroeconomic theory.\n\nOur methodology incorporates heterogeneous agent models, which we will contrast with traditional representative agent models. This comparison will allow us to discern the strengths and weaknesses of each model in addressing inequality, informing the development of current and future macroeconomic models. Our research will involve disciplined empirical efforts, guided by recent modeling developments to ensure rigor and relevance.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project are manifold. Firstly, we aim to provide novel insights for improvements in fiscal and monetary policy tools. Secondly, we seek to inform the debate on economic inequality, offering valuable perspectives to policymakers and stakeholders. Lastly, our findings will serve as lessons to policymakers regarding economic inequality, ultimately contributing to more equitable economic policies and practices. Overall, this study of the interactions between inequality and the macroeconomy promises to yield significant insights and implications for macroeconomic theory and policy."
