        " The proposed research project, \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea,\" aims to investigate the dynamic shifts in fishing practices and transoceanic expansion, with a particular focus on the movements of fishers across China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. This study challenges the conventional assumption of fishers as mere instruments of state agendas and employs a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating concepts such as radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and relational and shifting multiple mobilities.\n\nOur research will categorize fishers into four distinct groups: fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers. The methodology will encompass a theoretical framework, a methodological framework, and fine-grained ethnography. We will specifically examine the behaviors and practices of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, with a particular emphasis on shore-based activities.\n\nThe project's significance lies in its potential to contribute to both scientific and policy-making spheres. It will elucidate the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood and the role of various fisher categories in meeting this demand. The project will develop a novel theoretical and methodological framework, conceptualizing fishers as mobile maritime actors. This research will provide critical insights into the complexities of transoceanic fishing practices, informing more effective and sustainable fisheries management policies."
