        " The proposed research project, \"Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family,\" seeks to investigate the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time through comparative phylogenetic modeling. This highly multidisciplinary project comprises three key components: VARIKIN-Evolution, VARIKIN-Usage, and VARIKIN-Development. VARIKIN-Evolution focuses on kinship terminologies and family norms change, employing comparative phylogenetic modeling to analyze eight language families. VARIKIN-Usage explores the usage of kinship language in spoken and written forms, utilizing methodologies such as corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews. VARIKIN-Development examines children's acquisition and understanding of kinship in small-scale, non-Western communities through participant observation and elicitation tasks. The project's objectives include analyzing patterns of kinship change, examining the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, linking individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterizing cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. By integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time."
