        " This grant proposal, entitled \"Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45,\" aims to investigate the role and impact of military justice during the Asia-Pacific War, as wielded by Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, and civilian participants. The research will focus on the East Asian and Southeast Asian regions from 1937 to 1945, examining the purposes, outcomes, and implications of military justice in this context.\n\nThe project will employ a multi-layered approach, combining analysis of legal practice with an examination of the routinisation and escalation of violence within the military justice system. Original archival work will serve as the primary source material, providing a unique perspective on this critical period in modern Japanese history and international law.\n\nThe study will explore how military justice was employed to regulate violence for war goals, deter and coerce civilian populations, and legitimize Japan's involvement in the conflict. The consequences of these actions, including execution and harsh imprisonment, will be analyzed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the military justice system's impact on the region and its inhabitants.\n\nBy examining the historical context of military justice during the Asia-Pacific War, this research will yield valuable insights into contemporary humanitarian issues. These findings will contribute to the fields of modern Japanese history and international law, offering a fresh perspective on the complex interplay between justice, violence, and legitimacy during wartime. Ultimately, this project aims to foster a deeper understanding of the historical precedents that shape our present-day approaches to conflict resolution and human rights."
