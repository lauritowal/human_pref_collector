        " The proposed project, titled \"Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training,\" aims to investigate the impact of acute stress on large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition, and to develop interventions for enhancing stress resilience. The primary hypothesis is that acute stress induces dynamic shifts in resource allocation at large-scale networks. The objectives include characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during acute stress and recovery, identifying neural markers predicting resilience to stress using biosensors and mobile applications, cross-validating these markers in a high stress sensitivity patient group, examining the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts, testing the disruption of cognitive functions by shifting network balance, and developing functional MRI neurofeedback for training adaptive reallocation of neural resources. The project will employ network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback approaches. The anticipated outcomes of this project include insights into brain adaptation to acute stress, transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience vs sensitivity, and a method for training stress resilience. This research could potentially contribute to a novel framework for understanding alterations in neural systems due to acute stress as shifts in network balance."
