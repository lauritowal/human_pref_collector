        " This proposal, titled \"Reward Revisited: Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Motivational Influences on Human Cognition,\" aims to construct a groundbreaking, integrative conceptual and neural framework for understanding the impact of reward on human cognition. The project will explore the intricate relationship between motivation and cognitive operations, focusing on conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. By incorporating aspects such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the impact of irrelevant information, we seek to extend the current understanding of reward effects.\n\nThe proposal is particularly relevant to conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, as it investigates disturbances in dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems associated with these neurological and psychiatric disorders. Through the use of optimized neuroimaging methods, we will delve into the neural activity underlying these processes.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to provide valuable insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. It addresses the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals and explores its distortions in various disorders. Ultimately, this project aspires to contribute to the development of more effective interventions and therapies for individuals suffering from these conditions."
