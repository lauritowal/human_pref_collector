        " This grant proposal, titled \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators,\" aims to secure ERC Proof of Concept funding to develop a software toolbox for predicting and monitoring crucial economic indicators. Building upon our previous ERC-2007-StG grant, \"Change-Point Tests,\" this project seeks to advance the field by incorporating real-time monitoring, predictive breakdown tests, and a novel model family that utilizes high-frequency information.\n\nOur primary objective is to enhance economic forecasts and decision-making processes for governments, central banks, and firms. The software will be user-friendly, featuring a three-dimensional graphical representation and ensuring accessibility to decision-makers. The project's impact is expected to be significant, contributing to prudent economic policy, economic growth, and overall economic and social welfare.\n\nWe have already established contact with a forecasting agency and a central bank for potential collaborations. These partnerships will provide valuable input and validation for our software, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, this project aims to revolutionize economic forecasting by developing novel models and tests that surpass current state-of-the-art methods. The resulting software toolbox will empower its users to make informed decisions that drive economic prosperity and social welfare."
