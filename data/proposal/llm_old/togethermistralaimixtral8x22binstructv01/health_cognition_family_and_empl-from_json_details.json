        " The proposed research project, titled \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" aims to investigate the impact of men's evolving family and working lives on their health and cognition. This study is of significant importance as men experience a higher premature mortality rate and preventable excess mortality, with a notable gender health disparity. The primary objective is to improve men's health and cognition, contributing to gender equality goals.\n\nThis project aligns with the broader societal contributions of increasing men's family roles, enhancing their participation in the labor market, and extending their potential societal contributions. The research will focus on the life stages of young adulthood and midlife, examining cohort and period differences, the work-face interface, the male breadwinner model, and fathers' participation in childcare. The methodology will involve disentangling selection and causality.\n\nThe project will leverage comprehensive data from the Norwegian population, including register data, survey data, and genetic data. Health measures will encompass self-reported, clinical, and register data, while employment data will cover work participation and occupation. The study will examine cognitive trajectories with a sample size of over 12,000 men, aged from their late teens to 36-69.\n\nThe study will also consider the trends in family and working lives, such as the tertiary education gap where men lag behind women, increased female labor participation, slightly decreased male labor participation, and the increased risk of job loss for men due to technological change. Additionally, it will address the dramatically risen rate of male childlessness, with 1 out of 4 or 3 childless at age 40 in Western countries, and the increased participation of fathers in childcare, despite the partial loss of the male breadwinner role.\n\nThis research project is currently pending funding."
