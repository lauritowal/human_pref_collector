        " This proposal, entitled \"Fluidity in the Medieval Aristotle: Readers and Readings of the Greek-Latin Translations,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive investigation into novel ways of understanding the Latin Aristotle during the late medieval and early modern periods. Our primary focus is on the textual variance found in handwritten books preserving translations from the 12th and 13th centuries. This research will impact the fields of philosophy, science, and theology by examining hundreds of manuscripts containing Latin translations of Aristotle's critical treatises, such as De anima, De generatione et corruptione, and De caelo.\n\nOur research methodology involves documenting variant readings in manuscript witnesses, which will shed light on the textual fluidity present in these manuscripts. This fluidity offers valuable insights into how readers during this era were exposed to newly available translations that fundamentally differed from their Greek originals. By studying these variations, we hope to develop an innovative model of interpretation for medieval translations of philosophy and science.\n\nThis project is of significant importance as it will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the intellectual landscape of the late medieval and early modern periods. Moreover, our innovative approach to interpreting medieval translations of philosophy and science has the potential to reshape scholarly discourse on the subject.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal seeks funding to support a groundbreaking study of textual fluidity in medieval Latin translations of Aristotle's works. The results of this research will not only deepen our understanding of the period but also introduce a new methodological framework for interpreting medieval translations of philosophical and scientific texts."
