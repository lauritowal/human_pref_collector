        " This grant proposal, titled \"How nature affects cooperation in common pool resource systems,\" aims to investigate how natural systems influence the preferences and incentives of economic agents, ultimately shaping the management of common-pool resources. Our research will focus on three key mechanisms: (A) the role of tipping points and thresholds in the natural system as potential catalysts for cooperation; (B) the impact of resource abundance volatility on risk preferences and community-based management; and (C) the interaction between leadership and the natural environment in fostering cooperation and overcoming common-pool dilemmas.\n\nOur study will adopt theoretical and statistical approaches, spanning three continents to ensure a comprehensive and diverse analysis. By integrating perspectives from economics and sustainability science, we aim to identify the circumstances where natural preconditions and social settings promote sustainable use of renewable resources.\n\nThe proposed project aligns with the growing recognition of the interconnectedness between human societies and the natural world. Our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of how nature influences human behavior and decision-making, particularly in the context of managing shared resources. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective policies and strategies that foster cooperation and sustainability, thereby promoting the long-term well-being of both human societies and the natural environment."
