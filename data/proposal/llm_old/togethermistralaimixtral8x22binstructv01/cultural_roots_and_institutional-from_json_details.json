        " The proposed project, \"Cultural roots and institutional transformations of teachers’ careers and the teaching profession in Europe,\" aims to systematically compare and analyze the educational systems of Belgium, France, and England, with a particular focus on the low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages that plague the education sector. The project's objectives are fourfold: to explain the nature of teacher policies, understand changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze the allocation of teachers, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration. Utilizing a post-comparative mixed-method design, the project will consist of four work packages: teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. The methodology will encompass policy analysis, secondary data analyses, a qualitative study, multilevel multi-group analyses, and semi-structured interviews. Data sources will include both national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility. The project will target non-entrants and early leavers to generate new theoretical knowledge and reconceptualize institutional change. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide valuable insights into the institutional dimensions affecting teachers' careers and the profession in Europe, with the potential to inform policy and practice in the education sector."
