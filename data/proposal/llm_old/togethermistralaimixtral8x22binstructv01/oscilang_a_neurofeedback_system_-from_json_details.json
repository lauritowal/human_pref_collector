    "descriptions": [
        " The OsciLang project aims to develop an affordable, wearable neurofeedback system that leverages brain-computer interface technology for diagnosing and treating language and reading impairments, such as dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). The proposed system will synchronize brain activity with changes in speech signals to diagnose and improve these conditions by enhancing brain-speech tracking capabilities. This innovative approach is based on the reduced auditory tracking observed in the delta band in dyslexic readers, and utilizes neurofeedback mechanisms that rely on the phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech.\n\nOsciLang will provide an interface that quantifies basic brain activity parameters in real-time via EEG, enabling users to monitor phase coherence at theta and delta bands, and facilitating top-down control on specific activation patterns. The system will be particularly beneficial in noisy environments, where language and reading impairments can be exacerbated. The expected outcome is improved literacy skills in dyslexics, with potential extensions to provide a framework and technology for enhancing reading abilities.\n\nBy addressing these disorders with an affordable and lightweight solution, the OsciLang project aims to improve the quality of life for individuals with language and reading impairments, while also offering a potential extension for enhancing reading abilities in the broader population."
