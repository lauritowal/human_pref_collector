        " Title: Beyond the breadline: Charitable food provision and survival strategies of the urban poor in a comparative perspective\n\nThis project aims to investigate and compare the historical trajectory and current dynamics of charitable food provision (CFP) in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. By examining CFP in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, we will explore the interdependence between food insecurity and support systems, while introducing a real-time data collection tool in city workshops. Our objective is to develop an overarching framework for CFP comparison, addressing the current lack of a robust framework for cross-country and cross-city analysis.\n\nOur methods comprise event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, focusing on professionalized CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings. We will particularly examine provider interrelationships, operational modes, and ties with state and non-state authorities, as well as CFP's role in poor people’s survival strategies.\n\nRecognizing the significance of CFP as a crucial buffer between food insecurity and hunger, especially post-Great Recession, this research aims to contribute to the shift towards sustainable food surplus use and waste reduction. By contextualizing CFP within welfare and civil society regimes and examining the influence of agri-food sustainability transitions, we seek to offer comparative insight into food support and insecurity.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this research is the creation of new knowledge across multiple studies, which can be extended to other countries and cities. This project will not only fill existing research gaps but also contribute to societal changes with reduced welfare benefits, reflecting the growing importance of CFP in contemporary society."
