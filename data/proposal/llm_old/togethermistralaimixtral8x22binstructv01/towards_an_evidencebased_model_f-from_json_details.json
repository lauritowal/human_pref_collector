        " This proposal, titled \"Towards an evidence-based model for big data policing: Evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological and legal and ethical conditions,\" aims to address the fragmented expertise and lack of interdisciplinary research in big data policing in Europe. The project seeks to develop an evidence-based model for big data policing by integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions. The proposed model utilizes historical data, including previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity, to predict high-risk crime locations and optimize police resource deployment.\n\nRecognizing the knowledge gaps in the field, such as insufficient scientific evaluations of big data policing models, this project aims to test its model through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles. The project will be divided into four PhD tracks: statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical, each contributing to the overall goal of creating a transparent and reliable big data policing model.\n\nUnlike commercial and economic initiatives, this project's innovation aspect lies in its focus on transparency regarding predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and adherence to legal and ethical standards. This approach not only aims to reduce crime rates but also to ensure the responsible use of big data in policing."
