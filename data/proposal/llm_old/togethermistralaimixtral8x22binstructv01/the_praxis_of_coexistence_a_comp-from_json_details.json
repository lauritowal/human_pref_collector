        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity,\" presents a novel empirical, inductive, and comparative research program that aims to explore and understand the dynamics of ethno-religious coexistence in diverse communities. The study will be conducted in various contexts, including Europe, the United States, India, and Israel, with a primary focus on ordinary coexistence and religious and ethnic diversity.\n\nThe key objectives of this research are to understand the spontaneous practices of coexistence, inform better policy through empirical study, enlighten about community expectations for coexistence, and explore the resources utilized to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. By adopting a comparative and inductive approach, the study aims to open theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence, while also taking culture and existing practices into account for resolving diversity dilemmas.\n\nThe central research questions guiding this project are: \"How do communities accommodate difference spontaneously?\" and \"What resources do they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict?\" Ultimately, this research endeavors to provide valuable insights into the complexities of coexistence in diverse societies, contributing to more informed and effective policies and practices that foster peace and understanding."
