        " In this groundbreaking endeavour, our proposal, \"Understanding and Embracing Artificial Agents' Impact on the Social Dynamics of Families\" (F-AI-MILY), seeks to delve into and comprehend the influence of artificial agents on family social dynamics. By synergizing insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction, we aim to establish a new, group-centred mobile-lab approach for studying family neurocognition.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: (1) to elucidate developmental changes in social dynamics during long-term interactions with artificial agents, (2) to pinpoint how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can bolster households with chronic illness, and (3) to guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households.\n\nOur interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, full-circle approach encompasses several innovative methods. We will develop a group-centred mobile lab to study social dynamics impacted by artificial agents, measure behavioural and brain measures of attitudes and behaviours of family members, and test child development interaction with artificial agents' impact. Furthermore, we will examine the long-term effects of living with an artificial agent on families with children aged 4-12.\n\nOur primary aims are twofold: (1) to uncover social dynamics with unprecedented detail and clarity, and (2) to facilitate a shift from maladaptive to adaptive social dynamics in families coping with chronic illness. Through this pioneering research, we aspire to redefine the role of artificial agents in our social fabric and foster more resilient, supportive family environments."
