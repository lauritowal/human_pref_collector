        " This proposal, titled \"Temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes,\" aims to investigate the influence of welfare regimes on gender inequality, with a particular focus on time use and its impact on family outcomes. Utilizing Esping-Andersen’s 'three worlds' framework, the research will concentrate on gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use across four East Asian societies: China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The study will adopt a comparative approach, contrasting these societies with Western counterparts to understand the nuances of gender inequality across different contexts.\n\nKey concepts explored in this study include unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, public policies, gender division of labour, social inequality, modern technology, care provision, domestic labour, leisure time, and enjoyment. The research will employ cross-national and historical comparative analysis, leveraging time diary data and household panel data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe study will operate at multiple levels, including household, societal, and life course, to capture the complex interplay of factors contributing to gender inequality. The primary objective is to elucidate how different welfare regimes shape gender roles, time use, and family outcomes, thereby shedding light on the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western societies. The findings from this research will contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge on social policy, gender studies, and welfare regimes, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in their efforts to promote gender equality."
