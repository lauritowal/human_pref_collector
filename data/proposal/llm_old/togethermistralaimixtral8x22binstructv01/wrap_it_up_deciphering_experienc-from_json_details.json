        " The grant proposal titled \"Wrap It Up: Deciphering experience-dependent myelin growth across development\" (WRAPPED) aims to address a critical gap in our understanding of changes in myelin during learning across different developmental stages. WRAPPED focuses on assessing myelin changes within the living human brain over time and between individuals, probing the entire developmental lifespan. This includes evaluating changes when infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults are acquiring novel skills such as juggling and reading Chinese.\n\nWRAPPED employs an innovative two-pronged approach, combining local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. The primary objective is to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory, which will serve as a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.\n\nThe methodology involves using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to provide non-invasive, high-resolution images of the brain, enabling the study of myelin changes over time and between individuals. This proposal seeks funding to support the comprehensive research, data collection, and analysis necessary to achieve the outlined objectives and contribute significantly to the field of neuroscience and neurological disorders."
