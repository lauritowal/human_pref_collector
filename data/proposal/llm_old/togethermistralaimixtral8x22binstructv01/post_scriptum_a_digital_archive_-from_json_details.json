        " The proposed project, \"Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain),\" aims to systematically collect, edit, and historically-linguistically study personal letters from the 17th to early 19th century in Portugal and Spain. The project will focus on letters from diverse authors such as servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters, which were often involved with institutions like the Inquisition and civil courts. The research will delve into inter-personal modes of relation within traditional communities, as reflected in the content characteristics of the letters, including oral rhetoric, expression of emotions, commonsense statements, confession of non-orthodox beliefs, and narration of trivial incidents. The project will follow the editing standards of Textualâ€‹ Criticism and will result in a large collection assembly, an online digital edition, philological treatment, and a cultural and linguistic study. Additionally, sociological interviews will be used to supplement the study. This project will contribute to a well-contextualized study of ordinary writings, providing valuable insights into the social and cultural dynamics of the period."
