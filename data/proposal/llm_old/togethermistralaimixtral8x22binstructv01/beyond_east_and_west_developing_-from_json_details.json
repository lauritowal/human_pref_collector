        " The proposed project, \"Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice,\" aims to integrate Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. This innovative project seeks to train traditional instrumentalists and singers in new repertoire, while also training Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques. By developing approaches for modeling music's impacts on musicians and audiences, this project will create an ensemble interface with newly designed instruments and produce studies on timbre. Furthermore, it will establish a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nKey activities include research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, performance training for traditional and Western musicians, development of ensemble interface, timbre studies, and mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems. The outputs of this project will be an e-book titled \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds, and online audio and visual examples. These outputs will be published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to develop a model for transcultural musical practice and overcoming cultural barriers. This project will not only contribute to the field of musicology but also foster cultural understanding and exchange between the East and West. We invite funding agencies to support this pioneering endeavor that will make a significant impact on the global music community."
