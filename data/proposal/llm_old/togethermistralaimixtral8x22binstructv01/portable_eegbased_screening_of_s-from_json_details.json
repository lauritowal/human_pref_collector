        " This proposal, titled \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns,\" aims to revolutionize the early detection of at-risk newborns for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by designing a portable, wireless EEG-based device. The project's primary goals include creating an easy-to-use, rapid, and automatic testing device for face processing in any context and developing an early, objective EEG-based biomarker for newborns at risk. Key features of this innovative device include an EEG-based index of face processing, requiring less than two minutes of newborn visual attention, an oscillatory visual presentation, dry electrodes, and an automatic online extraction algorithm. The benefits of this project are substantial, including the identification of ASD biomarkers, facilitation of early behavioral intervention for ASD, and the potential for large-scale screening protocols. Currently, there is a significant gap in the market, as no fully portable EEG system for newborns is available. This project leverages wireless EEG device technology and low-power design to address this need. Potential use cases include home testing and research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions. The device merges an innovative experimental paradigm with portable EEG technology to assess newborns' social processing abilities. This project has the potential to significantly impact the field of ASD research and early intervention."
