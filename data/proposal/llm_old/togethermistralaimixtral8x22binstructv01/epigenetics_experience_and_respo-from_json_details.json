        " This grant proposal, titled \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders,\" aims to explore the ethical dimensions and conceptual changes associated with epigenetics in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our focus areas include epigenetics, ethics, and neurodevelopmental disorders, with a particular emphasis on understanding the impact of social and physical environments on these conditions.\n\nThe project will investigate conceptual changes such as innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, and biological/psychosocial factors that contribute to the development of neurodevelopmental disorders. We will employ both theoretical and empirical investigation methods to delve into the nuances of these topics.\n\nOur target concepts are capacity responsibility and normative responsibility, which will be analyzed in relation to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nThe professional stakeholders involved in this project include persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families, who will contribute valuable insights and experiences. By engaging with these stakeholders, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications of epigenetics for neurodevelopmental disorders, ultimately contributing to the burgeoning field of neuroepigenethics."
