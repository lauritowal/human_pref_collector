        " The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa) is an ambitious research project aimed at understanding the evolution of human cultures through the transmission of written artefacts. By focusing on approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, LostMa seeks to determine the role of chance in the preservation or loss of written artefacts and analyze how manuscript texts were copied, transformed, or destroyed. This project will employ a combination of artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to examine the transmission of texts as a process akin to the evolution of organisms or language variants, involving innovation/mutation, fixation, or extinction.\n\nLostMa's objectives include understanding the role of humans in cultural transmission and investigating the survival of texts and formation of cultural canons. To achieve these goals, the project will utilize methods such as analysis of manuscript text copying and transformation, stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection. The case study for this project will be chivalric literature in the European context, with a focus on Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages.\n\nThe project will analyze a total of 4000 documents, aiming to shed light on the complex and dynamic processes that shape the transmission of texts and cultural evolution. By understanding these processes, LostMa will contribute to our knowledge of how human cultures evolve and the factors that influence the survival or loss of written artefacts. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of cultural evolution and the role of written artefacts in shaping human cultures."
