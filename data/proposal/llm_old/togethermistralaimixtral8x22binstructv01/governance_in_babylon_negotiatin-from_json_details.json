        " Title: Governance in Babylon: Negotiating the Rule of Three Empires\n\nThis interdisciplinary project, GoviB, aims to investigate the governance of ancient Babylon under the influence of three empires—Assyrian, Chaldean, and Persian—spanning from the late 8th century BC to the 4th century BC. The project's key focus revolves around understanding the local negotiation of imperial rule and the strategies employed by rulers to maintain stability or confront instability. Despite challenges posed by incomplete historical data and ambiguous data interpretations, the project will leverage a substantial body of resources. These include Neo-Babylonian archival texts, archaeological materials from German excavations in Babylon, and collections at the Vorderasiatische Museum in Berlin.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of politics and authority in Babylon, and to evaluate the impact of these empires on cultural transformation. It will also challenge modern perceptions of 'oriental governance' and 'regime stability.' The research will employ a governance studies conceptual framework to analyze the data, ensuring a rigorous and systematic approach.\n\nSuccessful completion of this project will contribute significantly to the field of ancient history and governance studies. It will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of power, negotiation, and stability in ancient societies, which can inform contemporary debates on governance and regime stability. Furthermore, the project's findings will enrich museum collections and exhibitions, fostering public understanding and appreciation of ancient Babylonian culture and history."
