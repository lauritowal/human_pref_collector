        " This proposal, titled \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged,\" aims to address the significant yet underdetected prevalence of major depression (1-3%) and clinically significant depression symptoms (8-16%) among the elderly, for which current treatment effectiveness remains moderate. The proposal prioritizes preventive intervention, targeting insomnia, a prevalent risk factor affecting up to 40% of the elderly population and increasing the risk of depression by 13%. The project goals are threefold: early identification of at-risk individuals, quantification of the mechanism, and enrollment in intervention protocols. Our approach involves a multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging to identify insomnia subtypes, employing an interdisciplinary strategy that combines subtype profiling, mechanism profiling, and intervention optimization. The intervention format is designed to be internet-supported and home-applicable, with a primary focus on improving sleep and preventing depression. By implementing these strategies, we aim to mitigate the negative impact of insomnia on mood in the elderly population."
