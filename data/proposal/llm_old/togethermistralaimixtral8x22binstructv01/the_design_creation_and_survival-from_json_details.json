        " The proposed project, \"The Design, Creation and Survival of Democratic Laws\" (DEMOLAW), aims to analyze legislative texts from the US, UK, and EU, addressing three major research questions: 1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law? 2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary? 3) How can we explain the stability or change in laws over time? Utilizing cutting-edge computational methods, DEMOLAW seeks to offer a novel conceptual perspective on legislative design and an integrated theoretical framework on legislation creation and survival.\n\nThe project will evaluate legislative texts based on analytical dimensions such as versatility and precision. This approach will enable methodological advancements for computational analysis of legislative content, contributing significantly to the field. By examining political systems in the US, UK, and EU, DEMOLAW will provide a comprehensive understanding of democratic legislation design, creation, and survival.\n\nThe proposed project's findings will have far-reaching implications for legislative scholars, policymakers, and practitioners, enhancing their ability to draft, implement, and amend laws more effectively. The project will also promote interdisciplinary collaboration between political science, law, and computer science, fostering a more holistic approach to understanding and improving democratic legislation. Ultimately, DEMOLAW aspires to make a significant impact on the quality, adaptability, and longevity of democratic laws, thereby strengthening democratic governance and institutions."
