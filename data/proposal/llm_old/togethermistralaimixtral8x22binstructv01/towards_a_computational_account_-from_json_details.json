        " The proposed project may be titled \"Towards a computational account of natural sequential behavior,\" with the primary objective of developing computational models to identify and characterize perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks. By understanding and modeling sequential actions involving perceptual uncertainty and action variability, we aim to characterize internal and external costs and benefits in the context of optimal sequential decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will employ behavioral experiments that integrate psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. Our tasks will include classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making, among others.\n\nThe outcomes of our research will include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, and subjective costs and benefits including effort, as well as action variability. Our previous work in experimental visuomotor behavior and theoretical modeling of behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis will greatly inform this project.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the computational mechanisms underlying natural sequential behavior, with potential applications in artificial intelligence, robotics, and human-machine interaction. We believe that this research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of human cognition and action."
