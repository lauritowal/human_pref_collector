        " The proposed project, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" aims to promote work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe through social policies for sustainable work and family/self-care time. Focusing on the role of trade unions in developing statutory care-related leave rights and protections, this research will examine women's predominance in caregiving and union membership. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, including quantitative analysis in rich democracies since 1965 and qualitative analysis in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, this project will investigate policy areas such as child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. In different institutional settings, this research will explore the mechanisms of union influence and contribute to interdisciplinary fields like comparative policy analysis and social movement research. By advancing comparative labour studies and developing theories of union-policy relationships, this project aims to assess the role of organized labour as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. The development of longitudinal, comparative data on care leave provisions will support this endeavor.\n\nWord count: 175"
