        " This proposal, titled \"Repetition, Parallelism and Creativity: An Inquiry into the Construction of Meaning in Ancient Mesopotamian Literature and Erudition\" (REPAC), aims to explore the intricate relationship between textual form and function in Ancient Mesopotamian literary and scholarly compositions. Focusing on the first millennium BCE, the project will delve into Akkadian texts inscribed on clay tablets using Cuneiform script, specifically those related to literary, magical, and mantic genres.\n\nThe investigation will center on textual features such as exact repetition, variant repetition, parallelism, refrain, and ring composition, as well as their poetic, rhetorical, and argumentative functions. These features are believed to serve aesthetic ornamentation, analogical reasoning, argument construction, and magical action, thus providing insight into the scribes' worldview. This worldview is characterized by beliefs in interconnection, causal effectiveness, and similarity.\n\nThe project seeks to fill a significant knowledge gap in understanding the role of worldview and analogy in Mesopotamian literary and scholarly method. The expected outcome is an improved understanding of the Ancient Mesopotamian creative effort, thereby enriching our comprehension of this civilization's intellectual and cultural heritage. This research promises to contribute significantly to the field of Mesopotamian studies and the broader humanities."
