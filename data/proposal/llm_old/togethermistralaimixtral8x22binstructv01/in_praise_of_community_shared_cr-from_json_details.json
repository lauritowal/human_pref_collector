        " This grant proposal, titled \"In praise of community: shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979)\", aims to explore the performing arts as a result of commonality practices during the 1960s and 1970s in Italy. The research objectives are to study, collect, and contextualize artist collaborations; apply the \"will-to-the-common\" concept to counterculture art; highlight the significance of artistic communities locally and internationally; and create a digital archive of Italian artists' performances.\n\nThe study will engage with historical, philosophical, and artistic debates, and draw on sociology and Social Network Theory. The methodology will involve new modeling of performing arts knowledge and interpretation and innovative digital archive visualization. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive approach to collection, digitalization, restoration, and dissemination of the Italian performing arts heritage.\n\nThe proposed project, known as INCOMMON, will be the first to systematically analyze the field of performing arts as a result of the practice of commonality, both theorized and experienced over the 1960s and 1970s. This project will contribute to the preservation of Italian cultural heritage, while also providing new insights into the role of artistic communities in shaping cultural and political discourse. The innovative digital archive visualization will make this research accessible to a wide audience, enabling further study and appreciation of this significant period in Italian performing arts history."
