        " This grant proposal, titled \"Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition,\" aims to investigate the impact of citizenship on migrant integration, considering the influence of policy variations on legal status transitions and integration outcomes. Our primary objectives include modeling migrants' legal status transitions as life course events and analyzing the significance of citizenship for various aspects such as work and income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment. We will develop innovative methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and assess policy impact.\n\nOur research will utilize longitudinal and survey-based micro-data from eight European and North American countries to test our models. The target population for this study includes immigrants and their children, as we believe a comprehensive understanding of citizenship's role in integration outcomes is crucial for this demographic.\n\nBy analyzing data from diverse countries, we aim to inform targeted citizenship policies that can maximize settlement success. Our findings will contribute to the ongoing discourse on migration and integration, and provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to create more effective and inclusive immigration policies. This project promises to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between legal status transitions, policy variations, and integration outcomes, ultimately fostering a more equitable and successful migrant integration process."
