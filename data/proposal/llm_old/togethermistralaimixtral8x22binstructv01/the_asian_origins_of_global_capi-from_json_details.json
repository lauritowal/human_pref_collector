        " This five-year research project, titled \"The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\", aims to investigate the origins of modern industrial capitalism by focusing on the role of Asian ports and European East India companies in global trade and economic dynamism during the 1500-1800 period. The project will explore key concepts such as factories, factors, intercontinental trade, and the spatial theory of capitalist development, aligning with the New History of Capitalism and the decolonization of the history of capitalism.\n\nThe research questions will revolve around the economic activities in imperial trading centers and the interactive roles of European and local merchants. The primary objectives of this project include mapping the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, and recasting the narrative of global economic change and capitalism.\n\nThe methodology will involve the integration of large archival repositories and collaborations with scholars globally. The project intends to investigate over 150 factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development. By examining the economic activities in these factories, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the origins of global capitalism, challenging the Eurocentric narratives that have dominated historiography.\n\nThis project will contribute significantly to the field of economic history, offering new insights into the spatial dimensions of capitalist development and the role of Asian ports in shaping global economic change. It will also foster international academic collaboration and provide opportunities for scholars to engage with diverse archival sources, promoting a more inclusive and global approach to the history of capitalism."
