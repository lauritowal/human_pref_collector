        " In our grant proposal titled \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict,\" we aim to explore the multifaceted role of social media in shaping conflict dynamics in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa over a period of five years. Our overarching goal is to extend Internet reach to remote regions, particularly non-urban areas and regions with weak state presence, in order to enhance affordable access for the world's poor and conflict-affected communities.\n\nThe project will delve into the complex interplay between social media and conflict, with a key puzzle being the impact of social media access on peace-building efforts versus its potential to perpetuate violence. We will address three primary research questions: (1) the influence of social media on transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, (2) the role of public authorities in using social media to either encourage violence or promote peace, and (3) the transformative effects of social media on individuals' experiences with violent conflict.\n\nTo contextualize our examination, we will consider the prevalence of dangerous speech online, the entry and exit of individuals into conflict, the tactics employed by various actors to shape the Internet, and the use of social media by governance actors. By closely examining the role of social media in religious and political violence in Eastern Africa, we hope to shed light on the intricate dynamics of conflict and peacebuilding in the digital age."
