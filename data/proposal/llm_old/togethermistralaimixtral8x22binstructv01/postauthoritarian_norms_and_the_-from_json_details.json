        " This proposal, titled \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships,\" aims to investigate the enduring ideological associations with past authoritarian regimes and their influence on norms in new democracies. Focusing on countries such as Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe between 2015 and 2019, this project employs survey experiments to examine phenomena such as the left-wing party decline in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the higher likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. The study delves deep into voters' avoidance of association with ideologies of past dictatorships and the impact on both the demand and supply side of party competition. By investigating citizens' ideological preferences, perceptions of party stances, national identity, political discussions, and the supply of new parties, this research aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving political competition heterogeneity across new democracies. The expected output is a novel theory that explains the rejection of the ideological brand of the past authoritarian regime, contributing significantly to our understanding of post-transition party names, programmatic stances, and party elite discourse."
