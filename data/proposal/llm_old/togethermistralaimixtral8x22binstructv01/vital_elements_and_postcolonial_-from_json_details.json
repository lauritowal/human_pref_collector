        " In the grant proposal titled \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town,\" we propose a comprehensive study focusing on understanding the end of lives in the Mediterranean context, specifically in Zarzis, Tunisia. Our approach, \"forensics as the art of paying attention,\" aims to map unliveable life conditions by examining resources crucial for life and their interrelations in Zarzis.\n\nOur methodology includes five case studies: phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment. These case studies will provide a holistic perspective on the vital elements concept, advancing it through a decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa. We will also develop forensics as a method for ethnographic study, a novel and innovative approach to the field.\n\nOur project emphasizes collaborative work, including team site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists in the Vital Elements Atelier. Through these collaborations, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the vital elements concept and its implications in the specific context of Zarzis.\n\nOur proposal is not only innovative in its decolonial approach and the development of forensics as an ethnographic method but also in its focus on the understudied region of Zarzis, Tunisia. By understanding the end of lives in this Mediterranean harbour town, we hope to contribute to broader discussions on resource management, environmental degradation, and postcolonial studies. We believe that our project will provide valuable insights into the interplay of vital elements and their impact on life conditions, paving the way for more informed and sustainable decision-making in the future."
