        " This grant proposal, titled \"Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School,\" aims to develop and assess the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I., a serious game designed to aid children in navigating the challenges of transitioning to high school. Led by the ERC-team (ERC consolidator grant Social-Bio Interplay), the project addresses pressing issues such as peer rejection, victimization, low support from teachers, and conflictual relations with teachers, which negatively impact self-regulation and stress-regulation in children. A.L.I.B.I. offers a virtual high school environment where players must uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer, fostering prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and consideration of multiple response options. The game prioritizes long-term perspectives and provides a realistic yet safe learning environment to rehearse prosocial behaviors. Its appealing design incorporates game elements and is presented on a tablet computer. The project's goals include developing A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game, assessing its effectiveness, integrating it into ongoing school transition trainings, and creating a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe.\n\nThree school counseling organizations will be implementation partners, and the project will target three regions in The Netherlands. By providing a tailored and engaging approach to addressing the social and emotional challenges of transitioning to high school, this project promises to significantly improve children's well-being and academic success."
