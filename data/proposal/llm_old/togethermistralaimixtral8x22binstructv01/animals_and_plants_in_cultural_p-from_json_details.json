        " Title: Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\n\nThis research project aims to explore the hypothesis that cultural productions about the Amazon River Basin, such as texts, cinema, and art, highlight the dynamic role of non-human beings in shaping human cultural life. The main challenge is to assess how these cultural productions lend a voice to animals and plants, thus contributing to environmental humanities, Amazonian perspectives on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies.\n\nThe project is structured into three research streams. Stream I, Amazonian Zoophytography, focuses on formulating a definition of zoophytography and tracing its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies and Western philosophy. Stream II, Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out, concentrates on the articulation of animals in cultural productions. Stream III, Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations, centers on the inscription of plants in texts, cinema, and artworks.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, revealing the interdependence of humans and non-humans, drawing attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia, and uncovering equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants. The project introduces the concept of zoophytography to describe the inscription of non-human beings in cultural productions, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making.\n\nBy examining the role of non-human beings in cultural productions about the Amazon River Basin, this project seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of human, animal, and plant life, ultimately fostering more sustainable and equitable relationships with the environment."
