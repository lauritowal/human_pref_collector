        " In our grant proposal titled \"How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics,\" we aim to explore the polarizing effects of nationalism on electoral politics in advanced democracies and evaluate the potential for national identities to foster unity. Our research framework contrasts the prevailing model of a transnational cleavage rooted in cultural conflict with a novel perspective centered on diverse forms of nationalism.\n\nWe propose a multi-method comparative research design to achieve our objectives. Our first work package involves analyzing novel survey data to understand how public perceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions, utilizing open-ended survey questions. The second package focuses on examining elite mobilization efforts based on distinct varieties of nationalism. Lastly, our third work package delves into the impact of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nOur research intends to contribute significantly to academic advancements in the field, providing new insights into the complex relationship between nationalism and political polarization. Moreover, our findings will enrich public debates surrounding pressing societal challenges, fostering a more nuanced understanding of nationalism's role in shaping political landscapes. Ultimately, this project seeks to illuminate potential avenues for harnessing national identities as a force for unity rather than division in democratic societies."
