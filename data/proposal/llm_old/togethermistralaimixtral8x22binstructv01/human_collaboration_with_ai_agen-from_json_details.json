        " This grant proposal, titled \"Human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance: organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI,\" aims to investigate the complex interplay between human decision-makers and AI systems within the context of big data-driven national health governance. Utilizing a multi-sited ethnographic approach, the study will focus on six diverse national settings, with the overarching goal of developing a comprehensive theory on organizational factors influencing the ethical application of AI in healthcare.\n\nThe project will scrutinize moments of human intervention with AI, drawing on concepts such as algorithmic ethics, ethical AI, big data, and AI systems. It will address significant research gaps concerning the socio-cultural context, organizational collaboration with AI, and empirical evidence of human intervention with AI. To achieve these objectives, the study will employ future-scenarioing anthropological methods and foster partnerships with health decision-makers and policy institutions.\n\nThe expected impact of this research is twofold. Firstly, it will contribute to the formulation of more ethical and effective national health policies, by providing empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the nuanced relationship between human experts and AI systems. Secondly, it will have a tangible impact on individual human lives, as improved health governance and ethical AI integration can lead to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment plans, and ultimately, improved health outcomes."
