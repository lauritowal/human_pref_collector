        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought,\" seeks to conduct an interdisciplinary and comparative study of early contributions to formalism in the field of Philosophy of Science and Logic during the first half of the twentieth century. The project aims to illuminate the historical and philosophical underpinnings of formalism, focusing on its significant impact on various subfields of logic and philosophy.\n\nThe project is divided into three subprojects. The first, \"Historical reconstruction,\" will delve into the foundations of formalism by examining the influences of nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology on formalist thought from 1860 to 1910. Key figures in this period include Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp.\n\nThe second subproject, \"Comparative study,\" will explore the formal turn in logic and logical empiricism from 1920 to 1940, with a focus on the works of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. This comparative analysis will shed light on the evolution of formalism and its role in shaping modern logical empiricism.\n\nFinally, the \"Analysis of philosophical implications\" subproject will investigate the philosophical implications of formalism, including semantics in logic and philosophy, the philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories. By examining these topics, the project seeks to contribute to ongoing debates in contemporary philosophy and logic.\n\nIn conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of the formal turn in twentieth-century thought, with the potential to enrich our understanding of the development and implications of formalism in philosophy and logic."
