        " This grant proposal, titled \"Pliocene Hominin Dispersal to southern Africa: Choice or Chance?\", aims to investigate the dispersal patterns of early hominins from higher latitudes to southern Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. This project seeks to explore the unique human trait of adaptability to various environments by examining geomorphological and palaeoecological changes, dynamic precipitation and vegetation models, and conducting anatomical, functional, and morphometric analyses of fossils. Additionally, the project will appraise species diversity, gene flow, and dispersal scenarios to gain a comprehensive understanding of early hominin dispersal.\n\nThe project will test three key hypotheses. Firstly, during the period >2.6Ma, it is proposed that East African hominin ranges expanded and contracted with wet and dry phases, leading to the reproductive isolation of southernmost populations, who are believed to be descendants of Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis. Secondly, during the period ~2.6-1.5Ma, the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation is thought to have closed and opened dispersal corridors, resulting in intermittent hybridization between East African and southern African hominins. Lastly, it is hypothesized that tectonic and hydrographic changes after ~1.5Ma led to the formation of the Zambezi River barrier, resulting in endemic southern African hominins and the exploitation of distinct ecological niches due to competition.\n\nThis multidisciplinary project aims to combine paleoecological, anatomical, and genetic data to provide a holistic understanding of early hominin dispersal to southern Africa."
