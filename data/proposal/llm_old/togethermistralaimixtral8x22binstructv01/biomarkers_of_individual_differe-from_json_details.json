        " This grant proposal, titled \"Biomarkers of individual differences in human cortical visual processing,\" aims to elucidate the effects of physiological state and personality traits on vision. Our primary objective is to bridge the gap in understanding why normally sighted individuals, including young children, perceive visual stimuli differently. By leveraging innovative approaches and state-of-the-art methodologies, we aspire to provide new knowledge on the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception.\n\nOur interdisciplinary research team will employ a combination of pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics to investigate the co-variation of behavioral and cortical properties with personality traits. We will also explore the potential impacts of our findings on the understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and the development of therapeutic approaches affecting general physiology.\n\nA key innovative aspect of our project is the integration of visual processing measures with physiological interventions, such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity. This approach will enable us to identify new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and generate evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolism.\n\nUltimately, our expected outcomes will not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the human visual system but also pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the field of visual perception and developmental disorders."
