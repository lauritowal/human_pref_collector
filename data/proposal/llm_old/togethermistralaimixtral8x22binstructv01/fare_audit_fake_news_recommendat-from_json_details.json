    "title": "FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results",
    "descriptions": [
        " The FARE_AUDIT project aims to develop an auditing system for search engines that can track and analyze the spread of disinformation in near real-time. This innovative tool will simulate different user profiles to understand how browsing history influences search engine results and the likelihood of directing users to disinformation. The proposed system will not require real user data, ensuring privacy protection, and will utilize privacy-protecting web-crawlers to gather necessary information.\n\nThe primary objectives of FARE_AUDIT are threefold: to understand the relationship between browsing history and search engine results, to create a system for identifying new disinformation in near real-time, and to breach information bubbles by simulating different user online profiles. The anticipated outcomes of this project include an increase in public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread and equipping democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens with a disinformation detection and monitoring tool.\n\nFARE_AUDIT also addresses the technology shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting. As the digital landscape evolves, it is crucial to adapt and innovate to ensure the integrity of information and protect users' privacy. This project aims to fill the gap in current efforts to understand and curtail the role of search engines in spreading disinformation. By providing a comprehensive and privacy-protecting auditing tool, FARE_AUDIT will contribute significantly to the ongoing fight against disinformation."
