        " This grant proposal, titled \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era,\" aims to explore the evolution of Buddhism through critical examination of textual material in Indic languages, specifically Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts, from the first millennium of the Common Era.\n\nThe project's geographical focus spans Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India, with recent discoveries from the Mes Aynak archeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand enriching the scope of the study. Utilizing philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, the study will delve into the textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of these manuscripts.\n\nThe proposed research will culminate in a comprehensive digital archive, including the creation of an akṣara database, ensuring the digital preservation of these valuable texts. Additionally, the project will produce editions and translations of the manuscripts, supplemented by in-depth textual, paleographical, and codicological feature studies. A unique aspect of this project is the multi-language content comparison, which will provide a nuanced understanding of the development of Buddhist textuality.\n\nThis research endeavor will not only contribute significantly to the fields of Buddhist studies, philology, and paleography but also underscore the importance of digital preservation in safeguarding our cultural and historical heritage."
