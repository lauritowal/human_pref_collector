        " This groundbreaking proposal, titled \"What are the origins of empathy? A comparative developmental investigation,\" aims to conduct the first comparative study of empathy development in humans and bonobos. Utilizing advanced techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, the project will employ longitudinal observations and innovative experiments to explore empathy development within distributed-caregiving societal structures. Both human infants from Vanuatu and Samoa and bonobos from wild and semi-captive contexts will be studied to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy.\n\nThe research goals include determining the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, challenging perspectives about human exceptionalism in this domain, and advancing our understanding of empathy origins. Guided by hypotheses that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but that humans diverge in motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states and possess a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange, this project seeks to uncover potential outcomes like human-unique sharing and cooperation.\n\nBy integrating multiple disciplines such as biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, this investigation promises to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of empathy's origins. Ultimately, the insights gained from this project could reshape our perspectives on human-animal similarities and differences, with profound implications for the study of empathy, social cognition, and the evolution of human behavior."
