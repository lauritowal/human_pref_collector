        " This grant proposal, titled \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence\" (UrbTerr), seeks to comprehensively examine memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in four European countries: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Over the period of 2004-2019, these nations have collectively experienced more than ten terrorist attacks, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. The UrbTerr project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining after attacks, develop a new materialist approach to terrorism, and assess policies and security infrastructures.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project include producing two academic monographs, several peer-reviewed journal articles, and a co-edited volume. Additionally, UrbTerr will create a website featuring interviews, support two PhD theses, and facilitate public performances by 'Center for Political Beauty' as alternative forms of remembering and future visions. The project aims to offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in Europe, contributing significantly to the academic and policy-making discourse on terrorism and its societal implications. By understanding the complex interplay of memory, culture, and violence in the aftermath of terrorism, UrbTerr will ultimately enhance our capacity to imagine and anticipate violence, fostering more resilient and peaceful societies."
