        " This research proposal, titled \"Developing and delivering neurocomputational models to bridge between brain and mind,\" aims to advance our understanding of mental processes and their neural underpinnings in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. The primary objectives include deciphering the nature of mental processes, elucidating their emergence from neural machinery, and establishing the basis of neurological patients' impairments to enhance clinical management and treatment.\n\nThe project components involve investigating complex mental behaviors and underlying cognitive processes, mapping neural systems and their functions, and developing innovative methods and tools to bridge brain and mental behavior. Key activities include the convergence of methods and the development of a new type of neurocomputational model. The methods employed will span experimental psychology, behavioural neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies.\n\nThe project's goals are to secure robust methods and tools for systematically bridging cognitive science and systems neuroscience, execute neuroscience and cognitive methods concurrently, and force a convergence of results. The novel formalism for bridging brain and cognition will be achieved through computational models that mimic normal and impaired behavior and connect neuroanatomy and cognition. The proposed neurocomputational models will reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function while maintaining the capacity to simulate detailed cognitive behavior. This project promises to significantly contribute to our understanding of the brain-mind relationship and improve the clinical management of neurological patients."
