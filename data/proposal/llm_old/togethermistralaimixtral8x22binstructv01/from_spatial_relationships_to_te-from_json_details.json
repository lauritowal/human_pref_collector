        " This proposal, titled \"From Spatial Relationships to Temporal Correlations: New Vistas on Predictive Coding,\" aims to investigate the role of gamma waves (30-80 Hz) in cortical communication, synaptic plasticity, and their part in predictive coding within the visual cortex. The project will explore the significance of gamma waves in both neurological and psychiatric disorders, while also examining their encoding functions and their involvement in the predictive coding theory. This theory includes top-down predictions, bottom-up prediction errors, learning, and updating priors.\n\nThe project will test the standard view that gamma waves carry prediction errors, as well as a new hypothesis that they signal the match between predictions and sensory inputs, with long-range gamma synchronization predicting each other's visual input. To quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, a new method will be developed using deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and magnetoencephalography (MEG).\n\nSubjects, including marmosets and humans, will be tested on variables such as predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns. It is anticipated that gamma waves will be found to depend on experience and perceptual learning. Additionally, an optogenetics approach will be employed to test the hypothesis that gamma waves drive perceptual learning.\n\nThe project expects to find that V1 gamma waves depend on top-down feedback, and the anticipated outcome is evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, as well as their implications for neurological and psychiatric disorders."
