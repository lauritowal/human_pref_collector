        " The proposed research project, \"Late Ottoman Palestinians: Social and Cultural Dynamics in an Eastern Mediterranean Society during the Age of Empire, 1880-1920,\" aims to contribute significantly to global social and cultural history by examining the intricate social and cultural dynamics in late Ottoman Palestine during the period of 1880-1920. This project is situated within the broader context of European imperialism, Ottoman state building, and globalization, focusing on the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nThe primary research question explores the social strategies employed by late Ottoman Palestinians, transcending ethnic, religious, and class divides, to address challenges on both individual and collective levels. The hypothesis posits that an accumulation of individual actions led to the constant emergence and re-emergence of social formations.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the project will utilize census data as its primary data source and employ a comparative methodology, examining social practices across the region and beyond. The research aims to not only develop a theoretical framework and establish methodological standards but also create a Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) for the Ottoman Empire and study colonialism under the British Mandate.\n\nIn conclusion, this project seeks to illuminate the diverse social practices and strategies employed by late Ottoman Palestinians, offering valuable insights into the complex interplay of imperialism, globalization, and state building in the Eastern Mediterranean region during a transformative period in world history."
