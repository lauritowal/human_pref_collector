        " Our proposal, \"It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions\" (InterCom), aims to investigate multi-generational communication within and beyond family contexts. By merging laboratory research and real-world experimentation, we seek to collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during storytelling events. Our research questions revolve around age-related differences in brain rhythms, speech processing, and intergenerational miscommunications.\n\nWe will co-design storytelling events with community partners and use the data from real-world events to inform and constrain subsequent laboratory studies, and vice versa. Our objectives include combining laboratory and real-world data collection, as well as developing stimuli and analyzing data in a reciprocal manner between lab and real-world settings. Ultimately, we aim to understand multigenerational communication and generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations.\n\nOur innovative approach involves testing a novel 'community neuroscience' methodology, leveraging the benefits and offsetting the downsides of naturalistic observations and experimental control. This proposal will innovate on combining laboratory and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and data analysis, with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of intergenerational communication."
