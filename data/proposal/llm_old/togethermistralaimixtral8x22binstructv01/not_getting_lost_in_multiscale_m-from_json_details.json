    "title": "Not Getting Lost in Multi-Scale Maps: Exploring the Anchor Theory in Cartographic Zoom Interactions in the Context of Crisis Management",
    "descriptions": [
        " The LostInZoom project aims to revolutionize multi-scale map interactions by establishing new zooming paradigms based on multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors during zooming. This project is highly relevant due to the widespread use of multi-scale interactive maps in professional and daily contexts, and the lack of current guidelines for map design in this domain. Current map users often feel lost after zooming interactions on multi-scale maps, and map designers lack guidelines to create smooth exploratory experiences.\n\nThe primary objectives of this project include identifying multi-scale visual landmarks that act as anchors for map readers during zooming, designing new cartographic generalisation techniques for multi-scale maps, and creating new zooming interactions focused on identified landmarks. The proposed methods to achieve these objectives involve exploring the cognition of multi-scale interactive maps through experimentation, designing cartographic generalisation techniques, and designing zooming interactions.\n\nThe use case for this project is crisis management, where efficient and user-friendly multi-scale maps can significantly improve decision-making and response times. The LostInZoom project has the potential to significantly improve the user experience of multi-scale maps, making them more intuitive and easier to navigate. This, in turn, can enhance productivity and safety in various professional and daily contexts, particularly in crisis management scenarios."
