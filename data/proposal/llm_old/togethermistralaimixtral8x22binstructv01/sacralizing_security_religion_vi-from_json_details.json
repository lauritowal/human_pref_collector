        " The proposed project, \"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" (SACRASEC), aims to investigate the role of religious vigilantes in shaping authority and governance in urban settings, where state agencies lack the capacity to provide adequate infrastructure and security. Focusing on mega-cities in the Global South, such as Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, SACRASEC will employ an ethnographic comparison methodology to explore how religious organizations, non-state security actors, and vigilantes operate alongside state actors to maintain order. Key research questions include understanding why residents grant religious vigilantes authority and the role of religion in legitimizing vigilante practices. The project aims to analyze the production of authority among religious vigilantes, draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, and examine the specificities of various religious traditions within the context of vigilantism. By extending the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, SACRASEC will contribute valuable insights into power structures in mega-cities of the Global South and inform policies aimed at improving human security."
