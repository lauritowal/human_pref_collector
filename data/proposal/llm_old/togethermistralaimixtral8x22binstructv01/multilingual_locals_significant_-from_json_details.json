        " This grant proposal titled \"Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature\" aims to challenge the prevailing perception that non-Western literature must reference global timelines and maps, primarily circulated in English, to be considered 'world literature.' The proposal focuses on 'multilingual locals' and 'significant geographies' in study regions including north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, exploring key concepts such as 'literary multilingualism,' 'colonial diglossia,' and 'oral traditions.'\n\nThe project critiques the 'monolingual straitjacket' and partition of modern literary histories, proposing a 'multilingual and located' approach. It will examine the dynamics of 'appropriation,' 'co-constitution,' and 'multiplicity of choices and trajectories' in 'local transculturations,' 'debates on world literature,' 'forms of multilingualism,' and 'actors and technologies of print and orality.' The study periods span 'imperial consolidation,' 'decolonization,' and the 'current globalizing moment.'\n\nThe proposed project seeks to develop a theoretical approach, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues. It involves collaboration with Morocco, Ethiopia, India, UK, and France, emphasizing the global circulation and impact of translation in ensuring entry into the global canon. This research aims to redefine the dominant language and genre of world literature, thereby reshaping its global circulation and perception."
