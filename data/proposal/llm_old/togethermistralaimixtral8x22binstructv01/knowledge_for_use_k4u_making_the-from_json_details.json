        " Title: Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\n\nThis Horizon 2020 grant proposal aims to construct a new approach to utilizing social science for the development of more effective social policies. The K4U project will focus on the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation, and examining the role of values in the science/society interface. Current issues in the field include an excessive emphasis on knowledge production and a lack of attention to knowledge use.\n\nThe objectives of the K4U project are to develop a practical understanding for policy design and deliberation, as well as to balance effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. The project will adopt a Popperian philosophical approach to bridge the gap between theory and practice. By doing so, it will contribute to the launch of the philosophy of social technology field, providing intelligible and practical insights for users to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies.\n\nThe K4U project will address the need for a more comprehensive and balanced approach to social policy development, emphasizing the importance of knowledge use in conjunction with knowledge production. Through its philosophical approach and focus on practical applications, the K4U project will provide valuable contributions to the field of social science and policy development, ultimately leading to the creation of more effective and well-rounded social policies."
