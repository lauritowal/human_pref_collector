        " The proposed research project, \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,\" aims to explore how economic hardship influences support for socially conservative political agendas and how policy contexts at local and national levels impact this relationship. Amid growing prejudice towards marginalized groups in Europe and the rising support for far-right parties, this project addresses the critical knowledge gap regarding the link between financial crises and increased support for far-right parties.\n\nInformed by a multidisciplinary theoretical framework comprising political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics, the project hypothesizes that economic hardship instigates narratives of loss, which in turn trigger support for socially conservative political agendas. A multi-method empirical approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, will be employed to test these hypotheses.\n\nThe study will focus on five European countries—France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—with varying levels of compensation for economic hardship. By comparing these countries, the project seeks to uncover the role of context in shaping the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of the threats to community cohesion and inform policies aimed at mitigating these challenges."
