        " The proposed project, \"Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets,\" aims to address the pressing issue of cooperation problems in contemporary markets and societies, where cooperation is deemed essential for economic and social well-being. This project adopts an economic engineering approach, inspired by the work of Alvin Roth, to devise innovative solutions that promote cooperation and mitigate associated challenges.\n\nUtilizing experimental methods and behavioral game theory, the project comprises three primary work packages. The first package focuses on electronic reputation mechanisms to foster cooperation in the digital world, addressing the flaws in current trust mechanisms on the Internet. The second package explores mechanisms to avoid arms races for speed, specifically in real-time financial trading and electricity market trading, to tackle collective wastefulness and threats to market liquidity and stability. The third package delves into market designs that align with ethical considerations, using examples such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights, to address the distaste for certain kinds of transactions.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. These outcomes will not only contribute to the economic engineering field but also have broader implications for societal welfare and market stability."
