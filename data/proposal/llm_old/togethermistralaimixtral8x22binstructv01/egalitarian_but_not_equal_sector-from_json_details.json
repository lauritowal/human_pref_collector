        " Title: Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials,\" aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining through a comprehensive study of wage disparities in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The project, named WAGE, will employ ethnographic research methods to investigate the global average gender pay gap of 20% and the European average of 13%, as reported by the United Nations and Eurostat in 2022.\n\nFocusing on the metal sector (male-dominated) and nursing (female-dominated), WAGE will undertake three primary research objectives. First, the project will compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap (GPG) in the selected countries. Second, it will uncover and analyze daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases within these sectors. Lastly, the project will document and explain how actors in these sectors relate to wage norms and sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy examining these key areas, WAGE will provide valuable insights into the ways collective bargaining contributes to gendered wage differentials. This research has the potential to inform policy development and practice, ultimately fostering a more equitable wage structure across sectors and countries."
