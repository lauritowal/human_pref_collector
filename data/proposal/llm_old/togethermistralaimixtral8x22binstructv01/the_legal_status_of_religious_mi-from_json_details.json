        " Title: The Legal Status of Religional Minorities in the Euro-Mediterranean World (5th-16th Centuries)\n\nThis grant proposal aims to support a comprehensive research project on the legal status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe, spanning the 5th to 16th centuries, with a focus on the Euro-Mediterranean regions. The project's primary objective is to collect, publish, and study legal texts that defined the status of various religious groups, including Christians, Muslims, and other minorities. The sources for this research will encompass a wide range of legal texts, such as Roman law, Canon law, National or royal law, Urban law, Rabbinical responsa, and Fatwa collections. Specific sources include the Theodosius code, Justinian code, Acta of Church councils, Decretum attributed to Gratian, Decretales, Barbarian law codes, Siete Partidas, Fueros, and Hisba manuals. The project will ensure accessibility by translating these texts into English, French, and Spanish, in addition to their original languages.\n\nThe outputs of this project will include a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, workshops, an international conference, comparative thematic studies, proceedings of the international conference, a sourcebook of selected legal texts, and a monograph on the legal status of minorities. The project's goals are to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. The target audience for these outputs includes scholars, researchers in the history of minority law, and researchers in interreligious relations, making this project a major reference tool for research in these areas."
