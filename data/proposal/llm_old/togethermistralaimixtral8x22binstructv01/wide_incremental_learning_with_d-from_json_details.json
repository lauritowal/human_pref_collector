        " The proposed research, titled \"Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks\", aims to revolutionize our understanding of language beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches. Recognizing the evolution of human language over 50,000 years and the invention of the alphabet approximately 3,000 years ago, this study focuses on Western linguistic thinking and early childhood literacy training. Uniquely, it highlights the features of the Chinese writing system, such as juxtaposed characters without intervening spaces and context-dependent syllables instead of letters.\n\nThe research goal is to explore the potential of wide learning networks, specifically two-layer networks with many thousands of units, utilizing the simplest possible error-driven learning rule. These networks have demonstrated performance that mirrors human processing strengths and weaknesses. The proposed methodology aligns with current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe primary objective is to advance auditory comprehension development, model diverse languages, extend speech production, and develop a discrimination-based language theory. This research intends to challenge the dominant alphabet-centric approach to language understanding, suggesting that languages employ low-level properties of the acoustic signal to directly reduce uncertainty about the messages encoded in the speech signal. A funding request is made to support this innovative research program."
