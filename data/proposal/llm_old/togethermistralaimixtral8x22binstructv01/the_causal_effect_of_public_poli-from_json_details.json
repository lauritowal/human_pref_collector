        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital,\" aims to investigate the impact of various public policies and income shocks on child development in Spain, using a large-scale, 35-year dataset and advanced econometric techniques. Drawing upon the fetal origins hypothesis, this economics research project focuses on the \"missing middle\" period of child development, spanning ages 0-15. The study will examine the effects of several interventions and shocks, including household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks. The outcomes will be measured using objective indicators such as hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. The research will explore potential channels of influence, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. By providing robust evidence on the causal effects of public policies and income on child health and human capital, this study has significant policy implications. The findings will inform the design and implementation of effective interventions to improve child development outcomes and reduce socioeconomic disparities in Spain and beyond."
