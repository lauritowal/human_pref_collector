        " The Scale Revolution in Physics: Historical and Philosophical Perspectives (RESCALE) is a multifaceted project that aims to elucidate the historical and philosophical underpinnings of the shift towards scale-based theoretical practice in modern physics. This transformation, which has occurred since the 1950s, has resulted in theories that operate effectively within certain scales, contributing to a complex and layered world picture.\n\nThe RESCALE project is driven by four key objectives: (1) to comprehend the impact of the ideal of a final theory on modern physics and its philosophical interpretations; (2) to scrutinize the paradigm shift in physics towards scale-specific theories; (3) to evaluate the necessity for philosophers to recalibrate their interpretative practices in the context of scale-based physics; and (4) to explore the worldview that emerges from a scale-based perspective.\n\nThe significance of this study is twofold: (1) it unveils a profound epistemological transformation in the recent history of science; and (2) it addresses the implications of this transformation for our understanding of representation, reduction, realism, and metaphysics at the frontiers of science.\n\nThe methodology of the RESCALE project is two-pronged: (1) a historical study of the evolution of scale-based theoretical practice in physics; and (2) a philosophical analysis of the implications of scale-based physics.\n\nBy shedding light on the historical and philosophical aspects of scale-based physics, the RESCALE project promises to enrich our understanding of modern physics and its interpretations. This project will not only reveal a fundamental transformation in the history of science but also address its implications for our understanding of key philosophical concepts at the forefront of scientific inquiry."
