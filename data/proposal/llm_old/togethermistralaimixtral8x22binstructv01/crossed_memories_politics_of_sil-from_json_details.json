        " The proposed research project, Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times (CROME), aims to explore the memories and silences related to the wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961-1974/5. Adopting a diachronic and comparative approach, CROME will focus on Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe.\n\nCROME's key hypothesis posits that these wars triggered memorialization and silencing with their own historicity. The project will comprise two distinct strands: 'Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States' will examine the role of states in past mobilization, articulation, recognition, and selective representations; 'Memory as a battlefield' will explore the uses of the past and dynamics between social and individual memories.\n\nCROME's objectives include producing innovative knowledge about war memories and silences, contrasting changes in memory and silence from the end of the conflicts to the present, examining historical judgements and memories in Portugal and African countries, offering a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies, and addressing traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism. By comprehensively investigating these areas, CROME seeks to enrich our understanding of the complex legacies of the colonial-liberation wars and their enduring impact on contemporary societies."
