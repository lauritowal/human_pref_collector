        " The proposed project, titled \"Locus Ludi: The Cultural Fabric of Play and Games in Classical Antiquity,\" aims to deliver the first comprehensive study of the evidence of play and games in antiquity. This interdisciplinary project will span two significant time periods: the Greek world (c. 800 BCE - 146 BCE) and the Roman world (c. 500 BCE - c. 500 CE).\n\nThe project will explore the roles of various participants, including free men, slaves, men, women, adults, children, and even gods, in the contexts of urban and rural environments. The study will draw upon a diverse array of source types, such as written, archaeological, and iconographic evidence, to ensure a holistic understanding of play and games during these periods.\n\nThe research will focus on linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological aspects, shedding light on the cultural significance of play and games. Furthermore, the project will intersect with related fields like gender studies and education studies, providing valuable insights into the societal dynamics of the time.\n\nThe project's outputs will extend beyond the academic community, with the development of training models, research models, and educational materials suitable for schools, museums, and libraries. These resources will not only disseminate the project's findings but also foster a deeper appreciation for the cultural heritage of ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nIn conclusion, this project offers a unique opportunity to explore the rich tapestry of play and games in classical antiquity, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of these societies and enriching our contemporary perspectives."
