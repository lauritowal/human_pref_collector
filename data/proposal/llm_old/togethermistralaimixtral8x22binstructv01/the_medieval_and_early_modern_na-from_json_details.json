        " This grant proposal, titled \"The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use,\" aims to delve into the least studied and understood aspects of maritime expansion within the realm of the History of Cartography. The current state of research, though promising, is still in its infancy regarding detailed technical study. This proposal seeks to address a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period, building upon previous work that solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction.\n\nOur research will focus on three primary questions: the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, their technical evolution over time, and their use at sea. To answer these questions, we will employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining analytical cartometric methods, numerical modelling, and examination of manuscripts through special lighting. Our objectives include unveiling hidden graphic content, characterizing the main geometric features, establishing connections with navigational methods, and simulating chart construction numerically.\n\nThe impact of this research extends beyond the History of Cartography, contributing significantly to intellectual history at large. By investigating the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods, we hope to shed light on their origins, evolution, and use, thereby enriching our understanding of this critical period in human history. This proposal represents a significant step forward in the study of nautical charts, promising to deepen our knowledge of maritime navigation and cartographic evolution."
