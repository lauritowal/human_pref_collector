        " Title: A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service\n\nThis proposal aims to revolutionize city logistics by developing a novel measurement system centered on public value, incorporating multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. Our research will yield a new theory of city logistics, fostering efficiency gains in Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure and maximizing public value.\n\nWe will pursue three primary objectives: (1) Develop public value as a measurement system using multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization. (2) Establish principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design through network optimization. (3) Create a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures, introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization.\n\nOur research will have significant scientific and practical implications for transport and logistics, with far-reaching social, economic, and environmental consequences. By integrating public value into city logistics planning and management, we will promote sustainability and resilience in urban environments. Our proposed models and tools will enable stakeholders to design and manage LaaS infrastructure more effectively, fostering efficiency, and equity. Furthermore, our theoretical framework will advance understanding of logistics markets and optimization, contributing to the broader field of logistics and supply chain management."
