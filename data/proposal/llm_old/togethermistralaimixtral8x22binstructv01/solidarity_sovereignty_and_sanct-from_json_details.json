        " This grant proposal titled \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\" seeks to explore the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum via sea routes, with a focus on the influences of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary on their experiences and outcomes. The project will delve into the experiences of over a million boat refugees from various groups, including Jewish, Vietnamese, Cubans, and Haitians, who embarked on their journeys across different seas and decades, starting from the 1940s.\n\nThe central research question guiding this project is: \"How did notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space?\" Sub-questions, such as who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys and why, will also be explored. The project will investigate various aspects of these journeys, including solidarity onboard between boat refugees, encounters of solidarity from non-state actors, states' responses to boat refugees at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary after the journey.\n\nThe project is characterized by its unique perspectives, including thinking through seas, going beyond the state, and comparing across time and space. It will draw from a diverse range of sources, including interviews with boat refugees and state and non-state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage.\n\nThis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiences of boat refugees and the factors influencing their journeys and outcomes, contributing to the broader discourse on migration, human rights, and international relations. By examining the historical patterns of boat refugees, this project will shed light on the complex interplay of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping the experiences of those seeking asylum via sea routes."
