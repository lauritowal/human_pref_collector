        " The proposed project, \"Network Epistemology in Practice,\" falls within the research field of history and philosophy of science, with a focus on particle physics at CERN. The primary aim is to understand knowledge generation and validation within large scientific collaborations, with an emphasis on characterizing collective research processes through the analysis of internal communication. This project will utilize digital humanities tools to reconstruct internal communication from born-digital documents such as emails and internal wiki pages. The case study for this research is the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). The project's objectives include developing historiographic guidelines for future studies, contributing to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, and adapting theoretical models of network epistemology. The project will provide historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources and practical strategies for best practices in history and philosophy of science. It will also introduce methodological innovations, including the application of digital tools and computational methods. The project aims to address the challenge of capturing large-scale, complex research processes for epistemological analysis."
