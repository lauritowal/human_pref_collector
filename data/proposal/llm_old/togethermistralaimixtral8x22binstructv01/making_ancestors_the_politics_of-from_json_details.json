        " This proposal, titled \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe,\" aims to challenge traditional views and offer a new perspective on politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe. The research focuses on the empirical testing of a theory suggesting that inequality manifested situationally rather than overtly, utilizing methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy. The test sequence region for this project is Peninsular Italy, with key periods of focus including the Neolithic (6000-4000 BC), Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (4000-1800 BC), and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age (1800-600 BC).\n\nThe project will analyze 200 individuals per period to evaluate how inequality affected lives and understand the role of ancestors in these societies. The research goals are to test alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the socio-political dynamics of our ancestors. This project's findings will not only enrich our knowledge of prehistoric societies but also challenge existing narratives, paving the way for more inclusive and diverse interpretations of the past."
