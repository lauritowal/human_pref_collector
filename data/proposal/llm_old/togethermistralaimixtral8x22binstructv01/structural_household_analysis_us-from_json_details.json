        " This proposal, titled \"Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences,\" aims to develop a non-unitary model of households to better understand intrahousehold dynamics. By employing a nonparametric approach to the empirical analysis of household consumption, we seek to integrate marriage market dynamics into structural modeling and combine revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems. This research endeavors to open the \"black box\" of intrahousehold decision-making using aggregate consumption information, avoiding parametric assumptions on decision processes. Our objectives include describing the intrahousehold decision process and analyzing household consumption patterns. This project tackles the challenges of unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions. Pooled cross-section data sets will be utilized to achieve these goals, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of household behavior and decision-making processes."
