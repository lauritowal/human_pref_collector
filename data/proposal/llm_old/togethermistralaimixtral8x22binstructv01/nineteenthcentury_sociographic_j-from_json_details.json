        " This pioneering project, titled \"Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge,\" aims to delve into the uncharted territory of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism, establishing it as a cornerstone of social science development. The study will meticulously examine a diverse corpus of materials, including social sketches, travel accounts, philanthropic reports, and caricatures from Western Europe, German-speaking countries, and Latin America.\n\nAdopting a dual approach, combining anthropological and historiographical perspectives, the project will meticulously analyze the representational techniques of sociographic journalism. It will explore its connection to epistemic developments, embeddedness in socio-spatial settings, and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects. The study will also situate journalistic sketches against urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.\n\nThe project's anticipated outcomes include a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. These deliverables aim to foster a broader understanding of the role of journalism in shaping social science knowledge and its impact on society. Ultimately, this groundbreaking research project seeks to redefine our comprehension of the origins and evolution of ethnographic and sociological knowledge."
