        " The proposed research project, titled \"The advantages and pitfalls of elicitated online user engagement,\" aims to investigate the impact of user engagement elicited by calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. Utilizing an empirical approach that includes lab and field experiments, the primary objectives of this project are to understand user engagement and its elicitation, determine the direct value of user engagement for businesses, assess the societal implications of user engagement expectations, and characterize the effects of calls to action in multiple product domains. Preliminary results suggest that calls to action have strong effects on conversion and information revelation.\n\nThis project will be conducted in collaboration with a leading website-development service provider, which employs a freemium business model. The anticipated impact of this research includes contributing to the economic understanding of social computing and enhancing societal understanding of social computing. By isolating the underlying mechanisms of calls to action, this project aims to provide valuable insights for businesses seeking to optimize user engagement and improve conversion rates. Moreover, the societal implications of this research may inform policy and practice regarding online user engagement and its potential impacts on individuals and communities. Ultimately, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of online user engagement and its role in shaping the digital landscape."
