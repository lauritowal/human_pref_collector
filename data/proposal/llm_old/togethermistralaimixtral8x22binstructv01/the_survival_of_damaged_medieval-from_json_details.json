        " Title: The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\n\nThis proposal, named POLYCHROME, seeks to investigate the survival and transformation of painted, gilded, and wooden Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. The project aims to understand the factors contributing to the damage of these polychromed sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces, which have undergone a metamorphosis from devotional objects to cultural heritage. The research will focus on the risk assessment and preservation of these artifacts, challenging current assumptions that attribute damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism. We hypothesize that iconoclastic acts during the 16th-century break from the Roman Church, led by Gustav I in Sweden (1517) and Christian III in Denmark-Norway (1537), are linked to the observed damages.\n\nTo overcome the challenges of limited archival evidence and secondary paints masking information, we will employ technologies from the natural sciences. The objectives include conducting an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collecting information on their materials and restorations, and establishing a foundation for multidisciplinary studies. The expected outcomes of this research include a better understanding of the preserving effects of Lutheranism on these artifacts and influencing training priorities for future heritage assessment and care. Ultimately, this project aims to stimulate a debate about the values and future care of this invaluable cultural heritage."
