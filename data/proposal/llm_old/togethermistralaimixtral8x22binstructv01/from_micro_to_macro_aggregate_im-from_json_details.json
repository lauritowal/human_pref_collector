        " The proposed research project titled \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\" aims to address key questions in the realm of international trade, such as the determinants of trade patterns and their welfare effects, the potential divergence between individual and societal trade incentives, and the role of government intervention. Set against the backdrop of Europe, with its increasing protectionist pressures and nationalistic sentiments, this study seeks to re-evaluate conventional trade models in light of firm heterogeneity. The research will focus on four primary areas: market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities. The first work package will investigate the impact of allocative inefficiency due to firm heterogeneity and pricing distortions on a country's aggregate economic performance. The second will explore the theoretical implications of firm heterogeneity for trade policy, with an emphasis on cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements to maximize joint welfare. The third and fourth packages will study the interaction between country, sector, and firm characteristics in response to trade liberalization and investigate the role of firm heterogeneity in determining export abilities and shaping the productivity distribution of producers. The findings from this project will provide critical insights into the need to revisit traditional trade models and inform policy decisions to optimize international trade benefits."
