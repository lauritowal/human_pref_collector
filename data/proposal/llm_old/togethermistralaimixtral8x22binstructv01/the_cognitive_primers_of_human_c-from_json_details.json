        " The proposed project, \"The cognitive primers of human culture: a comparative approach to the emergence of innovations,\" aims to investigate the driving forces behind innovations across primates, with a focus on the significance of sharp stone tool (flake) creation and usage in human cultural development. This study will employ a triangulation approach, utilizing artificial intelligence coding methods to define baseline stone manipulation propensities in chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques.\n\nThe project objectives include testing the roles of exposure and experience as innovation drivers through an experimental paradigm with large sample sizes (N=350) and extended testing protocols (~4 years). By comparing primate assemblages to the oldest human stone tools, we aim to infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates. Structural Equation Models will be used to analyze the data.\n\nThe species studied, namely chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques, have been chosen for their known propensities towards tool use and manipulation. The study's duration is approximately four years, during which time we will collect and analyze data to enhance our understanding of the conditions required for innovations and the primers of human culture.\n\nThis research holds significant potential to advance our knowledge of the origins of human culture and the cognitive traits that distinguish us from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom. The findings could provide valuable insights into the development of cognitive capacities and the emergence of innovation, with implications for various fields, including anthropology, psychology, and primatology."
