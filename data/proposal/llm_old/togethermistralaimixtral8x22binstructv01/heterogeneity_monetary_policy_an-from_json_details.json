        " The proposed grant project, \"Heterogeneity, Monetary Policy and Economic Fluctuations,\" aims to assess the role of heterogeneity in economic fluctuations and study its implications for monetary policy. This research will focus on HANK (Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian) models to achieve these objectives.\n\nThe project will develop an organizing framework to distinguish 'unconstrained' versus 'constrained' agents and conduct a comparative analysis of HANK and TANK (Two Agent New Keynesian) models. The analysis will involve a study of heterogeneity wedge in consumption or investment, and understanding the channels of heterogeneity in HANK models and actual economies.\n\nComparatively, the project will focus on aggregate equilibrium dynamics, comparing HANK, TANK, and RANK (Representative Agent New Keynesian) models. The proposed applications of this research include understanding the role of constrained households in wage flexibility gains, the effects of helicopter drops on the economy, and the impact of heterogeneity on optimal monetary policy.\n\nOverall, the analysis of the heterogeneity wedge and its components should help understand the channels through which heterogeneity operates, contributing to improved monetary policy decisions and economic stability.\n\n---\n\nWord count: 145"
