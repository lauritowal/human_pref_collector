        " This proposal, titled \"Planning for Sustainable Ocean Use in Antarctica Under Global Environmental Change\" (PLAnT), aims to develop an integrated and sustainable marine spatial planning (MSP) framework for Antarctica, a region currently lacking any such development. Given the high urgency due to rapid changes in Antarctica, this project will critically focus on the impacts of climate change, which are essential for effective MSP. PLAnT's objectives include assessing social-ecological vulnerabilities, building future scenarios, supporting area-based climate action, providing dynamic solutions, conducting governance analyses, and fostering a paradigm shift towards sustainability and equity. However, contextual idiosyncrasies such as political, social, and economic factors pose significant challenges. The solution specificity risk is high, but the potential global impact is substantial. Successful implementation of this project could inspire nations worldwide to prioritize ocean sustainability, aligning with the high relevance to the international agenda. PLAnT seeks to pioneer a path towards sustainable ocean use in the face of global environmental change, setting a precedent for similar initiatives in other regions.\n\nWord count: 159"
