        " \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision\" (TIME) aims to revolutionize our understanding of human vision by examining it as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process. The project's interdisciplinary approach employs non-invasive human brain imaging, multivariate analysis techniques, and large-scale computational modeling to investigate vision in a more natural setting. By analyzing visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, TIME aims to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain. The development of novel multivariate analysis techniques and a bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision will facilitate the integration of information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process. The project's goals include a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision, providing new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions, and fostering closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision. Ultimately, TIME will contribute to our knowledge of the intricate interplay between the brain, behavior, and the environment, paving the way for advancements in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction."
