        " This grant proposal, titled \"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition,\" aims to advance our understanding of human cognition, with a focus on complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. The proposal consists of three interrelated strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental.\n\nIn the theoretical strand, the objective is to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that surpasses context-free complexity. The focus will be on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints, as current approaches are primarily confined to harmonic syntax and share the expressive power of tree-based context-free grammars.\n\nThe computational strand will compile and publish a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses. This will be implemented using a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars. The corpus will be used for training and evaluation purposes.\n\nThe experimental strand will test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, with a focus on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension.\n\nThis project will significantly contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences. By developing a more comprehensive understanding of musical syntax and its relationship to human cognition, we can gain insights into how we process and interpret complex auditory sequences. This knowledge can be applied to various domains, including music education, music therapy, and artificial intelligence."
