        " This proposal, \"The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship: A Cross-Species Comparison and Experimental Approach,\" seeks to elucidate the evolutionary origins of friendship and its implications on human health and well-being, public health, and political policy. The project aims to investigate the environmental forces driving variation in social bonds across species, with a focus on nonhuman primates, particularly macaques. Utilizing a cross-species dataset and social experiments, the study will test whether social isolation is a result of competitive exclusion.\n\nThe project also aims to establish whether the ability to gather information on the friendships of unrelated others is a uniquely human skill. This research is of paramount importance as social isolation has been linked to risks comparable to those faced by heavy smokers, drinkers, and the obese, including heightened susceptibility to heart disease.\n\nThe outcomes of this study will provide a deeper understanding of the evolutionary perspective of friendship, contributing to our comprehension of what it means to be human. This project will not only enrich our understanding of human specializations but also inform public health strategies and political policies, ultimately fostering healthier, more connected societies."
