        " This grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project titled \"Social politics in European borderlands: A comparative and transnational study, 1870s-1990s.\" The primary objective is to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by examining the roles of local actors in shaping social policies and welfare structures. The study will focus on three key border regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions, spanning from the 1870s to the 1990s.\n\nThe project will employ a comparative analysis and transnational frameworks to explore the co-construction of welfare and the interaction between public and private actors. Key concepts under investigation include local welfare structures, national and non-national identity, and solidarity. The anticipated outcomes of this research are a deeper understanding of inclusion and exclusion mechanisms in welfare provision, the dynamics of competition in social provision, and the circulation of ideas, people, and practices across borders.\n\nThe relevance of this study is threefold. Firstly, it offers a historical perspective on the role of local actors in welfare, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of European social politics. Secondly, it will inform contemporary debates on welfare reform by providing insights into the evolution of social care in Europe. Lastly, the project aims to address ongoing social rights issues in Europe, highlighting the importance of local actors and their contributions to social welfare."
