        " Ecologies of Violence: Crimes against Nature in the Contemporary Cultural Imagination is a pioneering research project aimed at developing an innovative ecological model for the study of violence and its representation. The project's objectives include documenting cultural expressions of ecoviolence, mapping its links to colonialism and genocide, and analyzing reflections on guilt, responsibility, and culture's implication in violence. The project will explore how representations harness affect and emotion for environmental crisis relation and critical self-reflection, ultimately reorienting cultural memory research and ecocriticism to consider more-than-human terms.\n\nThe proposed methodology comprises a comparative study, transnational analysis, and the integration of cultural memory studies and ecocriticism. The project will produce a comprehensive study of environmental violence in culture and a best practices guide for pedagogy engagement with cultural representations of ecoviolence.\n\nThe themes of this project encompass environmental violence, cultural memory, ecocriticism, representation of violence, and critical literacies about ecoviolence. The project, titled EcoViolence, will provide a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms, thereby contributing significantly to the discourse on environmental ethics and cultural memory. The proposed project will not only enhance our understanding of the representation of violence in cultural expressions but also provide practical guidelines for pedagogy engagement with these representations."
