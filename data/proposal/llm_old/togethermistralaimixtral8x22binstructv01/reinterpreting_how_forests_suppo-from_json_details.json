        " This proposal, titled \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries,\" aims to address the global issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting over 2 billion people. Traditionally, solutions have focused on increasing agricultural production and access to calories, overlooking the role of forests. This project aims to shift the paradigm by exploring the benefits of forests, such as wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock that contribute to dietary diversification.\n\nThe project's multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich approach will identify forest loss and fragmentation effects on dietary quality, develop a framework on forest-diet linkages, and provide empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary outcomes. The methodology includes a broad-scale perspective to explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes; hotspots identification by linking household food consumption data with forest metrics; and in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes.\n\nThe project will be conducted in two fieldwork locations, with the ultimate outcome being a shift in food security conceptualization. By recognizing forests' role in providing essential nutrients through wild foods, high-value products, and livestock products like meat, milk, eggs, and manure, this project aims to contribute to global efforts in combating nutrient deficiencies in low-income countries."
