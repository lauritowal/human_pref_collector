        " In this comparative and longitudinal research project titled \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time,\" we explore the delegation of authority to international organizations (IOs) and their subsequent empowerment from 1986 to 2010. With a focus on the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO, the study examines varied examples of IOs that have experienced a steady extension of power, such as the EU and IMF, and those with constant authority, like the GATT/WTO-Secretariat and NATO.\n\nOur research design integrates disciplinary approaches from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology to analyze factors influencing IO empowerment, including temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design. By employing a combination of qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials, we aim to develop a comprehensive model of power delegation to IOs that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach.\n\nThis project is both theory-building and hypothesis-testing in nature, with the primary objective of providing insights into the consequences of power delegation and advancing theoretical and empirical International Relations research. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that underlie the delegation of power to international organizations and their evolving roles in global governance."
