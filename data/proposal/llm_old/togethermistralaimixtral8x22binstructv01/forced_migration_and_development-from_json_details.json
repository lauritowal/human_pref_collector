        " Title: Forced Migration and Development\n\nThis proposal aims to address the global forced migration crisis, in which 68.5 million individuals have been displaced, with 85% hosted by developing countries. The project, FORCEDMIGDEV, will analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in developing nations, focusing on refugee inflows and climate shocks on internal displacement.\n\nIn the first part of the project, we will investigate the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks across regions, using a structural model to estimate the economic impact of refugee inflows. A case study on Syrian refugees in Turkey will be conducted to examine the effects of legal status for refugees.\n\nThe second part of the project will explore the intersection of climate and development economics, specifically assessing the long-run effects of internal displacement due to climate shocks. We will combine reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the reduced-form effects in Brazil, and develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the long-term consequences of internal displacement.\n\nThrough this project, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, and to inform policy decisions that can mitigate the negative impacts and promote sustainable development. By addressing critical questions regarding the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks and the long-term consequences of climate-induced displacement, FORCEDMIGDEV will contribute to a more equitable and resilient future for both displaced individuals and host communities."
