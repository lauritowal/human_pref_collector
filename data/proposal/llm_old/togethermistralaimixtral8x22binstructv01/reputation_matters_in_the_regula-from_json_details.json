        " The proposed project, \"Reputation Matters in the Regulatory State: Re-thinking the Fundamentals of Regulatory Independence, Credibility and Accountability\" (RICA), aims to challenge and reconceptualize the assumptions underpinning the regulatory state. The project will address key challenges, including rethinking normative and institutional design principles, addressing the rise of non-majoritarianism, dealing with the devaluation of political process, and evaluating the relationship between accountability and autonomy.\n\nRICA is structured into two modules. The first module focuses on the relationship between agency insulation and credibility, with an expected outcome that insulation negatively affects credibility. The second module delves into understanding accountability and the development of a new theory, exploring how reputation shapes accountability behavior.\n\nThe project will engage with key concepts such as regulatory independence, regulatory credibility, accountability, and autonomy, drawing insights from political science literature on reputation. RICA questions established wisdom and proposes new theoretical frameworks regarding regulatory independence, credibility, and accountability. This innovative approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the regulatory state and its complex dynamics."
