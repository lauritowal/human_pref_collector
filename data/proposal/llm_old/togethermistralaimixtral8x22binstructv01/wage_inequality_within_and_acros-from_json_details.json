        " This grant proposal, titled \"Wage inequality within and across firms: The role of market forces, government and firm policies,\" aims to comprehensively examine the escalating wage inequality in industrialized countries over the past decades. The research will primarily focus on the increase in wage inequality between firms and the persistent gender gaps, particularly influenced by the arrival of children. Leveraging extensive data sources such as German social security records, survey data, and administrative data spanning four decades, this project will delve into the intricacies of wage disparities.\n\nThe research is structured into three distinct projects. Project A will scrutinize the influence of market forces, including product market competition and routine-biased technological change, on wage inequality through their effects on selection, reallocation, and differential wage growth. Project B will investigate the impact of government policies, such as the introduction of minimum wage and business tax rate changes, on wage inequality, focusing on their effects on selection, reallocation, and differential growth. Lastly, Project C will explore the role of firm policies, including family-friendly policies, flexible working times, and child care facilities, in shaping mothers’ return-to-work decisions and earnings trajectories after childbirth. This project will also consider the firm environment factors such as the presence of co-workers with working mothers and egalitarian gender attitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to wage inequality, with a particular emphasis on gender inequality, and the role of market forces, government policies, and firm policies in shaping these disparities."
