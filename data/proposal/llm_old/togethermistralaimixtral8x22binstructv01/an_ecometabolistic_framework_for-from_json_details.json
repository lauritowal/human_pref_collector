        " In response to the global crisis of material depletion, the proposed interdisciplinary project, \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture,\" aims to facilitate architecture's transition to bio-based materials. This project addresses key challenges such as representation, conceptualization, operationalization, and material lifespan conception, while rethinking architecture's fundamental value proposition. Adopting an eco-metabolistic framework, the project's objectives are to deliver carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions.\n\nThe research-by-design methodology will investigate materials like glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. Utilizing computational modelling networks such as predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing, the project will establish a design agency concept centered on continual construction beyond building completion.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include participatory practices, sustainable practice, socially conscious models of production, and democratic models of production. By challenging traditional design agency, this project proposes new practices to harness the short lifespans of bio-based materials for sustainable architecture, ultimately contributing to a more environmentally responsible and socially conscious built environment."
