        " The Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period (GLOBECOSAL) is a research project aiming to globalize the history of early modern art and challenge perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. Focusing on artworks and the negotiation of sanctity in the post-Tridentine era, this project investigates how art was used to negotiate spiritual status within Catholic communities during the period of Iberian hegemony.\n\nThe research will center on the production of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, exploring their role in self-representation, social identity formation, and the affirmation of societies producing saints. By tracing the circulation of material objects, iconographies, and global networks of knowledge transmission, this project will shed light on local constructions of sanctity in the Iberian empires, which have been largely neglected in previous studies.\n\nThe theoretical framework of a global market of symbolic values, combined with critical sociology, will guide the examination of the adherence to Tridentine models of sanctity and the broader conflict between the Catholic Church and Protestants. This interdisciplinary approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between art, religion, and society in the early modern period.\n\nThe findings of this project will not only enrich our knowledge of art history but also offer new insights into the socio-political dynamics of the early modern world. Ultimately, GLOBECOSAL aspires to challenge and expand existing narratives surrounding Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the global context of the post-Tridentine era."
