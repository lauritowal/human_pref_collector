    "descriptions": [
        " The proposed project, \"REFORMED: Reforming Schools Globally,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive, multi-scalar analysis of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies in the education sector. Recognizing global reform pressures, the project focuses on the policy areas of school autonomy and accountability, addressing their dissemination, convergence, contextual circumstances, and effects on learning outcomes and equity. These policies have been adopted across a range of countries, administrative traditions, and levels of development, with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) playing a significant role in their promotion.\n\nThe research approach is designed to be robust and combines quantitative and qualitative methods. It will investigate the inception of SAWA policies in global agendas, their operationalization, and their effects in multiple contexts. The project will delve into institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes, involving actors such as international bureaucrats and teachers. A key focus will be the examination of policy effects at the school level.\n\nThe project seeks to address existing research gaps, characterized by inconclusive and mixed findings, through a rigorous methodological strategy. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of SAWA policies' adoption, reformulation, and effects, contributing to the global discourse on education reform and policy convergence.\n\nIn conclusion, \"REFORMED\" offers a unique opportunity to advance our knowledge of SAWA policies and their impact on education systems worldwide. It promises to yield insights that can inform policy design and implementation, ultimately contributing to improved learning outcomes and equity in education."
