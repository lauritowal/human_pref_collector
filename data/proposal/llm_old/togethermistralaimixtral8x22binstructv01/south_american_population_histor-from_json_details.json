        " This grant proposal, titled \"South American population history revisited: multidisciplinary perspectives on the Upper Amazon,\" aims to elucidate the evolution of linguistic diversity in the western South American region of the Upper Amazon. This area is known for its rich sociohistorical layers of continental population history and is of significant interest due to its extremely diverse linguistic landscape.\n\nThe project will focus on reconstructing and comparing geographical, socio-historical, and communicative layers of history using a multidisciplinary approach. This methodology will allow for the examination of patterns and processes that have shaped linguistic diversity in the region, potentially revealing past events such as migrations, language shifts, exogamy, and trade.\n\nThe Upper Amazon can be divided into three linguistic zones: the north and south, which are extremely diverse with signs of local language contact, representing old diversity patterns; and the central region, dominated by three language families indicating different stages of expansion into the area. By investigating these zones, the project aims to provide insights into the interaction between ecology, human behavior, and human cognition.\n\nThe research will not only shed light on the social dynamics that have shaped linguistic diversity but also use this diversity as a window into our past. The potential findings, such as migrations and language shifts, can contribute to a better understanding of human history and the complexities of human interaction. We invite your support for this ambitious project that promises to advance our knowledge of human history and culture."
