        " The proposed project, \"Enslaved Persons in the Making of Societies and Cultures in Western Eurasia and Africa, 1000 BCE - 300 CE,\" seeks to investigate the profound impact of slave agency on ancient societies and cultures. This extensive research initiative, titled SLaVEgents, spans a vast historical period from 1000 BCE to 300 CE and covers geographical areas in Western Eurasia and North Africa. The project will delve into languages as diverse as Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, providing a comprehensive view of the historical narrative.\n\nThe research team comprises a principal investigator, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers, and three PhD candidates. This multi-disciplinary team will produce a wide array of research outputs, including a digital prosopography, a monograph, two collective volumes, fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, an international conference, and a dedicated website.\n\nThe project's primary focus is to analyze the role of enslaved persons in shaping ancient societies and cultures. It will consider their multiple identities, communities, and networks, and the significant historical changes they influenced. This research aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the past by highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of enslaved individuals. The project's findings will not only enrich our historical knowledge but also foster a broader appreciation for the complexities of human societies and the enduring impact of individual agency, even in the face of extreme adversity."
