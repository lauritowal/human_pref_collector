        " Title: The Evolutionary Landscape of Modern Human Origins in Africa\n\nThis proposal, titled \"NGIPALAJEM,\" seeks to investigate the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas, focusing on the Middle Pleistocene period, approximately 750,000 years ago. The research aims to establish major empirical benchmarks to answer significant questions about human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape.\n\nThe project will concentrate on the Turkana region for fieldwork, with the goals of adding specimens to the hominin fossil record and increasing the large vertebrate fossil record. The fieldwork will be complemented by inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative analyses, using novel morphometric and analytical techniques.\n\nThe research will be situated within the context of the Environmental and Mammalian Paleobiological Transition (EMPT), a period of significant climatic variability and prolonged arid phase that lasted for approximately 1 million years, starting from 1.4 million years ago. This transition is marked by changes in the large mammal community, particularly towards the end of the EMPT.\n\nThe project will explore the phenotypic diversity within the last million years of the fossil record, with a particular focus on the new discovery of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. The expected outcomes of this research include a new understanding of human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape, contributing to the broader field of Homo sapiens origins in Africa."
