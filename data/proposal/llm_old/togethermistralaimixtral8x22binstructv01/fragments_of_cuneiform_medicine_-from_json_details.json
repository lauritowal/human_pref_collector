        " This grant proposal, titled \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity,\" aims to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform, known as BabMed. The study will focus on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as it appears in the Babylonian Talmud, written in Aramaic. It hypothesizes that cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. The methodology relies upon native taxonomies and will compare Babylonian medicine with neighboring medical systems, challenging the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories. Utilizing a new paradigm for knowledge transfer, this study will explore how Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud. The unique text of the Babylonian Talmud, set in the geographical context of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia, mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds. BabMed represents the largest ancient collection of medical data before Hippocrates, offering a fresh perspective on the history of medicine and knowledge transfer."
