        " In our proposal titled \"Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols,\" we aim to elucidate the unique characteristics of human cerebral architecture that facilitate learning in infants within the domains of language and complex social interactions. Our study will span from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life, utilizing a range of techniques including EEG, MRI, and optical topography.\n\nOur project is divided into six work packages, each focusing on a distinct aspect of infant learning. Work package 1 will investigate age-related statistical inferences using hierarchical auditory oddball paradigms, while work package 2 will explore the effects of different pre-term environments on early statistical computations. Work package 3 will delve into the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, and work package 4 will establish criteria for infant symbolic competency. Work packages 5 and 6 will focus on functional localization and maturational markers using MRI, and the development of new tools for multimodal brain image analysis, respectively.\n\nOur primary objective is to clarify the specificities of a neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits. By understanding these mechanisms, we hope to shed light on the development of the infant brain, particularly in relation to language and complex social interactions. This knowledge could potentially inform early interventions and educational strategies for infants, as well as contribute to our broader understanding of human cognition."
