        " This proposal, titled \"Implications of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Psychosocial Functioning and Social Relationships‚Å† of Transgender People,\" aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between hormone therapy and psychosocial functioning, as well as social relationships, in the transgender population. The project will employ a biopsychosocial model, utilizing a variety of novel and cutting-edge research methods across four work packages.\n\nThe primary objectives are to identify the causal pathways linking gender-affirming hormone therapy to psychosocial functioning, empower transgender individuals to voice their personal and relational experiences, and guide policy and practice for gender identity services. With informed consent as a cornerstone, this research will focus on improving psychosocial functioning and social relationship outcomes, thereby addressing the high rates of social disruption and suicide risk prevalent within this community.\n\nThe proposed research will position itself at the forefront of gender-affirming healthcare, contributing significantly to the field of transgender health. By addressing key concerns related to psychosocial functioning and social relationship experiences, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implications of hormone therapy, ultimately improving the overall well-being and social integration of transgender individuals."
