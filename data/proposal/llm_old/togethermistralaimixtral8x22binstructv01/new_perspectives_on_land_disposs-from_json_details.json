        " This grant proposal aims to explore the multifaceted issue of land dispossession in the West African Sahel, with a particular focus on Mali. Titled \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel,\" this project seeks to understand the complex relationship between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration, particularly among farmers and pastoralists who constitute our primary target groups.\n\nOur central hypothesis posits that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, with the latter being linked to the rise of 'jihadist' groups. Through a mixed-methods approach, we aim to investigate the underlying motivations and mechanisms driving these phenomena, employing theoretical frameworks from political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies.\n\nThe project's objectives include a thorough investigation of the link between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration, as well as an assessment of why some smallholders resort to violent resistance while others remain compliant. We anticipate that our research will yield novel insights about smallholder motivations and agency, contribute new knowledge to the discourse on interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and provide valuable ideas for policy formulation.\n\nIn essence, this project will delve into the hypothesized relationship between land dispossession, elite capture, violent jihadist resistance, and migration, offering a comprehensive analysis that can inform more effective and equitable land governance policies in the region."
