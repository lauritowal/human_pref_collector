        " Title: Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators\n\nThis proposal, \"Navigating the Marketplace of Indicators,\" aims to address the complexity arising from the abundance of Country Performance Indicators (CPIs) within policy fields such as education, global governance, climate policy, and pandemic preparedness. The paradox of CPIs simplifying issues individually but complicating them collectively when multiple indicators are utilized has led to a significant research gap in effectively navigating policy fields with numerous CPIs.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the adaptation over time of CPI users and producers in the face of this complexity. Drawing inspiration from the \"marketplace of ideas\" concept, we propose a systemic, longitudinal analysis of CPI users and producers, focusing on their learning processes from CPI criticism and decision-making with diverse CPIs, as well as the competitive dynamics within crowded policy fields.\n\nBy adopting this approach, we aim to advance CPI research by systematically shifting the focus towards the problem of managing multiple indicators. This research will not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of CPI usage and production but also provide practical insights for policymakers and stakeholders in effectively navigating the marketplace of indicators.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making processes and improve policy outcomes by facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the collective impact of CPIs. This research will be of significant value to various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and international organizations, who are grappling with the challenge of managing multiple CPIs in their respective fields."
