        " Our grant proposal, titled \"Economic Fluctuations, Productivity Growth and Stabilization Policies: A Keynesian Growth Perspective,\" aims to develop a Keynesian growth framework that unifies the study of business cycles and growth. This innovative approach combines Keynesian aggregate demand fluctuations with endogenous growth theory on productivity, culminating in a state-of-the-art Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms.\n\nThe proposed project, divided into three parts, will first focus on developing a novel Keynesian growth model with advanced quantitative endogenous growth features. The second part will involve creating an open economy Keynesian growth model to explore the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth. The third part will entail empirical testing of productivity growth responses to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions.\n\nTo better understand the practical implications of our research, we will conduct case studies on the Euro inception effects and the empirical response estimation in the United States and a panel of advanced economies. These case studies will help us understand the increase in capital flows and stagnant productivity growth in recipient countries and estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to various policy interventions.\n\nThrough this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of monetary and fiscal policy impacts on productivity growth and investigate stagnation due to pessimistic expectations, particularly during large recessions like the Great Recession. By integrating Keynesian and endogenous growth theories, we hope to provide valuable insights for policymakers and contribute to the broader discussion on economic stabilization policies."
