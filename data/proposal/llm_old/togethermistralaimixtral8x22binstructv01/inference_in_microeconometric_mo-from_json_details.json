        " This grant proposal, titled \"Inference in Microeconometric Models,\" aims to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting longitudinal data. The project is divided into three main blocks, each focusing on a specific area of microeconometrics.\n\nBlock 1 concentrates on inference on nonlinear models, aiming to enhance the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. This advancement will enable more accurate and reliable inference in complex microeconomic models, contributing to improved decision-making processes.\n\nBlock 2 focuses on the estimation of models for network data. The project aims to provide formal results using network data as panel data. This will not only broaden the scope of available data but also significantly improve the accuracy and precision of economic models.\n\nBlock 3 is dedicated to the non-parametric estimation of dynamic discrete-choice models. The project seeks to address unobserved type heterogeneity and latent state variables. This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of economic behavior, considering the often overlooked unobserved differences between economic agents.\n\nThe proposed methods have wide-ranging applications, including labor force participation and the import and export behavior of firms and countries. The project will employ theoretical and simulation assessments to ensure the validity and reliability of the proposed methods. Ultimately, this project aims to shed light on how unobserved differences between economic agents drive differences in economic outcomes such as schooling decisions, wages, and employment durations."
