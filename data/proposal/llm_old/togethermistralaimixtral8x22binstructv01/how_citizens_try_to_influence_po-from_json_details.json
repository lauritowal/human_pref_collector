        " This grant proposal, titled \"How citizens try to influence politics and why: International comparisons of movement and party politics,\" aims to elucidate political participation dynamics in democratic societies. By examining contentious and non-contentious politics within a unified theoretical and methodological framework, the project seeks to understand individual political engagement or apathy, investigate the causes of different modes of political participation, and explore the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal dynamics. The study will be conducted in eight countries—The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina—providing a diverse and comprehensive pool for analysis.\n\nThe project comprises four subprojects: 1) A meta-analysis of publications on movement and party politics combined, 2) Comparisons of political participation over time and countries in existing global survey data, 3) Focus group discussions to understand the formation of political engagement and disengagement, and 4) Experimental focused surveys among 1,000 respondents to quantify patterns of political participation. The meta-analysis and survey comparisons will offer a broad perspective, while focus groups and experimental surveys will provide in-depth insights into individual and collective political behaviors.\n\nThis project's international scope and multi-method approach will contribute significantly to the understanding of political participation in democratic societies. The findings will inform policymakers, scholars, and the public, ultimately enhancing democratic processes and encouraging active citizenship."
