        " The proposed research project, \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine and Policing,\" aims to explore the profound implications of the transition from traditional probabilistic prediction to advanced algorithmic forecasting methods in key social institutions. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging the social sciences with the domains of insurance, medicine, and policing.\n\nThe primary focus areas of this research include Big Data, Machine Learning, digital forecasting, uncertainty management, probability calculus, and algorithmic prediction. The research will delve into the challenges posed by this transition, including the individualization of prediction, the undermining of the mutualization principle, the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods, the problem of bias, and the distinction between prevention and repression.\n\nThe research will concentrate on three critical areas: personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing. These areas have been chosen due to their significant societal impact and their potential to illustrate the broader implications of algorithmic prediction.\n\nThe overarching goal of this research is to investigate the social consequences of this shift towards algorithmic forecasting. It will provide valuable insights into how these advanced prediction methods are reshaping our social institutions and what challenges and opportunities they present for the future. This research is poised to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge on the social implications of advanced prediction methods and their role in shaping our society."
