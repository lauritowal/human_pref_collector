        "The proposed project, \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials,\" aims to investigate the gendered nature of collective bargaining in the metal and nursing sectors in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. With global and European average gender pay gaps standing at 20% and 13% respectively, this project, named WAGE, seeks to address the disparities in wage formation between genders.\n\nUsing ethnographic research methods, the project will compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap in the selected countries. It will also uncover and analyze the daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that lead to wage increases in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. Furthermore, the project will document and explain how actors within these sectors relate to wage norms and gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy shedding light on the mechanisms that perpetuate gendered wage differentials within specific sectors, this research has the potential to inform policy interventions aimed at reducing the gender pay gap. Ultimately, through a deep dive into the intricacies of sectoral wage formation, the project seeks to contribute to a more equitable and just labor market for all individuals, irrespective of their gender.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials,\" aims to investigate the gendered nature of collective bargaining in the metal and nursing sectors in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. With the global average gender pay gap at 20% and the European average at 13%, there is a pressing need to understand the factors contributing to these disparities. By utilizing ethnographic research methods, this project, named WAGE, seeks to achieve three main research objectives.\n\nFirst, the project will compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap in the selected countries. Second, it will uncover and analyze the daily practices within collective bargaining rounds that lead to wage increases in the male-dominated metal sector and the female-dominated nursing sector. Finally, the project aims to document and explain how individuals within these sectors perceive and navigate sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy shedding light on the intricacies of sectoral wage formation and gendered wage differentials, this project has the potential to inform policies and practices that promote greater pay equity and address systemic gender disparities in the workforce. Through a rigorous examination of the interplay between collective bargaining and gendered wage differentials, WAGE seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of gender studies and labor economics.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Egalitarian but not Equal: Sectoral Wage Formation and Gendered Wage Differentials,\" seeks to address the pervasive issue of gender pay gaps in the labor market. With a global average gender pay gap of 20% and a European average of 13%, the project aims to theorize the gendered nature of collective bargaining, specifically focusing on the metal and nursing sectors in Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Using ethnographic research methods, the project will compare and synthesize existing histories of collective bargaining and gender pay gaps in these countries, as well as uncover and analyze the daily practices in bargaining rounds that lead to wage disparities in male-dominated and female-dominated sectors.\n\nBy documenting and explaining how actors in the metal and nursing sectors relate to wage norms and gendered wage differentials, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that perpetuate unequal pay. The research objectives include examining the factors contributing to sectoral wage discrepancies and identifying potential areas for intervention to address these disparities. Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute to the development of policies and practices that promote gender equality in the labor market, ultimately working towards a more equitable and just society."
