        "The proposed project, titled \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea,\" seeks to examine the complex dynamics of fisher movements and shifting practices in the South China Sea region. The project will involve multiple countries, including China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania, and will focus on challenging assumptions about fishers as mere instruments of state agendas. \n\nUtilizing concepts such as radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and thalassographic analysis, the project will categorize fishers into different groups such as fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers. The methodology will involve a theoretical and methodological framework, along with fine-grained ethnography of study groups such as Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers.\n\nThe key nodal point of the study will be shore-based activities, with a specific focus on the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. The research aims to provide both scientific and policy value, ultimately contributing to a novel understanding of fishers as mobile maritime actors. \"TransOcean\" represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a unique perspective on the complexities of transoceanic fisher movements.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea,\" aims to investigate the complex dynamics of fisher movements and practices in the South China Sea region involving countries such as China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. The project focuses on the shift in fishing practices, transoceanic expansion, and various fisher categories including poachers, traders, and smugglers. By challenging the assumption of fishers as instruments of state agendas, the study will utilize radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and fine-grained ethnography to understand the relational and shifting multiple mobilities of Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers. The research will also explore key nodal points such as shore-based activities and address the growing market demand for illicit seafood between China and Vietnam. By developing a novel theoretical and methodological framework, the project aims to provide scientific and policy value in understanding fishers as mobile maritime actors. The proposed study, TransOcean, seeks to contribute significantly to the field of marine studies and highlight the importance of studying the complexities of fisher movements in the South China Sea.",
        "The proposed project, \"Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea,\" aims to investigate the shifting dynamics of fishing practices and transoceanic expansion among fishers in China, Vietnam, African countries, and Oceania. The project challenges assumptions of fishers as mere instruments of state agendas by exploring radical marine harvesting techniques, transoceanic networks, and relational mobilities through a thalassographic analysis. The study will focus on fisher categories including fishers, poachers, traders, and smugglers, utilizing a theoretical and methodological framework alongside fine-grained ethnography. Key nodal points such as shore-based activities will be examined, with a particular emphasis on the growing Sino-Vietnamese demand for illicit seafood. By studying Vietnamese, Chinese, African, and Pacific fishers, the project aims to contribute to both scientific and policy values, offering insights into the complexities of fisher movements and their impact on global maritime economies. \"TransOcean\" seeks to establish a new understanding of fishers as mobile maritime actors through its innovative approach, making a significant contribution to the field of marine studies."
