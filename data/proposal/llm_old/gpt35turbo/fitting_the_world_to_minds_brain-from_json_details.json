        "The \"Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World\" grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive neurocognitive model that elucidates how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The project addresses the challenges posed by conceptual and technical limitations in studying social information representation, as well as the use of simplistic social stimuli in experiments. Leveraging recent advances in brain signal analysis, the proposal adopts a novel approach by studying social interaction in naturalistic settings and measuring temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals. The project utilizes innovative signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition to test hypotheses on selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction, association between cognitive task sets and synchronous brain activity, and the impact of intense emotional experiences on brain responses and information flow. The outcomes of this research are expected to enhance the understanding of brain dynamics in social interaction and potentially lead to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. This project represents a unique \"Naturalistic neuroscience approach\" that has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge in this field.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World,\" aims to build a comprehensive neurocognitive model to understand how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The project will address the challenges of studying social information representation by utilizing recent advances in brain signal analysis. By studying social interaction in naturalistic settings and measuring the temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals, the project will test hypotheses related to selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction, similarities in cognitive task sets, and the impact of intense emotional experiences on brain responses. Through the use of novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition, the project seeks to improve our understanding of brain dynamics in social interaction. The ultimate goal is to potentially contribute to a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. The proposed project represents a novel approach in naturalistic neuroscience that has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how individuals share and transmit representations of the social world.",
        "The proposed project, \"Fitting The World to Minds: Brain Basis of Sharing and Transmitting Representations of the Social World,\" aims to construct a comprehensive neurocognitive model elucidating how individuals maintain and convey shared neural representations of the dynamic social environment. This endeavor addresses the conceptual and technical challenges inherent in studying social information representation, particularly given the limitations of current experimental paradigms that often utilize simplistic social stimuli. Leveraging recent advancements in brain signal analysis, the project adopts a novel approach by examining social interactions in naturalistic settings and measuring the temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals.\n\nThrough a combination of novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques, and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition, the project seeks to test hypotheses regarding selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction, the association between cognitive task similarities and synchronous brain activity, and the impact of intense emotional experiences on brain response synchronization and information flow. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain dynamics underlying social interactions, with implications for a paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience. This naturalistic neuroscience approach holds promise for advancing our knowledge of how individuals share and transmit representations of the social world."
