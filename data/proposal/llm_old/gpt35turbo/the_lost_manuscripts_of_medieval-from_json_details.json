        "The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts (LostMa) aims to delve into the intricate process of how human cultures evolve through the transmission of written artifacts. By focusing on chivalric literature in the European context, this project seeks to shed light on the role of chance in the preservation or loss of written artifacts, as well as the ways manuscript texts were copied, transformed, or even destroyed over time. \n\nUtilizing a multidisciplinary approach, LostMa will combine artificial intelligence with complexity science and philological expertise to analyze approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, among a total of 4000 documents. By employing methods such as stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection, this project aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms that shape the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons.\n\nThe findings from this research will not only contribute to our understanding of cultural transmission but also provide insights into the broader processes of innovation, fixation, and extinction within human societies. By treating the transmission of texts as a dynamic process akin to the evolution of organisms or language variants, LostMa seeks to advance our knowledge of how humans have shaped and reshaped their cultural heritage through the ages.",
        "The grant proposal \"The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts\" (LostMa) aims to delve into the intricate web of cultural evolution through the transmission of written artefacts. The project seeks to shed light on the role of chance in the preservation or loss of texts, the mechanisms behind manuscript copying and transformation, and the impact of human agency on cultural transmission.\n\nUtilizing a multidisciplinary approach, LostMa will employ a combination of artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise to analyze approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, with a total of 4000 documents in the study. By integrating stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning techniques for large-scale data collection, the project will unravel the intricate patterns of text survival and the formation of cultural canons.\n\nFocused on chivalric literature in a European context, LostMa aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how manuscripts were transmitted, transformed, or lost over time. By viewing the transmission of texts as a process akin to the evolution of organisms or language variants, LostMa will contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of cultural evolution and the role of written artefacts in shaping human cultures.\n\nThrough its innovative methods and rigorous analysis, LostMa promises to enrich our understanding of the intricate processes underlying the transmission of texts and the formation of cultural canons in medieval Europe and beyond.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"The Lost Manuscripts of Medieval Europe: Modelling the Transmission of Texts\" (LostMa), aims to shed light on the intricate process of cultural evolution through the transmission of written artefacts. The project seeks to unravel the mysteries surrounding the preservation or loss of manuscript texts, the dynamics of copying and transformation, and the influence of human agency on cultural transmission.\n\nThe objectives of the project include understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of human cultures, exploring the role of chance in the survival of texts, and investigating how manuscript texts were copied, transformed, or destroyed. Through a combination of artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological expertise, the project will analyze approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts, focusing on chivalric literature within a European context.\n\nBy employing cutting-edge methods such as stochastic birth-and-death processes, computer multi-agent simulations, and deep learning for large-scale data collection, the project aims to create a comprehensive model of text transmission that parallels the evolution of organisms or language variants. With a total of 4000 documents in languages including Romance, Germanic, and Celtic, LostMa will contribute valuable insights into the survival of texts and the formation of cultural canons.\n\nOverall, LostMa represents a groundbreaking effort to unravel the complexities of cultural transmission and shed light on the enduring legacy of medieval manuscript texts."
