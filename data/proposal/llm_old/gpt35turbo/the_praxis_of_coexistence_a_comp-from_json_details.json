        "The grant proposal, titled \"The Praxis of Coexistence: A Comparative and Inductive Approach to the Challenges of Diversity,\" seeks to address the issue of ethno-religious coexistence through a new empirical, inductive, and comparative research program. The project will focus on how coexistence is practiced in diverse communities in Europe, the United States, India, and Israel.\n\nThe objectives of the research program include understanding spontaneous coexistence practices, achieving better policy through empirical study, enlightening about community expectations for coexistence, and exploring resources used to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict. The approach will be comparative and inductive, with a focus on ordinary coexistence in the context of religious and ethnic diversity.\n\nThe goals of the project are to open theoretical and normative space for diverse approaches to coexistence and to take culture and existing practices into account for diversity dilemmas. Key research questions include how communities accommodate difference spontaneously and what resources they draw on to maintain civil relations and avoid conflict.\n\nThis grant proposal aims to contribute valuable insights and recommendations for promoting and enhancing ethno-religious coexistence in diverse communities around the world.",
