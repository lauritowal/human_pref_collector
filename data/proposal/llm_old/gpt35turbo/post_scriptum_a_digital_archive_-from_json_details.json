        "The \"Post Scriptum: A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern Portugal and Spain)\" grant proposal aims to create a comprehensive digital archive of personal letters from the 17th to early 19th centuries in Portugal and Spain. This project will focus on letters written by a diverse group of authors, including servants, children, wives, lovers, thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, and political fighters. Through systematic collection, edition, and historical-linguistic study, the project will provide a well-contextualized examination of inter-personal modes of relation in traditional communities. The research will also involve sociological interviews to supplement the primary sources. The project output will include a large collection assembly, online digital edition, philological treatment, and cultural and linguistic study, all held to the highest editing standards of Textual Criticism. By delving into the oral rhetoric, expression of emotions, commonsense statements, confession of non-orthodox beliefs, and narration of trivial incidents found in these ordinary writings, this project seeks to shed light on the everyday lives and beliefs of individuals in early modern Portugal and Spain.",
