        "The project \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes\" aims to address the fundamental issue of distinguishing between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. Using a combination of behavioral and brain imaging methods, the project will focus on three key tracks: unconscious perception utilizing Gaze-Contingent Substitution for subliminal stimuli presentation, conscious perception through a Bayesian framework for perceptual content reconstruction, and the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures and high-density EEG.\n\nThe expected impact of this project includes uncovering sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, specifying the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and providing new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. By utilizing cutting-edge techniques and focusing on various aspects of conscious and unconscious processes, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the human mind. The findings from this research have the potential to inform future studies in psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, ultimately advancing our knowledge of how consciousness evolves and functions.",
        "The proposed project, \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes,\" aims to address the fundamental issue of distinguishing between conscious and unconscious processes in the human mind. Utilizing behavioral and brain imaging methods, the project will explore three distinct tracks: unconscious perception through Gaze-Contingent Substitution, conscious perception using a Bayesian framework for reconstructing perceptual contents, and the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants through psychophysical measures and high-density EEG.\n\nThe project's expected impacts include providing evidence of sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences, specifying the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions, and offering new insights into the development of consciousness in humans. By combining innovative methodologies and cutting-edge techniques, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of how consciousness emerges and evolves in the human brain. Ultimately, the findings from this study have the potential to inform future research on cognitive processes and contribute to interdisciplinary efforts in neuroscience and psychology.",
        "The proposed project, \"A Dynamic View on Conscious and Unconscious Processes,\" aims to delve into the intricate distinction between conscious and unconscious processes, a pivotal aspect in unraveling the complexities of the human mind. Through the utilization of behavioral and brain imaging methodologies, the project intends to explore various tracks that shed light on different facets of perception. These tracks include investigating unconscious perception through techniques like Gaze-Contingent Substitution, analyzing conscious perception within a Bayesian framework, and studying the maturation of consciousness in pre-verbal infants using psychophysical measures and high-density EEG.\n\nThe expected impact of this project is threefold: firstly, to provide evidence of sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences; secondly, to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms behind perceptual illusions; and finally, to offer fresh insights into the development of consciousness in humans, particularly in relation to the maturation of specific brain regions. By addressing these key objectives, this project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of conscious and unconscious processes, ultimately contributing to the broader field of cognitive neuroscience."
