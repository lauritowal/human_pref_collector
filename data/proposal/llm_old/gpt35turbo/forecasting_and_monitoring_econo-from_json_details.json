        "This grant proposal seeks funding from the ERC under the Proof of Concept grant type for the project titled \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators.\" The goal of this project is to develop a software/toolbox that improves economic forecasts and decision-making processes by providing real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. The project aims to enhance current methods by utilizing a novel model family, high-frequency information, real-time forecast monitoring, and predictive breakdown tests.\n\nThe target users for this software/toolbox include governments, Central Banks, and firms. Initial collaborations have been established with forecasting agencies and Central Banks. The software will be user-friendly, include three-dimensional graphical representation, and be accessible to decision-makers.\n\nThe impact of this project is expected to lead to prudent economic policy decisions, economic growth, and improved economic and social welfare. The development of novel models and tests for forecasting key economic indicators will focus on evaluating the reliability of model predictions to surpass the current state-of-the-art methods.\n\nOverall, this project aims to contribute to the field of economic forecasting by providing innovative tools that can enhance decision-making processes for various stakeholders in the economic landscape.",
        "The proposed project, \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators,\" seeks funding from the ERC for a Proof of Concept grant to develop a software/toolbox for forecasting and monitoring economic indicators. This project aims to improve economic forecasts and decision-making processes by implementing real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests not currently available in existing software. The project will introduce a novel model family that utilizes high-frequency information for real-time forecast monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. The software will be user-friendly, feature three-dimensional graphical representations, and be accessible to decision-makers in governments, Central Banks, and firms.\n\nThe project has already established collaborations with forecasting agencies and Central Banks to ensure its successful implementation. The expected impact of this project includes enabling prudent economic policy decisions, stimulating economic growth, and enhancing economic and social welfare. This project will contribute to the advancement of forecasting methods and evaluation of model predictions, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques. By bridging the gap between economic data and decision-making, this project aligns with the objectives of the ERC and holds promise for significant contributions to the field of economics.",
        "The proposed project, \"Forecasting and Monitoring Economic Indicators,\" seeks funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Proof of Concept grant type. Building upon previous work in Change-Point Tests (ERC-2007-StG), this project aims to develop a software/toolbox for forecasting and monitoring economic indicators with key improvements such as real-time monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. The project will utilize novel model families and high-frequency information to enable real-time forecast monitoring and predictive breakdown tests. Target users include governments, Central Banks, and firms, with initial collaborations already established with forecasting agencies and Central Banks.\n\nThe project's development aspects focus on creating user-friendly software with three-dimensional graphical representation to enhance accessibility for decision makers. The ultimate objective is to improve economic forecasts and decision-making processes, leading to prudent economic policy, economic growth, and enhanced economic and social welfare. The project's impact will extend to various stakeholders, including governments, financial institutions, and society at large. Overall, this project represents a significant advancement in the field of economic forecasting and has the potential to revolutionize how economic indicators are monitored and predicted."
