        "The proposed project, \"Reward revisited: Towards a comprehensive understanding of motivational influences on human cognition,\" seeks to develop a novel conceptual and neural framework that elucidates how reward impacts human cognition. This project aims to extend the current understanding of reward effects by integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. By employing optimized neuroimaging methods, the research will investigate neural activity in response to reward stimuli.\n\nThe project is significant as it will provide insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. By exploring the cognitive benefits of reward in the healthy mind, the findings from this study can have implications for enhancing cognitive functioning in various contexts. Additionally, the research aims to shed light on disturbances in dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) systems in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of how reward influences human cognition and could have implications for developing interventions to improve cognitive functioning in both healthy and clinical populations.",
        "The proposed project, \"Reward revisited: Towards a comprehensive understanding of motivational influences on human cognition,\" seeks to develop a groundbreaking conceptual and neural framework that elucidates how reward impacts human cognition. This project will delve into related concepts such as motivation, cognitive operations, conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. It will also explore conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, as well as neural systems such as dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA).\n\nThe goals of this project include extending the conceptual understanding of reward effects, integrating factors like stimulus saliency and cognitive-control modes, and employing optimized neuroimaging methods to investigate neural activity. By achieving these goals, this project aims to provide invaluable insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. Additionally, it seeks to shed light on the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals and explore disturbances in DA and NA systems in neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how reward influences human cognition and pave the way for innovative research in the field of psychology and neuroscience.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Reward revisited: Towards a comprehensive understanding of motivational influences on human cognition,\" seeks to develop a new unified conceptual and neural framework to elucidate how reward impacts human cognition. The project aims to extend the current understanding of reward effects by integrating factors such as stimulus saliency, cognitive-control modes, response modes, and the influence of irrelevant information. By employing optimized neuroimaging methods, the study will investigate neural activity associated with reward processing.\n\nThe research will focus on key concepts such as motivation, cognitive operations, conflict resolution, inhibitory control, and memory formation. It will also explore conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, which are known to involve disturbances in dopaminergic (DA) and noradrenergic (NA) neural systems.\n\nThe outcomes of this project are expected to provide valuable insights for both basic and applied psychological and neuroscientific research. By studying the cognitive benefits of reward in healthy individuals and investigating disruptions in DA and NA systems in neurological and psychiatric disorders, this research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the motivational influences on human cognition."
