        "The grant proposal, titled \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade,\" aims to address key research questions surrounding the patterns of international trade and associated welfare effects. Against the backdrop of protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies in Europe, the project seeks to investigate the impact of firm heterogeneity on market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies design, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities.\n\nBy examining the implications of firm-level heterogeneity for trade policy and the productivity distribution of producers, this project will shed light on how individual incentives to trade may diverge from societal objectives. Through theoretical developments and empirical analysis, the research will highlight the need to revisit conventional trade models with homogenous firms in the context of firm heterogeneity.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to inform policymakers on whether governments should intervene to promote or restrict international transactions, taking into account the varying characteristics of firms and their implications for economic integration. By emphasizing the cooperative design of optimal multilateral trade agreements, the project aims to maximize the joint welfare of all trade partners in a globalized and interconnected world.",
        "The grant proposal, \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade,\" aims to address key research questions surrounding the patterns of international trade and their welfare effects, individual incentives versus societal objectives in trade, and the role of government intervention in international transactions. The project is particularly relevant in the context of Europe, where protectionist pressures, resurgent nationalistic tendencies, and disenchantment with globalization are prevalent.\n\nThe proposed project will focus on four work packages: market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies design, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities of a country. By investigating the impact of firm heterogeneity on market inefficiency, trade policy design, comparative advantage determination, and export capability, the project seeks to highlight the need to revisit conventional trade models that assume homogenous firms. This research will contribute to a better understanding of the complexities of international trade and provide insights into how firm-level heterogeneity can shape a country's aggregate economic performance and trade relationships.\n\nOverall, this project aims to shed light on the implications of firm heterogeneity for international trade and facilitate the design of more effective trade policies that maximize joint welfare among trade partners. Through theoretical developments and empirical studies, the project will advance knowledge in the field and inform policymakers on the optimal strategies for promoting global trade in the face of increasing heterogeneity among firms.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"From Micro to Macro: Aggregate Implications of Firm-Level Heterogeneity in International Trade\" seeks to address pressing research questions surrounding the patterns of international trade and the associated welfare effects. In the context of Europe, where protectionist pressures and resurgent nationalistic tendencies are on the rise, there is a growing disenchantment with globalization. The aim of this project is to shed light on key dimensions that challenge conventional trade models with homogenous firms, due to the presence of firm heterogeneity.\n\nThe project will consist of four work packages focusing on market allocative efficiency, optimal multilateral trade policies design, comparative advantages of countries, and exporter capabilities. By investigating the impact of firm heterogeneity on market outcomes and trade policies, the research aims to provide insights into how individual incentives to trade may diverge from societal objectives. Ultimately, the goal is to inform policymakers on whether governments should intervene to promote or restrict international transactions, with the overarching goal of maximizing joint welfare of all trade partners.\n\nThrough theoretical development and empirical analysis, this project will contribute to the academic literature on international trade and offer practical implications for policymakers navigating the increasingly complex global trade landscape."
