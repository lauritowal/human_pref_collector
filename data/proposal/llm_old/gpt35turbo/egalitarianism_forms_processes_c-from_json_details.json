        "The grant proposal, titled \"Egalitarianism: Forms, Processes, Comparisons,\" aims to conduct a library-based global comparative study and field ethnographic studies on the heterogeneity of egalitarian structures, processes, and values. The project's key proposition is to explore egalitarian practices and processes as cultural values, addressing research challenges such as force, contradictions, and limitations. The research goals include integrating library and field studies, understanding the complexities of egalitarian practices, and developing a comparative method that is open to varieties in conceptions and responsive to historical, socio-political, and geo-ecological circumstances. \n\nBy focusing on cultural phenomena related to forms and practices of egalitarianism, the project will examine perennial questions concerning the role of the state, religion, forms of economic distribution, and matters of scale. Research sites will include Europe and elsewhere, with a particular emphasis on the diversity of egalitarian processes. Through its unique approach to decentering orientation heterogeneity and its commitment to developing a tailored comparative method, this project seeks to make significant contributions to the understanding of egalitarianism on a global scale.",

Research sites will include Europe and elsewhere, with a specific emphasis on understanding the diversity of egalitarian processes. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of egalitarianism in different cultural contexts and develop a nuanced comparative approach to studying this complex social phenomenon."
