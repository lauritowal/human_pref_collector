        "The \"Solidarity in the European Union\" grant proposal aims to develop a normative model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1) and apply this model to central issues in the EU (EUSOL2). The project will address key issues such as the free movement of persons, burden-sharing in the EU's refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and enlargement and accession. By providing a normative account of solidarity within the EU context, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of how solidarity can be fostered and maintained across diverse member states. Through rigorous research and analysis, the project aims to inform policy decisions and promote cohesion within the European Union.",
