        "The grant proposal \"Rediscovering the hidden structure: A new appreciation of Juristic texts and Patterns of thought in Late Antiquity\" aims to write a new history of Roman legal culture in Late Antiquity. The project will focus on the manuscript transmission of legal texts and the analysis of emperors' legislation and its motivations during this period. Key elements of the project include the persistence of a high-level legal culture, studying legal texts' manuscript transmission, understanding the role of classical jurists, analyzing emperors' legislation, and exploring the relationship with works of Roman jurists.\n\nThe research teams involved in this project will be composed of three cross-disciplinary teams. They will engage in various activities such as editing collections of papyri and parchments, holding workshops with European scholars, and organizing a final international conference on legal culture. The outputs of the project will include a collection of jurists' writings in direct tradition, a monograph on the history and geography of Late Antique legal literature, a book on Justinian as a lawgiver, and proceedings of the international conference.\n\nOverall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Late Antiquity's Roman legal culture and its manuscript transmission. By exploring the hidden structure of juristic texts and patterns of thought in Late Antiquity, this project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of this period in history.",
