        "The proposed project, titled \"Information services: competition and externalities,\" aims to foster knowledge of the economics of information services by studying strategic interactions, production and exchange of information services, and externalities. The project will focus on understanding one-sided or two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and the complements of information services and physical infrastructures at both the content and physical infrastructure levels.\n\nThe project consists of four parts: background theory, virtual layer, physical layer, and competition policy. Each part will explore specific topics related to externalities in information services, such as two-sided markets, recommendation systems, pricing, and net-neutrality. The approach will involve developing relevant theory, conducting empirical investigations using proprietary data from e-commerce platforms, creating original dynamic investment models, and providing tools for competition policy makers.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute to the understanding of the role of externalities in the economics of information services, providing insights that can inform policy decisions and industry practices in this rapidly evolving sector.",

The approach will involve the development of relevant theory, empirical investigation, original dynamic investment models, and tools for competition policy makers. \n\nThrough the exploration of the role of externalities in the economics of information services, the project seeks to contribute to the understanding of the complexities of information services markets and provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders. The use of proprietary data from transactions on e-commerce platforms will enable a detailed investigation into the dynamics of information services markets.",
        "The proposed project, \"Information services: competition and externalities,\" aims to enhance understanding of the economics of information services by focusing on strategic interactions, production, and exchange of information services, and externalities. The project will delve into one-sided or two-sided network externalities, information as a public good, and the complements of information services and physical infrastructures. It will explore the levels of externalities at the content level and physical infrastructure.\n\nThe project is divided into four parts: Background theory, Virtual layer, Physical layer, and Competition policy. Each part will address specific topics and utilize various methods, including empirical investigation and the analysis of proprietary data from e-commerce platforms. The project will contribute to the development of relevant theory, original dynamic investment models, and tools for competition policy makers.\n\nOverall, this project will offer a comprehensive exploration of the role of externalities in the economics of information services, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry practitioners."
