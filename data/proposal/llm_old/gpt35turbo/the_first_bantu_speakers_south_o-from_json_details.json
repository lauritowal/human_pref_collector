    "title": "The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa",
    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest through a cross-disciplinary approach in Late Holocene Central Africa. The project will focus on the Bantu Expansion phenomenon, a controversial topic with political repercussions, with the goal of understanding the earliest Bantu-speaking village communities. By integrating archaeology, archaeobotany, historical linguistics, and other disciplines, the research will explore the timing, location, and archaeological signature of the earliest villagers, as well as their interaction with hunter-gatherers, subsistence practices, diet, and habitat. Fieldwork will be conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola to gather data on the subsistence, land use, and other aspects of these early communities.\n\nThe project will employ a linguistic approach through lexical reconstruction to study subsistence and land use patterns. Collaborations between universities will facilitate the collection of additional data such as archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic information. Phylogenetic modeling will be used to analyze the data and provide a holistic view on human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Central Africa. This research will address open questions and contribute valuable insights to the understanding of the Bantu Expansion and its implications for the region.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex dynamics of the Bantu Expansion in Late Holocene Central Africa through a cross-disciplinary approach involving archaeology, archaeobotany, historical linguistics, and other disciplines. The project aims to shed light on the origins and spread of the first Bantu-speaking village communities in the region, addressing open questions and controversies surrounding this significant historical event.\n\nBy conducting fieldwork in key locations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola, the research team will examine the timing, location, and archaeological signatures of the earliest villagers, as well as their interactions with hunter-gatherer populations. Through the analysis of archaeological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data, the project will explore various aspects of subsistence, diet, and habitat of these early communities.\n\nThe linguistic component of the study will focus on lexical reconstruction to understand the subsistence and land use practices of the early Bantu speakers. Collaborating with multiple universities and incorporating additional data sources such as archaeozoological and palaeoenvironmental data, the project will employ phylogenetic modeling to provide a holistic view of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Central Africa. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the Bantu Expansion and its broader implications for the history of the region.",
        "The proposed project, \"The First Bantu Speakers South of the Rainforest: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Human Migration, Language Spread, Climate Change and Early Farming in Late Holocene Central Africa,\" aims to delve into the complex dynamics of the Bantu Expansion in Central Africa during the Late Holocene period. This project will address key controversies and open questions surrounding this pivotal moment in human history, with potential political repercussions in the affected regions of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa.\n\nBy employing a cross-disciplinary approach that integrates archaeology, archaeobotany, historical linguistics, and other disciplines, the research team seeks to understand the emergence of the first Bantu-speaking village communities. Fieldwork locations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Angola will provide crucial data on the timing, location, and archaeological signatures of these early villagers, as well as their interactions with hunter-gatherer populations.\n\nThrough the use of lexical reconstruction and phylogenetic modeling, the project aims to reconstruct subsistence patterns, land use practices, and other aspects of early Bantu communities. By bringing together interuniversity collaborations and additional data sources such as archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental, and genetic data, this project offers a holistic view of human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Central Africa."
