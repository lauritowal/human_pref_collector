    "title": "The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation",
    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse, specifically focusing on eviction litigation cases in Europe from 2007 to 2011. By utilizing data science techniques, this project aims to analyze the interaction between national and international legal frameworks in the context of eviction proceedings, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis. \n\nThe proposed research will employ a data-driven approach, utilizing citation network analysis and machine learning to explore patterns in case law data from national supreme courts and lower level courts. By identifying predictors of court decisions and conducting empirical analysis, the project seeks to conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights, shedding light on how this framework influences legal outcomes at the national level.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research include not only a better understanding of the factors influencing court decisions in eviction cases, but also the development of a methodology that can be applied to future projects in other areas of the law. By bridging the gap between national and international legal perspectives on housing rights, this project has the potential to inform policy discussions and legal advocacy efforts aimed at improving housing security for vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this research has the potential to contribute valuable insights to the fields of law, human rights, and data science, with implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in the realm of housing rights.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the impact of the international right to housing on national legal discourse, specifically through the analysis of eviction litigation cases using data science techniques. The project aims to shed light on the interaction between national and international law, particularly in the context of eviction cases, which have affected approximately 700,000 people in Europe between 2007-2011. \n\nThe study will utilize a data-driven approach, employing techniques such as citation network analysis and machine learning to analyze a wealth of legal big data stemming from the aftermath of the financial crisis. By examining case law data from national supreme courts and lower level courts, the project seeks to identify predictors of court decisions and conduct empirical analysis to conceptualize the right to housing as a network of international rights.\n\nThe objectives of the study include the identification of predictors of court decisions, the empirical analysis of eviction litigation cases, and the conceptualization of the right to housing as a network of international rights. The potential outcomes of the project include the development of research applications for future projects in other areas of the law.\n\nOverall, this research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the intersection of national and international legal frameworks in the context of housing rights, with implications for future policy-making and legal scholarship.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"The Impact of the International Right to Housing on National Legal Discourse: Using Data Science Techniques to Analyse Eviction Litigation\", aims to utilize data science techniques to analyze the influence of the international right to housing on national legal discourse, specifically through eviction litigation cases. The project will focus on a dataset of eviction cases impacting approximately 700,000 individuals in Europe during the time period of 2007-2011, a critical period marked by the global financial crisis.\n\nThe project will explore the interaction between national and international legal frameworks, with a particular emphasis on the role of case law data in shaping legal outcomes. By employing a data-driven analysis approach, the project will utilize techniques such as citation network analysis and machine learning to examine data from national supreme courts and lower-level courts. The objectives of the project include identifying predictors of court decisions, conducting empirical analysis, and conceptualizing the right to housing as a network of international rights.\n\nThe potential outcomes of the project include the development of predictive models for court decisions, as well as the creation of a research framework that can be applied to future projects in other areas of the law. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of international legal norms on national legal systems, with the goal of informing policy and advocacy efforts in the realm of housing rights."
