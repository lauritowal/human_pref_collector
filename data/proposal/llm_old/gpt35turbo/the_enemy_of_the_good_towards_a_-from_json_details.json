        "This grant proposal seeks to develop an alternative theory of moral progress titled \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress\". The project will focus on exploring different forms of moral progress, emphasizing moral attitudes that are not constrained by evolutionary factors, and designing smart institutions that can overcome the limitations of our inherited psychology. The proposed theory will center around the concept of expanding the circle of moral concern beyond parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin. By addressing ethical features such as class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership, the goal is to extend moral concern to include all individuals, regardless of arbitrary characteristics. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of moral progress and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable society.",
        "The grant proposal, \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" aims to develop an alternative theory of moral progress that expands beyond traditional evolutionary constraints. This project will focus on different forms of moral progress, exploring various moral attitudes and the role of institutions in overcoming limitations of inherited psychology. The proposed theory will build on the concept of the expanding circle of moral concern, addressing current limitations such as parochial empathy and altruism tied to specific groups. By emphasizing ethical features like class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership, the project seeks to extend moral concern beyond arbitrary distinctions. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of moral progress, offering insights that can inform ethical decision-making and social policy.",
        "The grant proposal, \"The Enemy of the Good: Towards a Theory of Moral Progress,\" seeks to develop an innovative theory of moral progress that goes beyond traditional evolutionary constraints. The project aims to explore various forms of moral progress, different moral attitudes not limited by our inherited psychology, and the role of smart institutions in facilitating moral development. By focusing on expanding the circle of moral concern and overcoming limitations such as parochial empathy and altruism tied to friends and kin, the proposal aims to extend moral concern beyond ethically arbitrary features like class, age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and species membership. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of moral progress and contribute to the development of more inclusive and ethical societies."
