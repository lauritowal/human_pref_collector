        "This grant proposal, titled \"The Rise and Fall of Populism and Extremism,\" aims to conduct an empirical study on the factors influencing political decisions, specifically focusing on personal experiences, information environment, and aggregate economic shocks. The project consists of three main research parts: \n\n1. Examining the impact of personal employment histories and information environment on voting for Trump using a database of over 40 million resumes from 2010-2016 and zipcode-level economic and voting variables.\n2. Investigating the influence of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas by utilizing archival records on corporal punishment regulations in UK schools from the 1970-80s, along with contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting.\n3. Analyzing the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes through a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda during WWII Germany.\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to understand the role of economic shocks in the rise of populism and the varying responses to such shocks. By combining diverse data sources and innovative research methodologies, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between personal experiences, societal influences, and political decision-making.",

Part two will investigate the influence of negative social experiences on labor market outcomes and support for populist agendas, using archival records on corporal punishment regulations in UK schools from the 1970-80s and contemporary data on educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting patterns. \n\nPart three will delve into the factors driving active resistance to extremist regimes, utilizing a self-collected dataset on treason cases and data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda during WWII in Germany. The overarching goal of the project is to explore the role of economic shocks in the rise of populism and the varying responses to such shocks. This research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of populism and extremism, offering implications for policy interventions and societal resilience against extremist ideologies."
