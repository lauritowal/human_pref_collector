        "This grant proposal seeks to address the legal status of religious minorities in the Euro-mediterranean world from the 5th to the 16th centuries. The objective of this project is to collect, publish, and study legal texts that define the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe. The project will focus on sources such as Roman law, Canon law, national or royal law, urban law, Rabbinical responsa, and Fatwa collections. The specific sources to be examined include Theodosius code, Justinian code, Acta of Church councils, Decretum attributed to Gratian, and more.\n\nThe outputs of this project will include a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, workshops, an international conference, comparative thematic studies, proceedings of the conference, a sourcebook of selected legal texts, and a monograph on the legal status of minorities. The goals of this project are to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. The target audience for this project includes scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations. Ultimately, this project aims to be a major reference tool for research in the history of minority law and interreligious relations.",

        "The grant proposal, \"The legal status of religious minorities in the Euro-mediterranean world (5th-16th centuries)\", aims to collect, publish, and study legal texts that define the status of religious minorities in pre-modern Europe. Focusing on the period from the 5th to the 16th centuries, the project will explore the legal frameworks governing Christian, Muslim, and other religious minority groups in regions spanning Europe and the Euro-mediterranean area. Drawing from a diverse range of sources including Roman law, Canon law, and rabbinical responsa, the project will create a database of texts and translations, an annotated bibliography, and a sourcebook of selected legal texts. Through workshops, an international conference, and comparative thematic studies, the project seeks to encourage collaborative interdisciplinary work and innovative research across traditional divides. The ultimate goal is to provide a valuable reference tool for scholars and researchers in the history of minority law and interreligious relations. By shedding light on the legal protections and restrictions faced by religious minorities in the past, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of religious coexistence and conflict in the Euro-mediterranean world."
