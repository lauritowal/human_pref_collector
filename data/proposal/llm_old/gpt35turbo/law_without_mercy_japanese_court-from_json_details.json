        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Law without Mercy: Japanese Courts-Martial and Military Courts During the Asia-Pacific War, 1937-45\". The project will focus on the period between 1937 and 1945 in regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia, examining the actions of Japanese soldiers, judge-advocates, civilians, and enemy soldiers within military courts. The key purposes of the study include regulating violence for war goals, deterring and coercing civilian populations, and exploring the legitimacy and legality of Japan's war efforts.\n\nThrough an analysis of legal practice and the routinisation and escalation of violence, the project aims to shed light on the outcomes of these courts-martial, which often resulted in executions and harsh imprisonments. Drawing on original archival work, the research will contribute to fields such as modern Japanese history and international law. Additionally, the study will have implications for contemporary humanitarian issues, providing historical insights that can inform current debates and practices.\n\nBy delving into the complexities of military justice and violence during the Asia-Pacific War, this project will offer a nuanced understanding of the legal and ethical challenges faced during wartime. Ultimately, the grant funding will support the comprehensive exploration of this important historical period, offering valuable insights for both academic scholarship and broader discussions on justice and human rights.",
