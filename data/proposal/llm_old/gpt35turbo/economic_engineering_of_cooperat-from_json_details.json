        "The grant proposal \"Economic Engineering of Cooperation in Modern Markets\" aims to address the crucial role of cooperation in the economy and society through an economic engineering approach. Inspired by the work of Alvin Roth, the project seeks to tackle cooperation problems prevalent in modern markets and societies using experimental methods and behavioral game theory.\n\nThe project is divided into three work packages, each focusing on a specific aspect of cooperation. The first package will explore electronic reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in the digital world, addressing the flaws in current trust mechanisms online. The second package will develop mechanisms to prevent arms races for speed in real-time financial and electricity market trading, reducing collective wastefulness and threats to market liquidity and stability. The third package will design markets aligned with ethical considerations, such as reciprocal kidney exchange and buying pollution rights, addressing societal distaste for certain transactions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include improved functioning of modern markets, advancements in cooperation sciences, and innovations in behavioral economic engineering. By enhancing cooperation in modern markets, this project has the potential to have a significant impact on both the economy and society as a whole.",
