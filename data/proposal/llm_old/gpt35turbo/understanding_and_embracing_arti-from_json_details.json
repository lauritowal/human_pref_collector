        "The proposed project, \"Understanding and embracing artificial agents’ impact on the social dynamics of families\" (F-AI-MILY), seeks to investigate the influence of artificial agents on family social dynamics by combining insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. The project aims to establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach for studying family neurocognition, track developmental changes in social dynamics during prolonged interactions with artificial agents, and determine how sustainable interactions with artificial agents can benefit households dealing with chronic illness.\n\nKey methods include the development of a group-centred mobile lab to analyze social dynamics affected by artificial agents, the measurement of behavioral and brain indicators of family members' attitudes and behaviors, testing child development interactions with artificial agents, examining the long-term consequences of living with artificial agents on families with children aged 4-12, and guiding the design of artificial agents to assist vulnerable households.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to unravel social dynamics with unprecedented precision, shift maladaptive social dynamics to adaptive ones in families coping with chronic illness, and foster an interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, full-circle approach to studying the impact of artificial agents on family dynamics. Through this research, F-AI-MILY aims to enhance our understanding of how artificial agents shape family dynamics and contribute to the well-being of families facing chronic illness.",
        "The proposed project, \"Understanding and embracing artificial agents’ impact on the social dynamics of families\" (F-AI-MILY), aims to investigate the influence of artificial agents on family social dynamics by combining insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. The project will introduce a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to explore family neurocognition, track developmental shifts in social dynamics during prolonged interactions with artificial agents, and assess how sustainable engagements with these agents can aid households managing chronic illness.\n\nThe project will involve the creation of a group-centred mobile lab to examine social dynamics affected by artificial agents, the measurement of behavioural and brain indicators of family members' attitudes and actions, the evaluation of child development in response to artificial agent interactions, and the analysis of the enduring impacts of cohabitating with artificial agents on families with children aged 4-12. Additionally, the project seeks to inform the development of artificial agents tailored to assist vulnerable households.\n\nBy adopting an interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, full-circle approach, this project aims to unveil social dynamics with unparalleled precision and transparency, and to promote the transformation of maladaptive family interactions into adaptive ones, especially among families grappling with chronic illness. Through these efforts, F-AI-MILY aspires to generate valuable insights into how artificial agents can positively shape family social dynamics and enhance overall well-being.",
        "The proposed project, \"F-AI-MILY\", aims to explore and comprehend the influence of artificial agents on the social dynamics within families by integrating insights from family psychology, social neuroscience, and human-AI interaction. This innovative study seeks to establish a novel group-centred mobile-lab approach to analyze family neurocognition, describe the evolution of social dynamics over extended interactions with artificial agents, and determine how sustained engagement with these agents can benefit households dealing with chronic illnesses. The project will involve the development of a mobile lab designed to observe the impact of artificial agents on social dynamics, assess behavioral and neural markers of family members' attitudes and actions, investigate how children's development is influenced by interactions with artificial agents, and evaluate the long-term effects of cohabiting with artificial agents on families with children aged 4-12. Ultimately, the research aims to provide unparalleled insights into social dynamics within families, facilitate the transition from maladaptive to adaptive social behaviors in families facing chronic illness, and guide the development of artificial agents to support vulnerable households. The project's interdisciplinary, neurocognition-at-home, and full-circle approach will enable a comprehensive understanding of artificial agents' role in shaping family dynamics."
