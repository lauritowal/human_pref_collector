        "The grant proposal, titled \"Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks,\" aims to revolutionize language understanding beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches. The project will focus on Western linguistic thinking and will explore the evolution of language over time, from Homo sapiens to the invention of alphabets. The research will delve into the Chinese writing system features, such as character spacing and syllabic structures, to enhance literacy training from early childhood.\n\nUsing wide learning networks with two-layer structures and error-driven learning rules, the project will match human processing strengths and weaknesses. By incorporating current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the research program aims to advance auditory comprehension, model diverse languages, extend speech production capabilities, and develop discrimination-based language theories.\n\nThe proposed research seeks to challenge the dominance of alphabet-centric approaches in language studies by investigating how languages utilize acoustic signals to reduce uncertainty in message encoding. With a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative methodologies, this project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of language processing mechanisms. The funding request will support the project's ambitious goals and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in the field of linguistics.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks,\" aims to advance our understanding of language beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches. The project will focus on exploring Western linguistic thinking, with an emphasis on literacy training from early childhood. The methodology involves utilizing wide learning networks with two-layer structures and many thousands of units, guided by the simplest error-driven learning rule. The research goal is to investigate language understanding by leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of human processing.\n\nThe proposed project aligns with current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence, seeking to push the boundaries of language comprehension. Key areas of research advancement include auditory comprehension development, modeling diverse languages, speech production extension, and the development of discrimination-based language theories.\n\nBy challenging the alphabet-centric approach and emphasizing the importance of low-level properties of the acoustic signal in language processing, this project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of language. The funding request will support the advancement of research programs that have the potential to reshape the field of linguistics and cognitive science.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Wide Incremental learning with Discrimination nEtworks\" aims to revolutionize the field of language understanding by moving beyond traditional phone and word-based approaches. The project will focus on Western linguistic thinking, with a particular emphasis on exploring the Chinese writing system features, such as character spacing, context dependency, and syllabic structures. The research will utilize wide learning networks with two-layer structures and a large quantity of units to mimic human processing strengths and weaknesses. By utilizing the simplest error-driven learning rule, the project seeks to advance auditory comprehension development, model diverse languages, extend speech production capabilities, and develop a discrimination-based language theory.\n\nThis innovative research program challenges the dominance of alphabet-centric approaches and aims to uncover the low-level properties of the acoustic signal that languages use to reduce uncertainty in message encoding. With a deep understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence trends, this project has the potential to reshape our understanding of language evolution and literacy training. The funding request will support the exploration of new methodologies and the advancement of linguistic research beyond traditional boundaries."
