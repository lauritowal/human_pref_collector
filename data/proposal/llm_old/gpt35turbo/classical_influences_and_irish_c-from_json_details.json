        "The grant proposal \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture\" aims to explore the unique and underexplored history of Ireland's cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome. The hypothesis posits that despite not being part of the Roman Empire, Ireland has a tradition of classical learning evident in its earliest recorded literature. The research will focus on why this cultural interaction is unique, with nine thematic areas including language, land, travel and exile, and global influence.\n\nThe approach of the project will be multi-thematic, using a heuristic framework and fostering dialogue between various fields such as classical reception studies, Irish and British history, and postcolonial studies. The project will also examine contemporary preoccupations such as the politics and history of Ireland, as well as the violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe expected impact of the project includes opening new investigation avenues, understanding how classical culture influences literary, social, and political discourses in Ireland, and tracing historical influences beyond the past 100 years. This project has the potential to shed light on a lesser-known aspect of Irish culture and its connections to the classical world.",
        "The proposed project, \"Classical Influences and Irish Culture,\" aims to explore the unique and underexplored history of Ireland's cultural engagement with ancient Greece and Rome. This research is crucial as Ireland was not part of the Roman Empire, yet has a strong tradition of classical learning and the earliest recorded literature. The project will focus on nine key themes such as language, land, travel and exile, Troy, satire, Neoplatonism, female voices, material culture, and global influence.\n\nUsing a multi-thematic approach and a heuristic framework, this project will foster a dialogue between various fields including classical reception studies, Irish and British history, English and Irish-language literature, medieval studies, postcolonial studies, philosophy, material culture, women's studies, and global studies. The research will also address contemporary preoccupations such as the politics and history of Ireland, as well as the centenary commemorations of the independent Irish state and the ongoing violence and political divisions in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe expected impact of this project includes opening new investigation avenues, highlighting the influence of classical culture on literary, social, and political discourses, and exploring historical influences beyond the past 100 years. This research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the intersection of classical influences and Irish culture, enriching our understanding of both.",
