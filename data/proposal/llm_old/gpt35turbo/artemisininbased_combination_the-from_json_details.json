    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, titled \"Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa,\" aims to investigate the global drug market using Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as a case study in two African countries (Benin and Ghana) with differing pharmaceutical systems, and compare the findings with a study in Cambodia. The objectives of the project include studying the realities affecting the global drug market in terms of supply and demand, analyzing globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana, studying public health consequences, comparing drug systems, and addressing the issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa.\n\nThe project will involve disciplines such as Anthropology, Epidemiology, and Sociology, and will include work packages focusing on various aspects of the drug market. The goals of the project are to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and to provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. Additionally, the project will provide training opportunities for Master students, PhD students, and Post-doctoral researchers.\n\nWith the Principal Investigator's skills in methodology and theory, as well as solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, this project has the potential to contribute valuable insights into the global pharmaceutical drug market and inform strategies to improve pharmaceutical systems in Africa.",
        "The proposed project, \"Artemisinin-based combination therapy: an illustration of the global pharmaceutical drug market in Asia and Africa,\" aims to investigate the global drug market using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) as a case study in Benin, Ghana, and Cambodia. Through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology, the project seeks to study the realities affecting the global drug market in terms of supply and demand, analyze globalizing processes impacting drug systems in Benin and Ghana, and assess the public health consequences of these systems. \n\nThe project will involve a series of work packages focusing on various aspects of pharmaceutical supply, drug use, ACT consumption, local production, and regulations, as well as an examination of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. By training 8 Master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doctoral researcher, the project aims to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs. \n\nWith the Principal Investigator's expertise in methodology and theory, supported by solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, the project aims to contribute valuable insights into the global pharmaceutical drug market and its implications for public health in Africa and Asia. Through the dissemination of results and organizing symposiums, the project aspires to have institutional impacts and advance the understanding of pharmaceutical systems in the context of global health.",

The objectives of this study include analyzing the realities affecting the global drug market in terms of supply and demand, studying the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana, and addressing the issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. \n\nThis interdisciplinary project involves disciplines such as Anthropology, Epidemiology, and Sociology, and includes work packages focusing on the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply, analysis of drug use, and analyzing local production and ACT regulations. The project also aims to foster reflection for more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project will involve training components for Master students, PhD students, and Post-doctoral researchers.\n\nWith the Principal Investigator's skills in methodology and theory, along with solid partnerships in Benin and Ghana, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights into the global pharmaceutical drug market, particularly in the context of ACTs, and ultimately impact public health policies and practices in Africa and Asia."
