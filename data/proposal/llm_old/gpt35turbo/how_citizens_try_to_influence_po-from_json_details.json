        "The proposed project, \"How citizens try to influence politics and why: International comparisons of movement and party politics,\" aims to investigate patterns of political participation in various countries within a unified theoretical and methodological framework. The project will focus on contentious politics, party politics, political participation, and democratic societies. Through meta-analysis, global survey data comparisons, focus group discussions, and experimental focused surveys, the project seeks to understand individuals' political engagement or apathy, explore the causes of different modes of political participation, and examine the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal dynamics.\n\nThe project will involve eight countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina. Subprojects include a meta-analysis of publications on movement and party politics, comparisons of political participation using existing global survey data, focus group discussions to understand the formation of political engagement and disengagement, and experimental focused surveys among 1000 respondents in the eight countries.\n\nBy studying these diverse contexts, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing political participation across different societies. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how citizens engage with politics, ultimately informing strategies to enhance democratic participation and civic engagement globally.",
        "The proposed project, \"How citizens try to influence politics and why: International comparisons of movement and party politics,\" aims to examine participation in contentious and non-contentious politics across countries using a unified theoretical and methodological framework. The focus areas include contentious politics, party politics, political participation, and democratic societies. Through methods such as meta-analysis, global survey data comparisons, focus group discussions, and experimental surveys, the project seeks to achieve objectives such as understanding individuals' political engagement or apathy, investigating causes of different modes of political participation, and exploring the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal dynamics. The project involves countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Argentina. Subprojects include a meta-analysis of published works, comparisons of political participation using existing survey data, focus group discussions in eight countries, and experimental surveys among 1000 respondents in the same eight countries. By analyzing the data collected through these various methods, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing political engagement and disengagement across diverse societies, contributing to a deeper understanding of citizen involvement in politics on a global scale.",
