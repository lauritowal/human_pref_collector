        "The proposed project, \"Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of life by exploring the concept of self-assembly as a fundamental process in biological systems. Traditional views of life emphasize the role of external energy inputs and genetic regulation, but self-assembly offers a new perspective on how complex patterns and structures can emerge spontaneously without external guidance. The AssemblingLife project aims to develop a novel theoretical framework within the philosophy of science that centers on self-assembly processes.\n\nThis interdisciplinary project will draw on fields such as nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science to achieve its objectives. Key aims include redefining genetic causation by conceptualizing genes as 'nudgers' and creating a new theory of scientific explanation for self-assembly processes. The potential impacts of this research are significant, as it has the potential to shift the prevailing view of life in both scientific and philosophical circles. Additionally, the project will provide valuable conceptual tools to enhance research in the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences.\n\nBy shedding light on the role of self-assembly in the organization and functioning of living systems, the AssemblingLife project has the potential to reshape our understanding of life at its most fundamental level.",
        "The proposed project, \"Self-Assembly: Shifting our View of Life,\" seeks to establish a new theoretical framework within the philosophy of science by exploring the concept of self-assembly in biological systems. Traditional views of life emphasize the role of genetic material and external inputs of energy in the regulation of biological processes. However, self-assembly offers a different perspective, highlighting the spontaneous formation of complex patterns and structures without external guidance.\n\nThe project aims to bridge the fields of nanoscience, chemistry, biology, material science, and philosophy of science to achieve two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to develop a novel understanding of genetic causation by conceptualizing genes as 'nudgers' rather than deterministic factors. Secondly, it seeks to establish a new theory of scientific explanation that can account for the self-assembly processes observed in biological systems.\n\nThe potential impacts of this project are significant, as it has the potential to shift the prevailing view of life in both scientific and philosophical domains. By providing conceptual tools to both the philosophy of science and empirical life sciences, this project has the potential to reshape our understanding of biological systems and open up new avenues for research and discovery.",

By shedding light on the importance of self-assembly in the understanding of life, the AssemblingLife project has the potential to reshape our fundamental perceptions of biological systems and contribute to groundbreaking advancements in interdisciplinary research."
