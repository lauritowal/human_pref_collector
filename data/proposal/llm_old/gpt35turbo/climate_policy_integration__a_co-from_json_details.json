        "The proposed project, \"CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\", aims to develop a new theory on policy integration processes to address the lack of coordination among growing policy regimes. Focused on the EU's projected failure to meet its net-zero target by 2050, the research will examine synergistic and contradictory interdependencies at a system-level, utilizing quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, and comparative case studies. Objectives include revealing integration patterns, understanding temporal dynamics, identifying system-level solutions, and simulating policy reforms. Comparative analysis will focus on coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration within the EU and selected member states. Expected outcomes include insights and advice to enhance climate policy integration in the EU, with broader impacts on policy debates. With the researcher's background in analysing actor constellations in policy processes, this project has the potential to inform and improve climate policy integration efforts at both national and EU levels.",
        "The proposed project, \"CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\", aims to develop a new theory on policy integration processes to address the coordination challenges of growing policy regimes. Focusing on the EU's projected failure to meet its net-zero target by 2050, the research will analyze the lack of a system-level understanding of synergistic and contradictory interdependencies, inadequate theories, and study methods in current research. Using a variety of methodologies including quantitative modeling, network analysis, and comparative case studies, the project seeks to reveal patterns of policy (dis)integration, understand temporal dynamics, identify system-level solutions, and simulate policy reforms. Through a comparative analysis of the EU and selected member states, the study will examine coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The expected outcomes include insights and recommendations to enhance climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing the policy debate beyond climate issues. With the researcher's expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of climate policy integration.",
        "The \"CLIMate policy integration – a comPLEXITY trap?\" grant proposal aims to develop a new theory on policy integration processes to address the coordination challenges faced by growing policy regimes. With a focus on understanding the synergistic and contradictory interdependencies at a system-level, the project will utilize quantitative modeling, network analysis, process tracing, interviews, surveys, and comparative case studies. By examining patterns of policy (dis)integration, temporal dynamics, and system-level solutions, the research will provide insights to improve climate policy integration in the EU. The comparative analysis will involve the EU and selected member states, focusing on coordination mechanisms for climate policy integration. The project's expected outcomes include valuable advice for enhancing climate policy integration in the EU, with broader implications for advancing policy debates beyond climate issues. Led by researchers with expertise in analyzing actor constellations in policy processes, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of climate policy and governance."
