        "The proposed project, titled \"An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative,\" seeks to challenge the conventional assumption that higher levels of interpersonal synchrony always lead to better mental health outcomes. The project, SynSig, aims to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures, explore tailored corrections to these signatures, and analyze how relationships can be transformed into curative ones through adjustments in synchrony. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will utilize multimodal markers such as motion, acoustic, physiological, and facial expression data. Individuals will be studied in dyadic interactions with both humans and virtual humans, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of synchrony dynamics. The project will also develop a novel multimodal feedback system to facilitate momentary corrections to synchrony signatures based on individual needs.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include the identification of individual-specific synchrony signatures, insights into the multi-layered nature of synchrony on an individual level, and a better understanding of how human interactions impact mental health. By drawing causal inferences between synchrony adjustments and mental health outcomes, SynSig aims to provide a personalized approach to enhancing well-being through interpersonal synchrony.",
        "The proposed project, \"An individual-specific understanding of how synchrony becomes curative,\" seeks to challenge the generic assumption that higher levels of interpersonal synchrony always lead to better mental health outcomes. SynSig aims to investigate individual-specific synchrony signatures, explore tailored correction of synchrony patterns, and analyze how relationships can transform into curative ones through synchrony adjustments. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will implement multimodal markers (motion, acoustic, physiological, facial expression) to study individuals in dyadic interactions with both humans and virtual humans. A novel multimodal feedback system will be developed to facilitate momentary corrections in synchrony signatures, enabling individual-tailored changes in synchrony. By drawing causal inferences between synchrony adjustments and mental health outcomes, the project aims to provide evidence of individual-specific synchrony signatures, reveal insights into the multi-layered nature of synchrony, and enhance our understanding of the connection between human interactions and mental health. \n\nOverall, SynSig represents a groundbreaking effort to advance our understanding of how synchrony can be leveraged on an individual level to promote mental well-being, ultimately leading to more effective interventions tailored to the unique needs of each individual.",
