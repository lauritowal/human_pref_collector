    "descriptions": [
        "The HOMEOSTASIS project aims to investigate the dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling in working memory. Current theories on working memory focus on its limited-capacity nature, often overlooking the role of interaction with the visible world. This project seeks to fill this gap by proposing a new model of internal mental economy that maintains perceptual homeostasis by balancing internal storage with external sampling.\n\nBy conducting novel experiments that involve interaction with physically present environments, such as utilizing electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology, this project will test the hypothesis that individuals minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature. The study will also include patient populations with specific deficits to validate components of the proposed model.\n\nFurthermore, the project will leverage machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements, with the ultimate goal of diagnosing working memory disorders and understanding its interaction with computer-manipulated virtual environments.\n\nOverall, the HOMEOSTASIS project will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of working memory and its implications for cognitive processes. This research has the potential to have a significant impact on both theoretical models of working memory and practical applications in diagnosing and treating related disorders.",
        "The HOMEOSTASIS project aims to investigate the dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling in working memory, proposing a novel theoretical model to explain how individuals maintain perceptual homeostasis. The project will address the limitations of current dominant theories, which focus solely on the absence of information in working memory, by exploring the interaction between internal cognitive resources and the visible world. \n\nUsing innovative experimental paradigms that incorporate physically present environments, such as electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology, the project will examine how individuals minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature. Additionally, the project will include a patient study involving individuals with specific deficits related to the proposed model, aiming to discover biometric signatures in eye movements through machine learning applications.\n\nThe outcomes of the HOMEOSTASIS project are expected to have significant implications for diagnosing working memory disorders and understanding how individuals interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments. By developing a comprehensive understanding of the internal mental economy in working memory, this project has the potential to advance our knowledge of cognitive processes and their impact on human behavior.",
        "The HOMEOSTASIS project aims to investigate the dynamic trade-off between internal storage and external sampling in working memory, proposing a new theoretical model to explain this interaction. Working memory is a limited-capacity system crucial for maintaining perceptual homeostasis, yet current dominant theories focus solely on the absence of information. This project seeks to fill this gap by exploring how individuals balance internal storage and external information sampling to optimize cognitive processes. \n\nUsing novel paradigms that integrate physically present environments, the project will employ electroencephalographic decoding and virtual reality technology to study how individuals minimize internal storage due to its effortful nature. By studying patients with restricted deficits in specific components of the model, the project also aims to diagnose working memory disorders and understand how individuals interact with computer-manipulated virtual environments. Additionally, the project will utilize machine learning techniques to discover biometric signatures in eye movements, providing valuable insights into cognitive processes.\n\nOverall, the HOMEOSTASIS project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of working memory and its interaction with the visible world. The proposed research will not only contribute to theoretical advancements in cognitive psychology but also have practical implications for diagnosing and treating working memory disorders."
