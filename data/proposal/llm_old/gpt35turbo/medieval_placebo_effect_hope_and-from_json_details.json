        "The \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\" grant proposal seeks to explore the intersection of hope, belief, and healing practices in medieval medicine within the context of Southern Europe from 1100 to 1500. This project will utilize a triangular approach to investigate the ideas, practices, and organizing structures that shaped the medieval placebo effect. By identifying the forces that articulated this phenomenon, the research aims to facilitate a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions, demonstrating the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities during this time period. Furthermore, the project will examine the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing, as well as explore the legacy of the medieval health system and its negotiation in the 21st century. The implications of this research include a deeper understanding of therapy elements in medieval healing, insights into the impact of soul/mind on health, and a foundation for contemporary examination of healing practices. Despite challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, the \"Medieval Placebo Effect\" project aims to contribute valuable insights to the fields of history, medicine, and psychology.",

        "The proposed project, \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500,\" seeks to explore the role of hope, belief, and trust in shaping healing practices during the medieval period in Southern Europe. Through a triangular approach that examines ideas, practices, and organizing structures, the project aims to identify the forces that articulated the medieval placebo effect and demonstrate the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities. By analyzing the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks in healing, the project will shed light on the legacy of the medieval health system and its negotiation in the 21st century.\n\nThe project's goals include fostering a dialogue between current debates and medieval perceptions, understanding therapy elements in medieval healing, and providing insights into the impact of soul/mind on health. By addressing challenges such as distrust in medical services and difficulties in overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research, the project will lay the foundation for a contemporary examination of healing practices. Ultimately, this research has the potential to contribute valuable insights to the fields of medieval medicine and healthcare, as well as inform discussions on the intersection of belief, trust, and healing in both historical and modern contexts."
