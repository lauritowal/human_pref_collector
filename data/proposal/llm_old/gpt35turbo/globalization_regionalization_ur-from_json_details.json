        "The proposed project, titled \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century,\" aims to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime perspective over a span of 300 years. Utilizing data from Lloyd's List register, the project seeks to achieve several goals. These include mapping the spatial distribution of maritime flows through dynamic and interactive visualizations, as well as analyzing the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links using graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks. The project also aims to study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development by examining the evolution of port cities and hinterlands, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. By integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions, the project will provide valuable insights into the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development. The project's significance lies in its ability to shed light on the historical and contemporary dynamics of globalization, regionalization, and urbanization through the lens of maritime networks.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century\" aims to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime perspective over a span of 300 years. Utilizing data from Lloyd's List register, the project seeks to achieve several goals. Firstly, it intends to map the spatial distribution of maritime flows through dynamic and interactive visualizations on a geomatics visualization platform. Secondly, it aims to analyze the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links using graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks, while comparing them with general models of networks. Lastly, the project will study the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development by focusing on the evolution of port cities and hinterlands, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks. This will involve integrating data from global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics of nations and regions.\n\nOverall, this project will provide valuable insights into the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development over the past three centuries, shedding light on the complex interactions between globalization, regionalization, and urbanization within the context of the worldwide maritime network.",
        "The grant proposal \"Globalization, regionalization, urbanization: an analysis of the worldwide maritime network since the early 18th century\" aims to map the changing spatial pattern of the world economy from a maritime perspective across 300 years. Leveraging data from Lloyd's List register, the project will focus on three main goals: mapping the spatial distribution of maritime flows, analyzing the topological and spatial structure of the global network of inter-port links, and studying the co-evolution of maritime transport and urban/regional development.\n\nUsing methods such as graph theory, social network analysis, and complex networks, the project will provide dynamic and interactive visualizations as well as a geomatics visualization platform to showcase the findings. Comparative analysis with general models of networks will help understand the evolution of the network. By integrating global databases on urban population, trade flows, and socio-economic characteristics, the project will explore the evolution of port cities and hinterlands, as well as the inter-connectivity between maritime and land-based transport networks.\n\nOverall, this project will shed light on the impact of maritime flows on the global economy and urban development, providing valuable insights into the historical and contemporary dynamics of globalization, regionalization, and urbanization."
