        "The \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity\" project, known as BabMed, aims to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. Focusing on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine in the Babylonian Talmud, which is written in Aramaic, the project seeks to test hypotheses that suggest cuneiform survived longer than previously thought and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud largely stems from Akkadian medicine. By utilizing native taxonomies and comparing with neighboring medical systems, BabMed challenges the prevalent Eurocentric histories that often only compare to Greek medicine. The project aims to establish a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer by overcoming barriers such as script and language. With a unique text in the Babylonian Talmud and a geographical context spanning Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia, BabMed is positioned to reveal how Babylonian medicine survived the transition from cuneiform to Aramaic script. This project represents a significant contribution to the understanding of ancient medical practices before Hippocrates, providing valuable insights into the scientific thinking of both worlds.",
        "The proposed project, \"Fragments of cuneiform medicine in the Babylonian Talmud: Knowledge Transfer in Late Antiquity,\" seeks to conduct the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. The focus of the study, named BabMed, will be on the latest phase of Babylonian medicine as seen in the Babylonian Talmud, written in Aramaic. The project aims to challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity in current histories by comparing Babylonian medicine with neighboring medical systems, particularly Greek medicine. By relying on native taxonomies and exploring the unique text of the Babylonian Talmud, this project will establish a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer in late antiquity. Despite barriers such as script and language, the project will demonstrate how Babylonian medicine survived the death of the cuneiform script and was preserved in the local Aramaic of the Talmud. This research will provide valuable insights into the scientific thinking of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia, offering a unique perspective on medical knowledge dissemination before the time of Hippocrates.",

The project will address barriers such as script and language to reveal how Babylonian medicine persisted even after the decline of cuneiform script, providing valuable insights into the scientific thinking of the ancient world."
