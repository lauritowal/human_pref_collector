        "The proposed project, titled \"Cultural Evolution of Kinship Diversity: Variation in Language, Cognition, and Social Norms Regarding Family,\" aims to investigate the evolution of kinship diversity across cultures and over time through comparative phylogenetic modeling. The research components of the project include three main focuses: VARIKIN-Evolution, which examines kinship terminologies and family norms change using comparative phylogenetic modeling across 8 language families; VARIKIN-Usage, which explores the usage of kinship language in spoken and written forms through methods such as corpus linguistics, surveys, and interviews; and VARIKIN-Development, which studies children's acquisition and understanding of kinship in small-scale, non-Western communities using participant observation and elicitation tasks.\n\nThe objectives of the project include analyzing patterns of kinship change, examining the impact of social norms on kinship terminology, linking individual usage patterns to historical processes, and characterizing the cross-cultural acquisition of kinship by children. The approach of the project involves integrating macro- and micro-evolutionary processes, highlighting its highly multidisciplinary nature. By shedding light on the cultural evolution of kinship diversity, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between language, cognition, and social norms regarding family across different societies and historical contexts.",
