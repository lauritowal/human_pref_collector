        "The proposed project, \"Developing and delivering neurocomputational models to bridge between brain and mind,\" focuses on the field of Cognitive Neuroscience with the overarching goal of understanding the nature of mental processes and how they arise from neural machinery. By investigating complex mental behaviors, mapping neural systems and their functions, and developing methods to bridge brain and mental behavior, the project aims to establish the basis of neurological patients' impairments and improve clinical management and treatment.\n\nKey components of the project include the convergence of methods and the development of a new type of neurocomputational model. Utilizing experimental psychology, behavioral neurology, in vivo neuroimaging, and allied technologies, the project will secure methods and tools for systematic bridging between cognitive science and systems neuroscience. By mimicking normal and impaired behavior and connecting neuroanatomy and cognition, the project will provide a novel formalism for bridging between brain and cognition.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute to advancing our understanding of the relationship between the brain and the mind through the creation of neurocomputational models that reflect systems-level neuroanatomy and function. Through the utilization of computational models, the project aims to bridge the gap between brain and mind, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for neurological patients.",
