        "The proposed project, titled \"The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use,\" aims to address the least studied and understood aspect of maritime expansion - the history of cartography, specifically nautical charts. The current state of research in this field is in its infancy, with detailed technical study lacking. This project seeks to shed light on key research questions such as the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, the technical evolution of charts over time, and the use of charts at sea.\n\nThe methodology employed in this research will be interdisciplinary, combining analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and the examination of manuscripts through special lighting techniques. The objectives of the project include unveiling hidden graphic content, characterizing main geometric features, establishing connections with navigational methods, and simulating chart construction numerically. Building upon previous work on the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, this proposed research will tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer period.\n\nThe impact of this project extends beyond the field of History of Cartography, influencing intellectual history at large. By investigating the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods, this proposal aims to fill a significant gap in the understanding of maritime expansion and cartographic practices.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"The Medieval and Early Modern Nautical Chart: Birth, Evolution and Use,\" aims to delve into the least studied and understood realm of maritime expansion through the lens of the History of Cartography. The current state of research in this area is still in its infancy, presenting a prime opportunity for detailed technical study. The project seeks to address key research questions such as the origin of pre-Mercator nautical charts, the technical evolution of charts over time, and the practical use of charts at sea.\n\nEmploying an interdisciplinary approach, analytical cartometric methods, numerical modeling, and manuscript examination under special lighting, the project aims to unveil hidden graphic content, characterize main geometric features, establish connections with navigational methods, and simulate chart construction numerically. Building upon previous work that solved the historical enigma of Mercator projection construction, the proposed research will tackle a broader and more complex set of questions over a longer duration.\n\nThe impact of this research extends beyond the History of Cartography to encompass intellectual history at large. By shedding light on the technical and historical aspects of nautical charts from the medieval and early modern periods, this project seeks to fill a significant gap in the understanding of maritime expansion and navigation.",
