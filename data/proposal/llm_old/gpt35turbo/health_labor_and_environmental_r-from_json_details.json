        "The \"Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\" grant proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of environmental quality improvement in the context of post-industrial Europe. With a focus on the main origins of regulated pollution, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, this project aims to provide new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail. By taking an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models, the project will also incorporate subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates.\n\nThe project is divided into two main parts: the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration. The key objective is to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management. With a potential large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus, this project is a priority for policy makers given the increasing demand for environmental quality and the challenges posed by global climate change.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Health, Labor and Environmental Regulation in Post-Industrial Europe\", aims to address pressing issues related to environmental quality improvement in the context of post-industrial Europe. The project is of high priority for policy makers due to the global climate change crisis and increasing demand for environmental quality. The main origins of regulated pollution, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, will be a focal point of the research.\n\nThe proposed project will make significant contributions to the field through the development of new tools for economic impact analysis with enhanced spatial detail, an interdisciplinary approach linking causal inference on pollution emissions to chemical transport models, and the incorporation of subclinical and long-term health impacts into economic damage estimates.\n\nWith a focus on the economic implications of local air quality changes due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration, the key objective is to provide empirical evidence to inform environmental policy-making in the contexts of climate policy and air quality management.\n\nThe potential impact of this project is vast, as it has the potential to make a large impact on global environmental problems and policy focus.",
