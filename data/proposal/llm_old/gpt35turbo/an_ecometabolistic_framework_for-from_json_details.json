        "The grant proposal, titled \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture,\" seeks to address the global crisis of material depletion through an interdisciplinary approach focused on sustainable building practices and the utilization of bio-based materials. The project aims to overcome challenges in transitioning to bio-based materials in architecture by developing a novel eco-metabolistic framework. This framework will enable the design of carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized solutions through research-by-design methods. The project will investigate materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria, utilizing computational modeling networks for predictive modeling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing.\n\nBy conceptualizing architecture as a continual construction beyond building completion, the project aims to generate outcomes that promote participatory practices, sustainable design, socially conscious models of production, and democratic production processes. The proposed project challenges traditional design agency and offers new practices to leverage the short lifespans of bio-based materials for sustainable architecture.",
        "The proposed project, \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture,\" aims to address the global crisis of material depletion by focusing on sustainable building practices and a bio-based material paradigm. The project will tackle challenges such as architecture's transition to bio-based materials, representation of these materials in architecture, and their conceptualization and operationalization within the field. The project will introduce an eco-metabolistic framework to develop carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions through research-by-design methods. Materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria will be investigated, with a focus on predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. The project's design agency concept involves continual construction beyond building completion, aiming for participatory and socially conscious models of production. By pushing the boundaries of traditional design agency, this project seeks to establish democratic models of production that exploit the short lifespans of bio-based materials for sustainable architecture.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"An Eco-Metabolistic Framework for Sustainable Architecture.\" The project aims to address the global crisis of material depletion by focusing on sustainable building practices and the utilization of bio-based materials in architecture. The proposed framework is eco-metabolistic, with objectives including the development of carbon-neutral, renewable, and materially optimized design solutions. The project will use a research-by-design approach to investigate materials such as glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. Computational modelling networks will be employed for predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. The design agency concept involves continual construction beyond building completion, challenging traditional practices in architecture. The project will explore participatory and sustainable practices, as well as socially and democratically conscious models of production. Overall, this project seeks to revolutionize the representation, conceptualization, and operationalization of bio-based materials in architecture to create a more sustainable future."
