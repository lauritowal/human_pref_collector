    "title": "Towards an evidence-based model for big data policing: Evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological and legal and ethical conditions",
    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal aims to address the fragmented expertise and lack of interdisciplinarity in big data policing in Europe by developing an evidence-based model that integrates statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions. The project will focus on evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical conditions of big data policing to fill the current knowledge gaps and enhance the effectiveness of predictive policing strategies. \n\nThe proposed model will be tested through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles, utilizing variables such as previous crime events, poverty index, residential mobility, presence of shops, distance to nearest highway, intelligent cameras, and police patrol intensity. This project will offer PhD tracks in statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical aspects, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the field of big data policing.\n\nThe innovation aspect of this project lies in its focus on transparency regarding predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and adherence to legal and ethical standards, distinguishing it from commercial and economic initiatives. By bridging the gaps in current knowledge and integrating various disciplines, this project aims to contribute to the development of a more effective and ethically sound approach to big data policing in Europe.",
        "This grant proposal aims to address the fragmented expertise in big data policing in Europe and the lack of interdisciplinary studies in this field by developing an evidence-based model for big data policing. By integrating statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions, the proposed project seeks to fill the gaps in current knowledge and provide a comprehensive framework for optimizing police resource deployment and reducing crime rates.\n\nThe project will focus on evaluating the statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical conditions necessary for the successful implementation of big data policing strategies. Through randomized controlled trials based on European and interdisciplinary principles, the proposed model will be tested to ensure its effectiveness and reliability in predicting high-risk crime locations.\n\nThe innovative aspect of this project lies in its emphasis on transparency regarding the predictive reliability, validity, effectiveness, and adherence to legal and ethical standards. By steering away from commercial and economic initiatives, the proposed approach aims to establish a robust and ethically sound foundation for big data policing practices.\n\nOverall, this grant proposal seeks to bridge the existing gaps in big data policing research and provide a framework that can be utilized to enhance the efficiency and impact of policing strategies in Europe and beyond.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the fragmented expertise and lack of interdisciplinary studies in big data policing in Europe by developing an evidence-based model that integrates statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical dimensions.

By training PhD students in statistical-methodological, criminological, legal, and ethical aspects, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of evidence-based practices in big data policing. Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive model that can be used by law enforcement agencies to effectively combat crime and enhance public safety."
