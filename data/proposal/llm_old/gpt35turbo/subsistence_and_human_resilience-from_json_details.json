        "The proposed project, \"Subsistence and human resilience to sudden climatic events in Europe during MIS3,\" focuses on the impact of climate on Neanderthal extinction and Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) colonization during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in the Southern European peninsulas. Through the examination of 20 key sites using methodologies such as Zooarchaeological analysis, Taphonomic analysis, and Stable isotope analysis, the project aims to assess behavioral flexibility and resilience, reconstruct local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions, and develop a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity. By studying Neanderthals and AMH, the project seeks to identify subsistence strategies in response to climatic changes.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research include a better understanding of subsistence patterns favoring AMH and an assessment of the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction. This prehistoric study on a pan-European scale is crucial for shedding light on human adaptation and resilience in the face of sudden climatic events. Ultimately, the findings from this project will contribute valuable insights to the fields of archaeology, paleoanthropology, and climate science.",
        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the subsistence strategies and human resilience to sudden climatic events in Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition, specifically focusing on the impact of climate on Neanderthal extinction and Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) colonization. The project will be conducted at 20 key locations in the Southern European peninsulas using methodologies such as zooarchaeological analysis, taphonomic analysis, and stable isotope analysis.\n\nThe objectives of this research include assessing behavioral flexibility and resilience, reconstructing local terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions, and developing a procedure to estimate ecosystem carrying capacity. By studying Neanderthals and AMH, this project seeks to understand subsistence patterns that favored AMH and assess the impact of climatic oscillations on Neanderthal extinction.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this study include a better understanding of subsistence patterns that supported AMH survival and insights into the factors contributing to Neanderthal extinction. This research is relevant as it contributes to the prehistory study on a pan-European scale, shedding light on how past human populations adapted to and survived sudden climatic events.",
