        "The proposed project, \"Staging National Abjection: Theatre and Politics in Turkey and Its Diasporas,\" aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of theatre in national abjection and the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas from the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Through a transdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic research approach, the project will explore case studies such as theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide, the negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas, Islamic theatre in Turkey and European diasporas, Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe, and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. The research objectives include investigating the role of theatre in shaping 'the Turkish nation' and its Others, providing insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre under a conservative neoliberal government, and exploring the relationship between artistic performance and the politics of belonging in the nation-state. By advancing understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe and offering insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas.",
