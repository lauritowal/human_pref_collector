        "This grant proposal, titled \"Towards a computational account of natural sequential behavior,\" aims to develop computational models that can identify and characterize perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks. The goals of this project include understanding and modeling sequential actions involving perceptual uncertainty and action variability, as well as characterizing internal and external costs and benefits in the context of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty.\n\nThe proposed methods involve conducting behavioral experiments and integrating various disciplines such as psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. The tasks to be studied include classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and even a real-world task like sandwich making.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits including effort, and action variability. The research team has previous experience in experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical work in modeling behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis. This project will significantly advance our understanding of natural sequential behavior and its computational underpinnings.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to develop computational models to elucidate and characterize perception, cognition, and action in everyday tasks, under the project titled \"Towards a computational account of natural sequential behavior.\" The primary goals of this project are to gain insights into and model sequential actions that involve perceptual uncertainty and action variability, as well as to characterize the internal and external costs and benefits associated with optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty. The proposed methods include conducting behavioral experiments and integrating various disciplines such as psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning. The tasks involved in this research encompass classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and sandwich making. Anticipated outcomes include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, understanding beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits including effort, and analysis of action variability. This project builds upon previous experimental work on visuomotor behavior and theoretical modeling of behavior on an individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial basis. Ultimately, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the computational mechanisms underlying natural sequential behavior.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to develop computational models that aim to understand and characterize natural sequential behavior in everyday tasks. The project will focus on identifying perception, cognition, and action in tasks involving perceptual uncertainty and action variability. By integrating psychophysics, statistical decision theory, active vision, intuitive physics, optimal control under uncertainty, navigation, and inverse reinforcement learning, the research team plans to conduct behavioral experiments to explore classical psychophysical production tasks, visuomotor control, navigation, and even mundane tasks like sandwich making.\n\nThe outcomes of this project are expected to include the recovery of subjects' perceptual uncertainties, beliefs about tasks, subjective costs and benefits (including effort), and action variability. Building on previous experimental and theoretical work on visuomotor behavior and individual-by-individual and trial-by-trial modeling, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how humans make decisions and execute actions in real-world scenarios. Ultimately, this research will provide valuable insights into the computational mechanisms underlying natural sequential behavior, with implications for fields such as psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence."
