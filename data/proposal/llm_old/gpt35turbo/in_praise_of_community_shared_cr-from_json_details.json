        "The proposed project, \"In praise of community: shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979),\" aims to explore the impact of commonality practices on the performing arts in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. By studying, collecting, and contextualizing artist collaborations, the project seeks to highlight the significance of artistic communities locally and internationally. The application of the 'will-to-the-common' concept to counterculture art will provide a unique perspective on the role of community in shaping artistic expression.\n\nThrough innovative methodologies such as new modelling of performing arts knowledge and interpretation, as well as the creation of a digital archive of Italian artists' performances, the project will contribute to a comprehensive approach to preserving and disseminating the heritage of Italian performing arts. By engaging with historical, philosophical, and artistic debates, as well as sociology and social network theory, \"In praise of community\" will offer a multidisciplinary analysis of the impact of communal practices on the arts.\n\nUltimately, this project, through its emphasis on community and collaboration, will shed light on the transformative power of shared creativity in shaping artistic movements and legacies. \"In praise of community\" will be a pioneering study in the field of performing arts, providing valuable insights into the intersection of art, politics, and community in Italy during a pivotal period in history.",
