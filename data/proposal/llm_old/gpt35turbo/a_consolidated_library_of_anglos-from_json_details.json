        "The \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" grant proposal aims to create an innovative online repository of all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse from the period c. 670–1100 CE. This project will involve marking up the texts in TEI P5 XML to ensure accessibility and interactivity for users. With a corpus size of 60,000 lines of poetry in Old English and Anglo-Latin, this consolidated library will offer a comprehensive resource for scholars and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe project will focus on 50 named poets, documenting their influence and tracing potential influences in anonymous verse. By including digital resources such as sound and image files, as well as organizing events like conferences and workshops, the proposal seeks to engage a wide audience and foster collaborative research opportunities.\n\nThe resulting publications will form a series that aims to create a comprehensive multilingual corpus, shedding light on the cultural and linguistic context of Europe during this period where Latin and the vernacular co-existed in a Christian setting. By consolidating these manuscripts, the project will provide valuable insights into the literary heritage of the Anglo-Saxon era and contribute to scholarship in the field.",
        "The proposed project, \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry,\" aims to create a comprehensive online repository of all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse, dating from approximately 670 to 1100 CE. The library will be marked up using TEI P5 XML, allowing for interactive access and analysis. With a corpus size of 60,000 lines of poetry in Old English and Anglo-Latin, the project will include works from 50 named poets, along with anonymous verse, to document and trace potential influences.\n\nUtilizing digital resources such as sound and image files, the project will also host events like conferences and workshops to engage scholars and the public. Publications will focus on creating a multilingual corpus to explore the influence of Latin and vernacular languages in a Christian context across Europe.\n\nBy consolidating these diverse sources and providing a platform for analysis, the project seeks to advance research on the literary and cultural history of the Anglo-Saxon period. The proposed library will not only benefit scholars in the field but also serve as a valuable resource for educators, students, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the rich poetic tradition of this era.",
        "The \"A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" grant proposal aims to create an online, interactive library housing all surviving Anglo-Saxon verse, marked up through TEI P5 XML. With a period spanning from c. 670 to 1100 CE, this project will encompass poetry in Old English and Anglo-Latin, totaling 60,000 lines across 50 named poets, typically found in manuscript form.\n\nThe focus of this endeavor is twofold: documenting the influence of named poets and tracing potential influence in anonymous verse. Through the incorporation of digital resources such as sound and image files, as well as hosting events like conferences and workshops, this project seeks to engage scholars and the public alike.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to produce a comprehensive multilingual corpus, published as a series, that sheds light on the interplay between Latin and vernacular languages in a Christian European context. By providing a centralized hub for Anglo-Saxon poetry, this initiative will facilitate research and exploration of the rich literary traditions of this era, fostering a deeper understanding of the cultural and linguistic landscape of medieval Europe."
