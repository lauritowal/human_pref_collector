        "The proposed project, \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" aims to investigate how men's changing family and working lives impact their health and cognition. With a focus on improving men's health and cognition, the project seeks to address the gender disparities in premature mortality rates and preventable excess mortality among men. By exploring trends in family and working lives, such as the increasing role of men in caregiving and the loss of the male breadwinner model, the project aims to enhance gender equality and societal contributions.\n\nThe research will focus on men in young adulthood and midlife, examining cohort and period differences, the work-face interface, the male breadwinner model, and fathers' participation in childcare. By utilizing a methodology that disentangles selection and causality, the project will analyze data from Norwegian population registers, surveys, and genetic data, as well as health measures and employment data. With a sample size of over 12,000 men spanning from late teens to midlife, the project will provide insights into the complex interactions between family, work, health, and cognition.\n\nThe funding for this project is currently pending, but with the potential to extend our understanding of men's health and cognition in the context of evolving family and work dynamics, this research has the opportunity to make significant contributions to both academic knowledge and societal well-being.",
        "The proposed project, \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" aims to investigate how men's evolving family and work dynamics impact their health and cognitive abilities. With men facing higher premature mortality rates and significant preventable excess mortality, the project seeks to address gender disparities by enhancing men's health and cognition. By examining trends such as the lag in tertiary education attainment for men, increased female labor participation, and the rise in male childlessness rates, the project aims to shed light on the changing landscape of family and work roles for men.\n\nThe research objective focuses on men's health and cognition during young adulthood and midlife, exploring cohort and period differences, the work-family interface, the male breadwinner model, and fathers' involvement in childcare. Utilizing a methodology to disentangle selection and causality, the project will draw on Norwegian population data, including register, survey, and genetic data, as well as health measures and employment data. With a cognitive trajectories sample size of over 12,000 men spanning from late teens to ages 36-69, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing men's health and cognition.\n\nPending funding, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to understanding and improving men's health outcomes and cognitive function in the context of changing family and work dynamics.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Health, Cognition, Family, and Employment among Men,\" seeks to investigate how men's changing family and working lives impact their health and cognition. The project aims to address the gender health disparity, particularly focusing on the higher premature mortality rate and significant preventable excess mortality among men. By improving men's health and cognition, the proposal aims to contribute to gender equality by enhancing men's roles in families, increasing their participation in the labor market, and extending their potential contributions to society.\n\nThe research will examine trends in family and working lives, including the tertiary education gap between men and women, changes in male and female labor participation rates, and the impact of technological advancements on job loss risks for men. Additionally, the study will explore the rise in male childlessness, increased fathers' participation in childcare, and the evolving male breadwinner role. The research objective focuses on men's health and cognition during young adulthood and midlife, analyzing cohort and period differences, the work-face interface, the male breadwinner model, and fathers' participation in childcare.\n\nUtilizing a variety of data sources, including Norwegian population data, health measures, and employment data, the study will have a sample size of over 12,000 men within the age range of late teens to 36-69. The methodology will disentangle selection and causality to provide valuable insights into how men's health and cognition are influenced by their family and working lives. The project's funding status is currently pending, awaiting support to advance this critical research."
