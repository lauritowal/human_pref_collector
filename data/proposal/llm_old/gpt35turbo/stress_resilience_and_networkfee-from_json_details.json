        "The \"Stress Resilience and Network-Feedback Training\" grant proposal aims to investigate the impact of acute stress on the brain's network dynamics and develop a method for training stress resilience. The project will focus on gaining insight into brain adaptation to acute stress, identifying transdiagnostic biomarkers of stress resilience, and creating a training method for enhancing stress resilience.\n\nThe hypotheses of the project suggest that acute stress causes dynamic shifts in resource allocation within large-scale networks. The objectives include characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during acute stress and recovery, identifying neural markers predicting resilience to stress, cross-validating markers in high stress sensitivity patient groups, and examining the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts.\n\nThe project will utilize approaches such as network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback. The target of the research is large-scale neural systems and higher-order cognition. Ultimately, this project offers a novel framework to understand alterations in neural systems due to acute stress as shifts in network balance. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of stress resilience and provide valuable insights for developing interventions to enhance resilience to stress.",

The project will explore the impact of acute stress on large-scale neural networks, identifying biomarkers of stress resilience and sensitivity. By characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of network shifts during stress and recovery, the study aims to develop a deeper understanding of how the brain responds to stress at a neural level.\n\nUsing a combination of network connectivity modeling, wearable biosensors, mobile applications, and functional MRI neurofeedback, the project will examine the roles of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in rapid network shifts. Additionally, the project will investigate the disruption of cognitive functions caused by imbalances in neural networks and develop fMRI neurofeedback techniques to train adaptive reallocation of neural resources.\n\nThis innovative framework will provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying stress resilience and sensitivity, paving the way for personalized interventions to enhance stress resilience. By cross-validating neural markers in high stress sensitivity patient groups, the project aims to contribute to the development of transdiagnostic biomarkers and interventions for stress-related disorders. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve our understanding of stress resilience and develop effective strategies to promote mental health and well-being.",
