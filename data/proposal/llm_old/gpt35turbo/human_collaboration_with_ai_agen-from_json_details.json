    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a multi-sited ethnographic study on human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance. The project aims to investigate the organizational circumstances under which data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI recommendations. Key concepts to be explored include algorithmic ethics, ethical AI, big data, and AI systems. The research will address gaps in understanding the socio-cultural context, organizational collaboration with AI, and empirical evidence of human intervention with AI.\n\nThe study will analyze moments of human intervention with AI in six national settings, with the goal of developing a theory on the organizational factors that influence ethical AI practices. Future-scenarioing anthropological methods will be used to connect anthropological insights with AI development. By partnering with health decision-makers and policy institutions, the project aims to have a significant impact on national health policies and individual human lives.\n\nOverall, this research will provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between humans and AI in the context of national health governance, ultimately contributing to the development of more ethical and effective AI systems in healthcare.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a multi-sited ethnographic study on human collaboration with AI agents in national health governance. The project aims to fill research gaps in understanding the socio-cultural context and organizational dynamics influencing human intervention with AI in healthcare decision-making. By analyzing moments when data analysts and medical experts follow or deviate from AI recommendations, the study will contribute to the development of a theory on organizational factors for ethical AI. Through partnerships with health decision-makers and policy institutions, the research will have a direct impact on national health policies and individual human lives.\n\nThe project will investigate key concepts such as algorithmic ethics, ethical AI, big data, and AI systems in six diverse national settings. Using future-scenarioing anthropological methods, the study will provide empirical evidence on the interaction between humans and AI in healthcare governance. By connecting anthropological insights with AI development, the research will inform the design and implementation of ethical AI systems in the healthcare sector. Overall, this project has the potential to transform national health governance by fostering responsible human-AI collaboration and ensuring the ethical use of AI technologies in healthcare decision-making.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the complex dynamics of human collaboration with AI agents in the realm of national health governance. Through a multi-sited ethnographic study, the project aims to address critical research gaps surrounding the socio-cultural context and organizational circumstances influencing human intervention with AI in healthcare decision-making processes. By analyzing moments of interaction between data analysts, medical experts, and AI systems in six diverse national settings, the research team intends to develop a comprehensive theory on the organizational factors that shape ethical AI practices. \n\nUtilizing future-scenarioing anthropological methods, the project will bridge anthropological insights with AI development, ultimately influencing national health policies and improving individual human lives. By partnering with health decision-makers and policy institutions, the study anticipates a significant impact on the integration of AI technologies in healthcare governance. Through a combination of empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, this research project aims to contribute valuable insights to the growing field of algorithmic ethics and ethical AI, fostering a deeper understanding of the implications of human-AI collaboration in the context of national health governance."
