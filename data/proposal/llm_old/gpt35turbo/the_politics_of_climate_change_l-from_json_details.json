        "The grant proposal titled \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\" seeks to address the urgent need to develop effective policies in response to the consequences of climate change within the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The project, named CCLAD, will focus on the emergence and contestation of justice norms at both international and national levels, particularly in the policy areas of disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration. \n\nUtilizing an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic methodology, the project aims to understand the conditions for norm hegemony, influence, contestation, or reversal, and to generate new insights into norm-content fluidity. By examining the micro-politics of international negotiations and conducting comparative research on domestic policy practices, the research will contribute methodologically to political ethnography and the development of practice-tracing methods. \n\nThrough a detailed study of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage, this project will address the lack of consensus on loss and damage policy and provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders. Ultimately, the research outcomes will contribute to the development of more informed and effective policies to address the growing challenges of climate change.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\" seeks to investigate the emergence and contestation of norms, specifically justice norms, within the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The urgent need to address the consequences of climate change, including disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration, highlights the lack of consensus on loss and damage policy. The project, named CCLAD, will employ an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic methodology to examine the dynamics at both international and national levels.\n\nThe objectives of the project include understanding the conditions for norm hegemony, exploring avenues for influencing, contesting, or reversing norms, and developing a new understanding of norm-content fluidity. The research will focus on how norms are partly constituted through policy-making and implementation, utilizing methods such as the micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative research on domestic policy practices. The project aims to make methodological contributions to political ethnography and develop practice-tracing methods.\n\nThrough the study of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage, this project has the potential to inform policy-making and implementation processes at the international and national levels, ultimately contributing to more effective responses to the challenges posed by climate change.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage\". The project falls within the research area of International Relations and focuses on the emergence and contestation of norms, specifically justice norms, within the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The urgent need to address the consequences of climate change is highlighted, with a particular emphasis on areas such as disaster risk reduction, non-economic losses, finance, and climate-related migration.\n\nThe lack of consensus on loss and damage policy is a key issue that this project aims to address through an interdisciplinary theoretical and ethnographic methodology. The project, named CCLAD, will operate at both the international and national levels of governance. Objectives include understanding the conditions for norm hegemony, influencing, contesting, or reversing norms, and developing a new understanding of norm-content fluidity.\n\nThe project will employ research methods such as the micro-politics of international negotiations and comparative research on domestic policy practices. The expected contributions include methodological advancements in political ethnography and the development of practice-tracing methods. Overall, this project will provide a valuable study of norm emergence and contestation in the context of climate change loss and damage."
