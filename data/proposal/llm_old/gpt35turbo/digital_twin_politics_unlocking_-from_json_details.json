        "The \"Digital twin politics: Unlocking the full potential of digital twins for sustainable ocean futures\" grant proposal aims to investigate the socio-technical development of Digital Twin Objects (DTOs) for national scientific and political purposes, as well as the politics surrounding their international utilization. With the European Commission already working on a prototype DTO for the ocean, this project will address challenges such as time constraints, data gaps, and the need to align with global sustainability objectives for ocean conservation. Potential risks include perpetuating global inequalities, legal uncertainties, and the possibility of misuse. \n\nTo tackle these issues, the project will re-conceptualize digital twins as socio-technical relationships and employ a methodological approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative research methods. The study will focus on examining the practices, policies, and politics associated with digital twins, as well as the use of DTOs in multilateral negotiations. The research will be conducted in the contexts of the EU, USA, and China.\n\nBy breaking new ground in this area, the \"Digital twin politics\" project will contribute valuable insights into how digital twins can be leveraged to promote sustainable ocean futures while navigating the complex socio-political landscape at both national and international levels.",
        "The grant proposal \"Digital twin politics: Unlocking the full potential of digital twins for sustainable ocean futures\" aims to examine the socio-technical making of Digital Twin Objects (DTOs) for national scientific and political purposes, as well as the politics of developing and using DTOs in an international setting. This project is crucial as the European Commission is currently building a prototype digital twin of the ocean. The proposal will address challenges such as time pressure, persisting data gaps, and the implementation of global sustainability goals for ocean protection.\n\nBy re-conceptualizing digital twins as socio-technical relations, this project will develop a methodological approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research. The study areas will focus on the practices, policies, and politics of digital twins, as well as the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations. The project will analyze these aspects in the contexts of the EU, USA, and China.\n\nThe innovative approach of \"Digital twin politics\" will break new ground by providing valuable insights into the development and use of digital twins in various national and international settings. It will also address risks such as perpetuating global inequalities, legal and political uncertainties, and the potential for abuse and misuse of DTOs. This project holds great potential for advancing sustainable ocean futures through the responsible and effective use of digital twin technology.",
        "The \"Digital twin politics: Unlocking the full potential of digital twins for sustainable ocean futures\" grant proposal aims to investigate the socio-technical aspects of Digital Twin Objects (DTOs) for national scientific and political purposes, particularly in an international context. The project will address the challenges of time pressure, data gaps, and the implementation of global sustainability goals for ocean protection. It will also explore potential risks such as perpetuating global inequalities, legal uncertainties, and the potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe proposed approach involves re-conceptualizing digital twins as socio-technical relations and developing a methodological framework that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods. The study will focus on examining the practices, policies, and politics surrounding digital twins, as well as the use of DTOs during multilateral negotiations. The project will be conducted in the contexts of the EU, USA, and China.\n\nThrough the \"TwinPolitics\" project, we aim to advance understanding in this field by developing innovative research methodologies and providing valuable insights into the development and use of digital twins in different national and international settings. This project will contribute to shaping sustainable ocean futures by informing decision-making processes and promoting responsible and ethical practices in the use of DTOs."
