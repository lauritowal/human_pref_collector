        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the complex interplay between brain networks and social networks in adolescents, titled \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks\". The project will integrate social network research with social brain research to explore the social-cognitive functions in a cohort of 1000 adolescents over a period of 3 years. The study design is longitudinal, with 6 measurements conducted annually, including fMRI scans on a subsample of 100 participants. \n\nThe research will involve experimental tasks such as understanding and interacting with others, using tools like social network analysis and a social neuroscience experimental approach. Assessment techniques like ecological momentary assessment will be employed to gather data on the dynamic phase of the interplay between social networks and the social brain. Data will be collected through surveys and mobile sensing to understand how changes in the social brain relate to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development.\n\nThis project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying social cognition in adolescents and contribute to our understanding of social development during this critical period of life.",
        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the interplay between brain networks and social networks in adolescents, focusing on social cognition. The project will involve a cohort of 1000 adolescents over a period of 3 years, with 6 measurements taken at regular intervals. A subsample of 100 participants will undergo yearly fMRI scans to examine brain activity related to social cognition. The study will utilize social network analysis and a social neuroscience experimental approach to assess how changes in the social brain correspond to changes in social network position and structure. Experimental tasks will include understanding and interacting with others, while assessment techniques such as ecological momentary assessment will provide real-time data on social behavior. Data sources will include surveys and mobile sensing technology to gather comprehensive information on social networks. By elucidating the relationship between the social brain and social networks during adolescent development, this research aims to advance our understanding of social cognition in this critical period of life.",
        "The proposed project, \"Social Cognition in Adolescents: Brain Networks and Social Networks,\" aims to investigate the interplay between social networks and the social brain in adolescents. This longitudinal study will involve a cohort of 1000 adolescents, with 50 classes participating over a period of 3 years. The project will utilize a social neuroscience experimental approach, including fMRI scans on a subsample of 100 participants annually, to examine the social-cognitive functions of understanding and interacting with others.\n\nThe research will focus on integrating social network analysis with social brain research, using tools such as surveys and mobile sensing to collect data on social networks. Ecological momentary assessment will be used as an assessment technique to gather information on participants' social interactions. The primary goal of the study is to clarify how changes in the social brain correspond to changes in social network position and structure during adolescent development.\n\nBy shedding light on the relationship between brain networks and social networks in adolescents, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the social cognitive processes that underlie social behavior during this critical developmental phase."
