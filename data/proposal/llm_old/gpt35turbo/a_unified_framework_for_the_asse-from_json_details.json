        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models.\" The project aims to address the current challenges in the field of cognitive modeling, including the proliferation of ideas and techniques, idiosyncratic applications, and the lack of clarity on the state-of-the-art. \n\nThe proposed project will develop a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models, utilizing Bayesian inference foundations and exploring efficient algorithms for parameter estimation. The focus will be on drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. \n\nKey enhancements include constructing plausible parameter priors, developing diagnostic experiments, and assessing Bayes factors for hierarchical designs. The outcome of the project is to set a new standard for cognitive modeling, with practical relevance by incorporating techniques into JASP software and making new methodology available to students, researchers, and practitioners.\n\nBy funding this project, stakeholders will support the advancement of cognitive modeling and contribute to the development of a standardized framework that will benefit the research community.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"A Unified Framework for the Assessment and Application of Cognitive Models,\" aims to address the current challenges in the field of cognitive modeling, including the proliferation of ideas and techniques, idiosyncratic applications, and unclear state-of-the-art. The project will focus on developing a unified program for the assessment and application of cognitive models, using Bayesian inference foundations to assess absolute and relative goodness-of-fit, explore efficient parameter estimation algorithms, and apply models to data from popular experimental designs.\n\nSpecifically, the project will focus on drift decision models, stop-signal race models, and reinforcement learning models. Enhancements will include constructing plausible parameter priors, developing diagnostic experiments, assessing Bayes factors for hierarchical designs, and model-averaging parameter changes. The ultimate outcome of this project is to set a new standard for cognitive modeling, with practical relevance by incorporating techniques into the JASP software and making new methodology available for students, researchers, and practitioners.
