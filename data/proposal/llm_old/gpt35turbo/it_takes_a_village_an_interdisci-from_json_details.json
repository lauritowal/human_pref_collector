        "The proposed project, \"It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions,\" aims to understand multi-generational communication within and beyond family contexts. The project, named InterCom, will combine laboratory research, real-world experimentation, intrapersonal and interpersonal measures to address key research questions such as the role of age-related differences in brain rhythms in conversational flow, how listeners process speech from different age groups, and the impact of intergenerational miscommunications.\n\nThe methodology involves collecting brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events, co-designed with community partners. The project will use data from real-world events to inform subsequent laboratory studies and vice versa. The objectives include combining laboratory and real-world data collection and developing stimuli and analyzing data in a reciprocal manner between lab and real-world settings.\n\nThe goals of the project are to understand multigenerational communication and generate insights and tools to investigate and improve communication between and across generations. The project's innovation lies in testing a novel 'community neuroscience' approach, leveraging the benefits of naturalistic observations and experimental control, and innovating on combining laboratory and real-world data collection, stimulus development, and data analysis.",
        "The project \"It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions\" seeks to explore multi-generational communication dynamics within and beyond family settings. The InterCom project aims to investigate age-related differences in brain rhythms that may affect conversational flow, how listeners process speech from different age groups, and whether intergenerational miscommunications stem from differences in predicting others' speech. \n\nThrough a unique combination of laboratory research, real-world experimentation, and diverse data collection methods, InterCom will gather brain, body, and language data from children, adults, and older adults during storytelling events co-designed with community partners. By integrating data from both real-world and laboratory settings, the project aims to develop a reciprocal approach to stimulus development and data analysis.\n\nThe objectives of this project include understanding multigenerational communication patterns and generating insights and tools to enhance communication across different age groups. By testing a novel 'community neuroscience' approach that combines naturalistic observations with experimental control, InterCom seeks to advance the field of neuroscience research and provide valuable contributions to improving intergenerational communication.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"It takes a village: an interdisciplinary community neuroscience approach to characterize multigenerational interactions,\" seeks to delve into the complexities of multi-generational communication within and beyond family contexts. The project, named InterCom, aims to investigate age-related differences in brain rhythms that may affect conversational flow, explore how listeners process speech from children and older adults, and assess whether intergenerational miscommunications stem from a lack of predictive skills in certain age groups.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project will collect brain, body, and language data from diverse groups of children, adults, and older adults during real-world storytelling events. Additionally, the team will collaborate with community partners to co-design these events and use the data collected to inform subsequent laboratory studies, creating a reciprocal relationship between real-world and controlled settings.\n\nBy combining innovative methods of data collection and analysis, InterCom aims to not only deepen our understanding of multigenerational communication but also develop insights and tools to enhance communication between and across generations. The project's novel 'community neuroscience' approach will leverage the strengths of naturalistic observations while maintaining experimental control, pushing the boundaries of traditional research practices in this field."
