        "The grant proposal titled \"The new flow of news: how social network sites transform news organization and citizens political behavior\" seeks to investigate the impact of social network sites (SNS) on traditional news organizations and citizens' political behavior. With the decline of traditional news sources and the increasing attention given to SNS, this project aims to explore the process and reveal the implications of this industry transition. The proposed new model will focus on the network logic and key actors involved, such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees.\n\nUsing innovative approaches, big data analysis, and small N in-depth designs, the project will study news organizations through interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, and content analysis. Additionally, users' behavior will be examined through laboratory observation, surfing behavior measurement, and physiological attention indices. Long-term effects on political beliefs and behaviors will be measured using survey panel data and web-based behavioral data over a two-year period.\n\nThe research impact of this project includes a novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, as well as the establishment of new methodological standards in audience research. Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into how the integration of SNS into news platforms is shaping news production and influencing citizens' political behavior.",
        "The proposed project, \"The new flow of news: how social network sites transform news organization and citizens political behavior,\" aims to investigate the impact of social network sites (SNS) on news organization and political behavior. With the decline of traditional news sources and the increase in attention on SNS, there is a pressing need to explore the process and implications of this industry transition. The project will focus on the network logic of the new model, involving key actors such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees.\n\nUtilizing innovative approaches such as big data analysis and small N in-depth designs, the study will involve interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, content analysis, laboratory observation, surfing behavior measurement, and physiological attention indices. Long-term political effects will be measured through survey panel data and web-based behavioral data spanning a two-year period.\n\nThe research impact of this project lies in its novel conceptualization of news distribution, consumption, and influence, as well as the establishment of a new methodological standard in audience research. By shedding light on how SNS are transforming news production and shaping political behavior, this project has the potential to inform future policies and practices in both news organizations and political arenas.",

With the decline of traditional news outlets and the increase in attention towards SNS, this study seeks to explore the process and reveal the implications of this industry transition. The project will introduce a new model that emphasizes network logic and involves key actors such as news organizations, news feeders, and news feedees. \n\nUtilizing innovative approaches, big data analysis, and small N in-depth designs, the research will involve studying news organizations through interviews with news editors, traffic data analysis, and content analysis.
