        "The proposed project, \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel,\" aims to investigate the complex interplay between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration in the West African Sahel region, with a specific focus on Mali. By targeting farmers and pastoralists as key stakeholders, this project seeks to understand why some smallholders choose to resist violently while others remain compliant in the face of land dispossession. The central hypothesis posits that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or engage in violent resistance, with a particular emphasis on the role of 'jihadist' groups in these dynamics.\n\nUtilizing a mixed methods approach informed by theoretical frameworks such as political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, this project aims to generate novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, as well as shed light on the intricate connections between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration. The expected outcomes include the production of new knowledge that can inform policy formulation and contribute to a deeper understanding of the socio-political dynamics at play in the Sahel region. Overall, this project has the potential to offer valuable insights into the root causes of land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration in the West African Sahel, ultimately contributing to more effective and sustainable interventions in this complex and dynamic context.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel\", aims to investigate the complex interplay between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration in the context of the West African Sahel region, with a specific focus on Mali. The project will target farmers and pastoralists as key groups affected by land dispossession, exploring the hypothesis that dispossessed smallholders are more likely to migrate or resist violently, with potential links to the rise of 'jihadist' groups.\n\nUtilizing a mixed methods approach and drawing on theoretical frameworks such as political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, the project's objectives include investigating the relationship between land dispossession, resistance, and migration, as well as assessing the factors that influence smallholders' decisions to resist violently or comply.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, as well as ideas for policy formulation to address these complex issues. By shedding light on the mechanisms driving land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration in the Sahel region, this project has the potential to inform more effective and targeted interventions to promote peace and stability in the region.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"New Perspectives on Land Dispossession, Violent Conflict and Migration in the West African Sahel.\" The focus region of the study is the West African Sahel, with a specific case study country being Mali. The target groups of the project are farmers and pastoralists who are affected by land dispossession. The central issue being addressed is the impact of land dispossession on migration and violent resistance, particularly in the context of the rise of 'jihadist' groups.\n\nThe project aims to investigate the link between land dispossession, violent resistance, and migration, as well as to assess why some smallholders choose to resist violently while others remain compliant. The methodology employed will be mixed methods, drawing on theoretical frameworks from political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include novel insights into smallholder motivations and agency, new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts, and migration, and ideas for policy formulation. By examining the hypothesized relationship between land dispossession, elite capture, violent jihadist resistance, and migration, this project will contribute valuable insights to the understanding of conflict dynamics in the West African Sahel."
