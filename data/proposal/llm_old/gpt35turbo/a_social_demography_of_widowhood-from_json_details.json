        "The grant proposal titled \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies\" aims to address the increasing relevance of widowhood in ageing societies where survival benefits for widows are being cut in many countries. Despite the prevalence of widowhood, research in this area is underdeveloped compared to divorce. This project will take an innovative approach by focusing on the probability and duration of risk, as well as the mental health and economic consequences of vulnerability in widowhood.\n\nThe project will explore the impact of widowhood on social inequalities by examining factors such as socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age. By analyzing country differences and changes over time from 1985 to 2050, the research outcomes will provide systematic and comprehensive estimates that shed light on the challenges facing widowed populations and their family members.\n\nUtilizing high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources with harmonization, as well as advanced statistical methods, this project aims to cover 60 countries and provide new insights that can facilitate the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems. By establishing a social demography of widowhood, this project will contribute to filling the current gaps in research and understanding the complexities of widowhood in ageing societies.",
        "The proposed project, \"A Social Demography of Widowhood across Ageing Societies,\" aims to address the increasing relevance of widowhood in ageing societies, where survival benefits are being cut in many countries. This research project seeks to fill the gap in the underdeveloped area of widowhood studies compared to divorce, with a focus on innovative approaches. The conceptual approach of the project includes assessing the risk and vulnerability factors related to widowhood, such as probability, duration, mental health, and economic consequences. \n\nThe project will overcome current assessments limitations by examining changes in wellbeing after bereavement, shifting the focus from unexpected deaths to the prevalent scenario of terminal health decline before death. It will explore the pillars of risk and vulnerability, social inequalities by various factors, country differences, and changes over time using high-quality, harmonized data and advanced statistical methods. With a wide country coverage of 60 countries and a time span from 1985 to 2050, the research outcome is expected to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates, insights into the challenges faced by widowed populations and their families, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems. This project will establish a foundational understanding of the social demography of widowhood, contributing valuable insights to policy and practice in ageing societies.",
