        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the historical origins and development of global psyche and transcultural psychiatry concepts in the aftermath of the Second World War and during decolonization. The project aims to investigate the universality and cross-cultural applications of mental health notions, analyze the colonial and post-colonial roots of the global mental health movement, and provide a systematic account of the decolonization of psychiatry and mental health sciences. Through an inter-disciplinary and historical analysis approach, the research will focus on key concepts such as global psyche, transcultural psychiatry, and decolonization.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the definition of universal psychological mechanisms, fostering an inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities, and developing new cross-cultural models of the mind. By addressing research questions related to the redefinition of culture, race, and individual psyche post-WWII and post-colonialism, exploring the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe, and evaluating the departure from colonial frameworks in global and transcultural psychiatry, this project aims to bridge the gap between Western and non-Western mental health communities. Ultimately, the research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical context and implications of decolonizing madness in the field of psychiatry and mental health sciences.",
