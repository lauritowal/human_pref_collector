        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the drivers of growth in bank lending and their relationship to financial crises. The project, titled \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to address the lack of decisive empirical evidence on the impact of various factors on credit growth. The proposal focuses on phenomena such as banking crises and the negative externalities that can arise from financial to macro real sectors. \n\nThe project will analyze a range of ingredients, including financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending booms, real estate price booms, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios. By utilizing exceptional micro-level datasets and appropriate methodologies, the research team plans to identify and estimate the impact of each factor on loan growth. \n\nThe complexity of the global banking system and the lack of micro-level data present significant challenges that the project aims to overcome. Through empirical analysis and theoretical frameworks, the research will provide a deeper understanding of the potential combinations of ingredients that drive credit growth. The external validity of the findings will be ensured by the unique settings of individual datasets and methodologies employed. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discussion on tightening financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension in response to banking crises.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to investigate the factors influencing credit growth in the context of banking crises. With a strong focus on phenomena such as banking crises and the consensus to tighten financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension, the project seeks to address the negative externalities that can arise from financial to macro real sectors. \n\nThe project will analyze various ingredients such as financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending boom, real estate price boom, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios to understand their impact on credit growth. Despite lacking decisive empirical evidence, the project will utilize exceptional micro-level datasets and appropriate methodologies to identify and estimate the impact of each factor on loan growth. \n\nThe theoretical framework will be provided where missing, and potential combinations of ingredients will be assessed to ensure external validity. The project's objective is to provide empirical identification of individual ingredients' impact on credit, addressing the challenge posed by the global banking system complexity and the lack of micro-level data. By focusing on credit growth and utilizing unique datasets, this project aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of financial regulation and crisis management.",
        "The proposed project, \"Drivers of Growth in Bank Lending and Financial Crises,\" aims to investigate the key factors influencing bank lending growth and their potential impact on financial crises. The project will focus on phenomena such as banking crises, strong credit growth, and the consensus to tighten financial regulation with a macroprudential dimension. The negative externalities from financial to macro real sectors will be examined, with a particular emphasis on financial innovations, loan securitization, mortgage lending booms, real estate price booms, lack of borrower information, high leverage, and low capital ratios.\n\nThe project will address the challenge of lacking decisive empirical evidence by conducting an empirical analysis to identify and estimate the impact of individual factors on loan growth. The methodology will be appropriate, utilizing exceptional micro-level datasets and providing a theoretical framework when missing. The project will also assess potential combinations of ingredients and ensure external validity through individual dataset settings and methodologies.\n\nBy gaining a deeper understanding of the drivers of bank lending growth and their implications for financial stability, this project has the potential to inform policymakers and regulators on strategies to mitigate the risk of financial crises. The findings from this research will contribute to the existing literature on financial stability and have practical implications for the global banking system."
