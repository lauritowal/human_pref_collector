        "The proposed project, titled \"Transnational histories of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850)\", aims to delve into the intricate web of political, professional, and personal motivations that shaped the region during the specified time period. Focusing on themes such as corruption, political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, the project seeks to assess the impact of foreign observers and indigenous critics on the region's development.\n\nBy examining the linkages between cultural backwardness and economic under-development, the project aims to demonstrate the reframing of customs as corrupt and explore the impacts of Great Power interventions. Through this exploration, the project seeks to trace the genealogy of ideas and attitudes surrounding corruption in Central-South-East Europe.\n\nThe academic contribution of this project lies in its dialogue with global modernization, alignment of historiography with scientific innovations, reframing of debates on patronage and graft, and reconfiguration of center-periphery relations understanding. Ultimately, \"TransCorr\" seeks to construct a comprehensive history of the idea of 'corruption' in the region, shedding light on the factors that influenced the development of more honest and efficient administrations, effective military regimes, and superior commercial operations.",
        "The Transnational Histories of 'Corruption' in Central-South-East Europe (1750-1850) project, known as TransCorr, aims to explore the complex interplay of corruption, political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery during the period from 1750 to 1850 in Central-South-East Europe. By examining the motivations, claims, and linkages associated with corruption in this region, the project seeks to shed light on the impact of Great Power interventions and the evolution of ideas and attitudes towards corruption.\n\nTransCorr will contribute to the academic discourse by providing a comprehensive history of the concept of corruption, reframing customs as corrupt, and examining the effects of corruption on various aspects of society, including administration, military regimes, and commercial operations. Through dialogue with global modernization theories and scientific innovations, the project aims to reframe debates on patronage and graft, while also reconfiguring our understanding of center-periphery relations.\n\nWith a focus on engaging both foreign observers and indigenous critics, TransCorr will offer a nuanced perspective on the historical development of corruption in Central-South-East Europe. By tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes towards corruption, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into the socio-political dynamics of the region during this critical period of transition towards modernity.",
        "The TransCorr project aims to investigate the transnational histories of 'corruption' in Central-South-East Europe from 1750 to 1850. By examining themes such as corruption, political space, graft, nepotism, and bribery, the project seeks to assess the impact of foreign observers and indigenous critics on the region during this time period. Motivated by political, professional, and personal interests, the project aims to uncover how notions of corruption influenced the development of administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations in the region.\n\nThrough exploring linkages to cultural backwardness and economic under-development, the project aims to construct a history of the idea of 'corruption' and demonstrate the reframing of customs as corrupt. By tracing the genealogy of ideas and attitudes, the project seeks to contribute to the dialogue on global modernization and align historiography with scientific innovations. Additionally, the project aims to reframe debates on patronage and graft, as well as reconfigure the understanding of center-periphery relations.\n\nUltimately, the TransCorr project aspires to shed light on the complex historical dynamics surrounding corruption in Central-South-East Europe and provide valuable insights into the region's development during this critical period of transition to modernity."
