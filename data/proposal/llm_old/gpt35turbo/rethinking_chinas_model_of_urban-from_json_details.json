        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance\", which holds world-historical significance. The project aims to address both theoretical and policy challenges through investigating various scales of urban governance in China, including neighbourhoods, cities, and regions. The research will be conducted using ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers. \n\nThe project will focus on case studies in key regions such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, covering coastal, central, and western regions of China. It will also examine recent national strategic projects in the context of the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and ongoing trade tensions. \n\nThe proposed project will contribute to the development of a new theory of entrepreneurial urban governance and provide an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. The outputs of the project will include six workshops and a publication series. Ultimately, this project aims to change existing perceptions of China's governance by offering a nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in the country.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Rethinking China’s Model of Urban Governance\" aims to investigate the world-historical significance of China's urban governance model. The project will address both theoretical and policy challenges through a multi-scale investigation that includes neighbourhoods, cities, and regions. Utilizing ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and engagement with Chinese researchers and policymakers, the study will focus on case studies in key regions such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. The project will cover coastal, central, and western regions and examine recent national strategic projects. \n\nWith the timeliness of the UN-endorsed new urban agenda and trade tensions, this project will provide a fresh perspective on state entrepreneurialism in China. The proposed outputs include six workshops and a publication series. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the development of a new theoretical framework for understanding China's urban governance, offering an indigenous perspective on Chinese urban transformation. By providing a nuanced explanation of China's state entrepreneurialism, this project will challenge existing paradigms and reshape our understanding of governance in China.",
