        "The grant proposal titled \"Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols\" aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying learning in infants, focusing on language acquisition and complex social interactions. The project will utilize human cerebral architecture and provide access to a rich symbolic system to study infants from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life. The research will involve six work packages, each focusing on different aspects of infant learning, such as age statistical inferences, the impact of pre-term environments, word meaning and category inference, symbolic competency criteria, functional localization using MRI, and the development of new tools for brain image analysis. Techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography will be employed to gather data throughout the study period.\n\nThe primary goal of the project is to clarify the specific neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits. By understanding how infants process and learn from their environment, the research aims to contribute valuable insights into early cognitive development and inform interventions for children at risk for learning disorders. The results of this study have the potential to advance our understanding of infant learning and lay the foundation for future research in developmental neuroscience.",

        "The grant proposal titled \"Neural mechanisms of learning in the infant brain: from Statistics to Rules and Symbols\" aims to investigate the intricate processes involved in early learning in infants, particularly focusing on language development and complex social interactions. The project will utilize human cerebral architecture and provide access to a rich symbolic system to explore the neural mechanisms underlying these crucial developmental milestones.\n\nThe proposed project will consist of six work packages, each employing techniques such as EEG, MRI, and optical topography. The study period will span from 6 months of gestation to the end of the first year of life, covering key developmental stages in infant brain development.\n\nSpecific objectives of the project include investigating age-related statistical inferences, exploring the effects of pre-term environments on early statistical computations, examining the neural bases of word meaning and category inference, and evaluating infant symbolic competency criteria. The project will also focus on functional localization and maturational markers using MRI, as well as the development of new tools for multimodal brain image analysis.\n\nOverall, this project aims to clarify the specific neural functional architecture critical for human learning from the onset of cortical circuits, providing valuable insights into the early stages of cognitive development in infants."
