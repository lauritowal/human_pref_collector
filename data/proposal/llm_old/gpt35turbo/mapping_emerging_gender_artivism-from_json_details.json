        "The \"Mapping Emerging Gender Artivism in the Mediterranean Arab Public Space\" (MEGAMAPS) project focuses on artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, specifically after the 2011 uprisings in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. The project aims to innovate global academic knowledge on the Arab region by utilizing methodologies such as history, social movements theory, gender studies, visual arts, and digital humanities. \n\nKey objectives include investigating the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change, as well as framing, exploring, and mapping emerging artivism for gender equality. The project will produce an open-access participative digital platform and document a corpus of living sources using fieldwork and digital ethnography. The living sources include visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, maps, and graphic tools.\n\nThe project also aims to disseminate its findings by improving activists' participation in transnational networks, promoting mutual exchanges of best practices, and proposing an agency paradigm to overcome orientalism and Islamophobia. The target audiences for this project include academics, stakeholders, and the general public.\n\nIn summary, MEGAMAPS is a transnational and in-depth study that seeks to advance academic knowledge on artivism for gender equality in the Mediterranean Arab public space, while also creating a participative digital platform for research and exchange.",
        "The \"Mapping Emerging Gender Artivism in the Mediterranean Arab Public Space\" (MEGAMAPS) project focuses on the post-uprising period after 2011 in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. This project will utilize a multidisciplinary methodology including History, Social Movements Theory, Gender studies, Visual Arts, and Digital Humanities to investigate the interplay between gender, public aesthetic dissent, and social change in the Arab region. The objectives of the project include innovating global academic knowledge, framing and mapping emerging Artivism for gender equality, and providing a research platform accessible to various audiences.\n\nThrough fieldwork and digital ethnography, the project will document and systematize living sources such as visual and performative arts, oral interviews, cartographies, maps, and graphic tools. A key output of the project will be an open access participative digital platform featuring FAIR accessibility to promote mutual exchanges of best practices and overcome orientalism and islamophobia. Target audiences for the project include academics, stakeholders, and the general public.\n\nOverall, MEGAMAPS aims to contribute to reversing the victimization paradigm on women and sexual minorities in the Mediterranean Arab public space and propose an agency paradigm for social change. This project represents a significant opportunity to enhance understanding and engagement with Artivism for gender equality in the region.",
