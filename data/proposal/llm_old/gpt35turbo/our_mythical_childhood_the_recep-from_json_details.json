        "The grant proposal \"Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children’s and Young Adults’ Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges\" aims to develop a pioneering approach to understanding how Classical Antiquity is received and reshaped in children's and young adults' culture. The project seeks to offer insights into identity formation and initiation into adulthood, exploring the reception of Antiquity as influenced by regional and global challenges. \n\nThe proposed project addresses limitations in current research, which often focuses solely on Western culture, by applying regional perspectives without bias and conducting comparative studies across Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and Asia. The innovative approach of comparing reception models across various regions, including non-traditional ones for the Graeco-Roman tradition, sets this project apart.\n\nBy examining the influence of popular culture on Classical Antiquity and analyzing key social, political, and cultural transformations, the research team, comprising an international group of scholars, aims to make a broad impact on scholarship, education, and culture. The project's deliverables include a supra-regional survey of classical references, analyses of crucial reception cases, and materials on ancient myths for work with disabled children.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to contribute to integration and stimulate cultural exchange by deepening our understanding of how Classical Antiquity is received and reshaped in children's and young adults' culture across different regions, addressing both regional and global challenges.",
