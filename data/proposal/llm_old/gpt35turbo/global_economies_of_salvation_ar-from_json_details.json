        "The \"Global Economies of Salvation\" grant proposal aims to delve into the intricate relationship between art and the negotiation of sanctity in the Early Modern period. Focusing on the post-Tridentine era, the project seeks to unravel the role of artworks in the interaction between the Catholic Church and Protestants, particularly in the context of the Roman Curia and Iberian hegemony. By examining neglected areas such as local constructions of sanctity and the representation of blesseds and saints in Iberian empires, the research hypothesizes that artworks serve as a window into the negotiation of spiritual status within Catholic communities.\n\nThrough a methodology that involves tracing the circulation of material objects, analyzing iconographies, and exploring global networks of knowledge transmission, this project will contribute to a globalizing history of early modern art. It aims to challenge prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. By shedding light on how artworks were utilized for self-representation and social identity formation, this research will affirm the role of art in society's production of saints. Ultimately, the theoretical framework of a global market of symbolic values, coupled with disciplines such as critical sociology, will offer a fresh perspective on the dynamics of sanctity negotiation in a global context.",
        "The \"Global Economies of Salvation\" project seeks to explore the intricate relationship between art and the negotiation of sanctity in the Early Modern Period, specifically focusing on the post-Tridentine era within a global context. The research project, GLOBECOSAL, delves into the ways in which artworks were utilized to negotiate spiritual status within Catholic communities, particularly in relation to the Roman Curia and under the dominance of Iberian hegemony. By examining the production of artworks depicting Catholic blesseds and saints, the study aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms of adherence to Tridentine models of sanctity, while shedding light on neglected areas such as local constructions of sanctity within the Iberian empires.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates critical sociology, the project will analyze the circulation of material objects, iconographies, and global networks of knowledge transmission. The theoretical framework of a global market of symbolic values will guide the investigation, ultimately contributing to a globalized history of early modern art and challenging prevailing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. By revealing how artworks served as tools for self-representation and social identity formation, this project aims to affirm the role of society in the production of saints, thereby enriching our understanding of the complexities of art and sanctity in a global context.",
        "The proposed project, \"Global Economies of Salvation: Art and the Negotiation of Sanctity in the Early Modern Period,\" seeks to examine the role of artworks in negotiating spiritual status within Catholic communities during the post-Tridentine era of global influence. Focusing on the Roman Curia and Iberian hegemony, the research project, GLOBECOSAL, delves into the intersection of art, sanctity, and power dynamics in a global context. By analyzing the production and circulation of artworks related to Catholic blesseds and saints, the study aims to shed light on how these visual representations were used for self-representation and social identity formation.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach that includes critical sociology and methodologies such as tracing material objects and global networks of knowledge transmission, the project seeks to challenge existing perspectives on Roman Catholicism, colonialism, and the early modern world. By uncovering neglected areas such as local constructions of sanctity and the role of blesseds and saints in Iberian empires, the research project aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the global market of symbolic values in the early modern period. Ultimately, this study aims to affirm the agency of societies in producing saints and reshape the discourse on the negotiation of sanctity through art in a global context."
