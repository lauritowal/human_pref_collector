        "The proposed project, titled \"Representational preconditions for understanding other minds in the service of human collaboration and social learning,\" aims to explore the empirical implications of a new theoretical approach to the early representational preconditions and functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. The project seeks to challenge the traditional view that representing others' beliefs is effortful and late developing, proposing instead that mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Motivated by recent evidence showing infants' understanding of mental states by the second year, the research will investigate cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, with a focus on the automatic processes involved in social interactions.\n\nThe research goals include exploring the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, charting the developmental unfolding of these abilities, and investigating the implications of the proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions. Building on previous findings that mechanisms for understanding others' mental states are present as early as 7 months of age and that both infants and adults automatically compute others' beliefs even when not required, this project aims to contribute to a paradigm shift in our understanding of social cognition. Key references include works by Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and Kovacs et al. (in press Science).",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Representational Preconditions for Understanding Other Minds in the Service of Human Collaboration and Social Learning,\" aims to explore the empirical implications of a novel theoretical approach to early representational preconditions and the functional structure of mechanisms for understanding other minds. The project seeks to challenge existing theories that view representing others' beliefs as effortful and late developing, with the main function being to explain others' behavior. Instead, the project proposes a new theoretical perspective that suggests mental state monitoring and representation are automatic and effortless, grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions.\n\nMotivated by recent evidence showing infants understand mental states by the second year of life, the project will investigate cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying social mind functions, with a specific focus on the automatic processes involved in social interactions. The research goals include exploring the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of infants' belief computation abilities, charting the developmental unfolding of these abilities, and investigating the implications of the proposal that the system's proper domain is collaborative and communicative interactions.\n\nDrawing on key references such as Wellman et al. (2001), Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), and Kovacs et al. (in press Science), this project brings a fresh perspective to the field of social cognition and offers the potential for paradigm-shifting insights into the early development of mechanisms for understanding other minds.",
