        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes, utilizing Esping-Andersen’s 'three worlds' framework. The focus of the study will be on gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use in regions including China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, with comparative aspects between East Asian and Western societies. Key concepts such as unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, public policies, gender division of labour, social inequality, modern technology, care provision, domestic labour, leisure time, and enjoyment will be examined. \n\nThe analysis will involve cross-national and historical comparative approaches, drawing on data sources such as time diary data and household panel data. The study will operate at multiple levels, including the household, societal, and life course levels. By exploring how gender inequality is shaped by welfare regimes and time use, the research aims to shed light on the impact of these factors on family outcomes. \n\nOverall, this project will contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay between gender, time use, and welfare systems in shaping social inequalities. The findings from this study have the potential to inform policy makers, researchers, and practitioners on strategies to address and reduce gender disparities in different societal contexts.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes, utilizing Esping-Andersen’s 'three worlds' framework. The focus of the project includes gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use, with a specific emphasis on regions such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. By comparing East Asian and Western societies, the study aims to explore key concepts such as unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, public policies, gender division of labour, social inequality, modern technology, care provision, domestic labour, leisure time, and enjoyment.\n\nEmploying cross-national and historical comparative analysis types, the research will draw on data from time diary data and household panel data at various study levels including household, societal, and life course. The ultimate goal of this study is to analyze how gender inequality is influenced by different welfare regimes, particularly focusing on time use and its impact on family outcomes. By shedding light on the relationship between gender roles, time allocation, and welfare policies, this project has the potential to inform future policy-making and contribute to reducing gender disparities in both Asian and Western societies.",
        "The proposed project, \"Temporal structures of gender inequalities in Asian and Western welfare regimes\", aims to investigate the impact of welfare regimes on gender inequalities in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, in comparison to Western societies. Utilizing Esping-Andersen’s 'three worlds' framework, the study will focus on gender roles, welfare regimes, and time use, with a specific emphasis on unpaid work, daily activities, life schedules, and public policies. \n\nThrough a cross-national and historical comparative analysis, the project will draw on data sources such as time diary data and household panel data to examine the gender division of labour, social inequality, and the influence of modern technology on care provision, domestic labour, leisure time, and enjoyment. The study will operate at multiple levels, including the household, societal, and life course, to understand how temporal structures shape family outcomes and perpetuate gender disparities.\n\nThe findings from this research will contribute to the existing literature on gender inequalities and welfare regimes, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in designing effective strategies to address social inequalities. By shedding light on the complex interplay between time use, gender roles, and welfare policies, this project has the potential to inform more equitable and inclusive public policies that promote gender equality and social well-being across diverse cultural contexts."
