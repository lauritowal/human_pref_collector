        "The grant proposal, titled \"The role of consciousness in adaptive behavior: A combined empirical, computational and robot based approach,\" aims to investigate the functional role of consciousness in adaptive behavior through the Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC) project. The project will utilize empirical, computational, and robot-based approaches to address the paradox of consciousness and action, identify neuronal principles of consciousness, and construct a neuromorphic robot-based real-time conscious architecture. The hypothesis posits that a shift to an intentional agent-dominated world requires different control architectures, such as parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operation and a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene. The project outcomes include advancing frameworks beyond the current state of the art, developing system-level models of conscious architecture, conducting computational studies of neuronal substrate, and validating findings with both humanoid robots and stroke patients. The proposed research is relevant for addressing questions about the function and genesis of consciousness, advancing understanding of the mind and brain, developing new neurorehabilitation technologies, and contributing to the creation of a new generation of robots with advanced social competence. This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of consciousness in adaptive behavior within a multidisciplinary context.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of consciousness in adaptive behavior through a comprehensive approach combining empirical studies, computational modeling, and robot-based experiments. The project, titled \"Conscious Distributed Adaptive Control (CDAC),\" aims to resolve the paradox of consciousness and action by identifying the neuronal principles underlying consciousness and constructing a neuromorphic robot-based conscious architecture in real-time. The hypothesis driving this research is that a shift towards an intentional agent-dominated world necessitates distinct control architectures. \n\nThe project will focus on developing parallel and distributed control loops for real-time operations, as well as a second level of control for coherence and conscious scene. The functions of the conscious scene, such as credit assignment and planning beyond immediate information, will be explored to understand their role in adaptive behavior. The outcomes of this project are expected to include a framework that advances beyond the current state of the art, system-level models of conscious architecture, computational studies on the neuronal substrate, and empirical validation with both humanoid robots and stroke patients.\n\nThis research is significant as it addresses fundamental questions about the function and genesis of consciousness, advances our understanding of the mind and brain, provides new neurorehabilitation technologies, and contributes to developing a new generation of robots with advanced social competence. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will provide a holistic understanding of the role of consciousness in adaptive behavior.",
