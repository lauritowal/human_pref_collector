        "The proposed project, titled \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence,\" aims to pioneer a new research agenda focusing on the individual-level dynamics that underpin collective defence within key NATO member states. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, the project seeks to investigate how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in various collective defence scenarios. The study will also explore how these individual attitudes aggregate to shape public opinion, which in turn influences decision-makers in allied states.\n\nKey hypotheses include the impact of strategic context on public opinion formation, the limited role of public opinion in conventional direct armed aggression scenarios, and the heightened relevance of public opinion in ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts. To test these hypotheses, the project will utilize novel immersive mixed-media experiments to provide participants with an interactive, engaging, and realistic experience.\n\nThe potential policy implications of this research are significant, as the findings could potentially redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances. By shedding light on the microfoundations of collective defence, this project has the potential to inform future policy decisions and enhance the effectiveness of international security cooperation.",
        "The \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence\" grant proposal seeks to pioneer a new research agenda focused on understanding the individual-level mechanisms that underpin collective defence within key NATO member states. The project aims to investigate how individuals form attitudes towards allied assistance in various collective defence scenarios, how these individual attitudes aggregate to shape public opinion, and ultimately, how public opinion influences decision-makers in allied states. \n\nUsing a multi-disciplinary approach that incorporates experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology, the research will explore the impact of different strategic contexts on public opinion formation and decision-making. Hypotheses to be tested include the influence of strategic context on public opinion, the role of public opinion in scenarios of direct armed aggression, and the implications of \"grey zone\" conflicts on public opinion polarization and policy-making.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project will employ innovative immersive mixed-media experiments that provide participants with interactive, engaging, and realistic experiences. The findings from this research have the potential to reshape our understanding of the stability and credibility of military alliances, with direct policy implications for decision-makers in allied states. Through this groundbreaking work, the \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence\" project aims to significantly advance our knowledge of collective defence mechanisms and their impact on international security.",
        "The \"Microfoundations of Collective Defence\" grant proposal seeks to launch a pioneering research initiative delving into the individual-level dynamics that underpin collective defence mechanisms in key NATO member states. This project aims to inaugurate a novel research agenda by conducting an extensive, cross-national investigation utilizing experimental political science, international relations, and political psychology methodologies.\n\nThe primary focus of this project is on understanding how individual attitudes towards allied assistance in various collective defence scenarios shape public opinion, which in turn influences decision-makers within allied states. Theoretical components include the formation of attitudes, aggregation of individual opinions, and the impact of public opinion on policy-making.\n\nUnique methodological innovations will involve immersive mixed-media experiments to provide participants with interactive, engaging, and realistic experiences. Hypotheses to be tested include the impact of strategic context on public opinion formation, the role of public opinion in direct armed aggression scenarios, and the polarization of public opinion in ambiguous \"grey zone\" conflicts.\n\nThe potential policy implications of this research are significant, as the findings could redefine the stability and credibility of military alliances. By shedding light on the microfoundations of collective defence, this project has the potential to shape future policy decisions and enhance the effectiveness of international security mechanisms."
