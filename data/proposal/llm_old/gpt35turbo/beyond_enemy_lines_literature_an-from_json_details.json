        "The proposed project, \"Beyond Enemy Lines: Literature and Film in the British and American Zones of Occupied Germany, 1945-1949,\" aims to conduct the first detailed survey of the cultural landscape in the British and American zones of Occupied Germany. By investigating the cross-fertilisation of Anglo/American and German literature and film, the project seeks to provide a new interpretative framework for postwar culture and contribute to the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining literature and film history, critical analysis, cultural history, and life-writing, this study will explore the intertwining of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature and the relationship between postwar culture and the Cold War. This project's ambition is to open up a major new field of research within a timeframe of 1945-1949 in the British and American zones of Occupied Germany.",
