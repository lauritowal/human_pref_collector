        "The proposed project titled \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\" aims to revolutionize the field by developing methodologies for analyzing unstructured texts in a GIS environment. Led by a Principal Investigator with expertise in Digital Humanities and Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS), the project will focus on two main studies: one investigating the English Lake District across different time periods, and another exploring the mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales.\n\nThrough a combination of GIS and Corpus Linguistics methodologies, the project seeks to answer the research question: \"How can textual sources within a GIS broaden our understanding of the humanities?\" The interdisciplinary nature of the project involves disciplines such as HGIS, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History. The project will have a major impact within the humanities and beyond, with applications ranging from ancient manuscripts to modern newspapers and e-resources.\n\nTo achieve its goals, the project will engage in various outreach activities including short courses, expert meetings, and conferences. By bridging the gap between GIS and the Digital Humanities, this project has the potential to redefine the Spatial Humanities and contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge in this area.",
        "The \"Bringing GIS to the Digital Humanities: Defining the Spatial Humanities\" grant proposal aims to bridge the gap between the fields of Historical Geographical Information Systems (HGIS) and Digital Humanities. The Principal Investigator has extensive experience in both areas, making this project uniquely positioned to develop methodologies for analyzing unstructured texts in a GIS environment using GIS and Corpus Linguistics.\n\nThe project will focus on two key studies: the English Lake District across different time periods and the mortality decline in 19th and early 20th century England & Wales, exploring themes such as socio-economic changes and political interventions. Through short courses, expert meetings, and conferences, the project will engage with scholars across disciplines including HGIS, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, Literary Studies, and History.\n\nThe overarching research question driving this proposal is: \"How can textual sources within a GIS broaden our understanding of the humanities?\" By applying these methodologies to a diverse range of sources including ancient manuscripts, modern newspapers, and e-resources, the project aims to have a major impact within the humanities and beyond. This innovative approach has the potential to reshape how we study and interpret historical texts, opening up new avenues for interdisciplinary research and collaboration.",
