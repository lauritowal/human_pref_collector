        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History,\" also known as NUCLEARWATERS. The project aims to explore the history of nuclear energy through the lens of water, arguing that nuclear energy is fundamentally a hydraulic technology. By examining centuries of hydraulic engineering and the role of water in hydraulic civilizations, the project will investigate historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions.\n\nThe hypothesis of the project is that a water-centred history can resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history. The investigation will be structured into six work packages focusing on themes such as the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, the Soviet Union's nuclear waters, the nuclearized river basin of the Rhine Valley, Japan's atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nThe ambition of the project is to revise the history of nuclear energy, with implications for the history of technology field, environmental history, and the public debate on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. By shedding light on the interconnectedness of water and nuclear energy, this project aims to provide a new perspective on the history of nuclear technology and its implications for society.",
        "The grant proposal \"Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History\" seeks to explore the interconnected history of nuclear energy and water, under the project name NUCLEARWATERS. The approach taken is novel, focusing on the idea that nuclear energy can be viewed as a hydraulic technology, with a historical context rooted in centuries of hydraulic engineering and hydraulic civilizations.\n\nThe project aims to investigate various areas related to historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions, with the hypothesis that a water-centred history can help unravel key mysteries in nuclear energy history. Through six work packages, the project will delve into themes such as the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, the Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nThe ambition of this project is to revise the existing narrative of nuclear energy history, with implications for the history of technology field, environmental history, and public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. By shedding light on the intricate relationship between water and nuclear energy, this project aims to provide a fresh perspective on the development and impact of nuclear technology on society and the environment.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"Putting Water at the Centre of Nuclear Energy History\" under the name NUCLEARWATERS. The project will take a new approach to examining the history of nuclear energy by focusing on the relationship between nuclear technology and water. The argument put forth is that nuclear energy can be seen as a hydraulic technology, with centuries of hydraulic engineering and hydraulic civilizations shaping its development.\n\nThe project aims to investigate historical water-manipulating technologies and wet and dry risk conceptions to support the hypothesis that a water-centred history can resolve key riddles in nuclear energy history. The research will be organized into six work packages that will explore themes such as the nuclear-hydraulic engineering community, Soviet Union nuclear waters, Rhine Valley nuclearized river basin, Japan atomic coastscapes, and the Baltic Sea region.\n\nThe ambition of this project is to revise the existing narrative of nuclear energy history, with implications for the history of technology field, environmental history, and public debates on nuclear energy in Europe and beyond. By shedding light on the role of water in the development of nuclear energy, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intertwined histories of technology and the environment."
