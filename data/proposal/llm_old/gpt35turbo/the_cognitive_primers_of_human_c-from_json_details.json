    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, \"The cognitive primers of human culture: a comparative approach to the emergence of innovations\", aims to investigate the conditions that drive innovations across primates, with a specific focus on the creation and use of sharp stone tools (flakes) and their significance in human cultural development. The study will involve defining the baseline stone manipulation propensities of chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques using artificial intelligence coding methods. It will also test the roles of exposure and experience as drivers of innovations through an experimental paradigm with large sample sizes and long-term testing protocols. By comparing primate assemblages to the oldest human stone tools, the project seeks to infer when cognitive capacities diverged between humans and other primates.\n\nThe project will employ a triangulation approach, artificial intelligence coding methods, an experimental paradigm with controls, large sample sizes (N=350), and long-term testing protocols over approximately 4 years. Additionally, Structural Equation Models will be used to analyze the data. By studying chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques in relation to sharp stone tool creation and usage, this research will provide an enhanced understanding of the conditions required for innovations and shed light on the primers of human culture.",
