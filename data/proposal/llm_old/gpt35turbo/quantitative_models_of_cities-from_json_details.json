        "The \"Quantitative Models of Cities\" grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of economic divergence across countries, within countries, and between urban and rural areas. Focused on the 20th century, the project will leverage high-resolution data and recent theoretical breakthroughs to develop dynamic models that incorporate worker and firm heterogeneity. By combining quantitative models with detailed Danish data, the research team will address policy-relevant questions related to urban transport infrastructure, the effect of height restrictions, and the impact of planning interventions on cities.\n\nBuilding on key references such as Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding and Sturm (2020), the project's innovations lie in its comprehensive approach to integrating quantitative models with real-world data. This will enable researchers to gain insights into the complex dynamics of urban economies and provide valuable input for policymakers.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary collaboration, the \"Quantitative Models of Cities\" project seeks to push the boundaries of urban economics research and contribute to evidence-based policy-making in city planning and development. With a focus on both historical trends and recent changes, the proposed research has the potential to generate novel findings that will advance our understanding of urban economic dynamics and inform effective policy interventions.",
        "The \"Quantitative Models of Cities\" grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of economic divergence across countries, within countries, and between cities and rural areas. Focusing on the niche interest of 20th-century urban dynamics, the project will leverage high-resolution data and theoretical breakthroughs to develop innovative quantitative models. Drawing on key references such as Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm (2020), the project will combine quantitative models with register data, develop dynamic models, use detailed Danish data, and incorporate worker and firm heterogeneity.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to address policy-relevant questions related to urban transport infrastructure, the effects of height restrictions, and planning interventions on cities. By integrating cutting-edge quantitative techniques with rich empirical data, this project has the potential to generate insights that can inform policy decisions and urban development strategies. The interdisciplinary nature of the research, combining economics, geography, and urban planning, will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics shaping cities. Ultimately, the project aspires to contribute to the advancement of urban studies and provide valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners seeking to create sustainable and prosperous cities.",
        "The \"Quantitative Models of Cities\" grant proposal aims to explore economic divergence within and across countries, as well as between urban and rural areas, with a focus on 20th-century historical niche interest. The project will leverage high-resolution data and recent theoretical breakthroughs to develop innovative quantitative models that integrate register data and dynamic modeling techniques. Drawing on key references such as Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, Wolf (2015) and Heblich, Redding, Sturm (2020), the project will use detailed Danish data to account for worker and firm heterogeneity.\n\nThe proposed project stands out for its unique approach to combining quantitative models with register data, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of urban economic dynamics. By addressing policy-relevant questions related to urban transport infrastructure, the effects of height restrictions, and planning interventions on cities, the project aims to inform evidence-based policy-making and urban planning strategies. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, drawing on insights from economics, geography, and urban studies, promises to yield valuable insights into the complex dynamics of urban economies. Overall, the project represents a timely and innovative contribution to the field of urban economics and has the potential to inform policy decisions that shape the future of cities."
