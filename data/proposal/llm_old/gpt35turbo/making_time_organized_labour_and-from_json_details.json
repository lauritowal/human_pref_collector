        "The grant proposal \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave\" seeks to address the crucial issue of promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe. With a focus on social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time, the project aims to develop statutory care-related leave rights and protections in collaboration with trade unions. Recognizing the gendered aspect of caregiving and union membership, the research design will employ a mixed-method approach, including quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis will span rich democracies from 1965 onwards, while the qualitative analysis will focus on Ireland, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe project will investigate union influence mechanisms in the development of policies such as child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. By examining these policies in different institutional settings, the study aims to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships. The development of a longitudinal, comparative data infrastructure on care leave provisions will enable the assessment of organized labour's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. This project holds the potential to drive policy change and enhance the well-being of workers in Europe.",
        "The grant proposal, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" aims to address the pressing need for promoting work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe. Focusing on social policies for sustainable work through family and self-care time, the project will specifically explore the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections by trade unions. Given the gendered aspect of women's predominance in caregiving and union membership, this research will employ a mixed-method approach including quantitative and qualitative analyses in rich democracies starting from 1965. The qualitative analysis will focus on Ireland, France, and the Netherlands, examining various care leave policies such as child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits. By investigating union influence mechanisms in different institutional settings, the project seeks to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships. The development of longitudinal, comparative data on care leave provisions will contribute to understanding organized labour's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform policy decisions and enhance work-life balance for individuals in Europe and beyond.",
        "The proposed project, \"Making Time: Organized Labour and the Politics of Care Leave,\" aims to promote work-life balance and policy innovation in Europe by focusing on the development of statutory care-related leave rights and protections. With a particular emphasis on the gendered aspect of caregiving and union membership, the project will utilize a mixed-method research design incorporating quantitative and qualitative analysis. \n\nThe quantitative analysis will span rich democracies from 1965 onwards, while the qualitative analysis will focus on Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. The project will investigate union influence mechanisms in the context of different institutional settings, drawing on interdisciplinary fields such as comparative policy analysis and social movement research. \n\nBy examining various policy areas such as child care leave, aging parent care leave, spousal care leave, sick leave, and disability benefits, the project aims to advance comparative labour studies and develop theories of union-policy relationships. Longitudinal, comparative data on care leave provisions will be developed to assess organized labour's role as a partner in developing sustainable work policies. \n\nOverall, this project seeks to contribute to the development of social policies that support sustainable work through family and self-care time, ultimately benefiting both workers and their families."
