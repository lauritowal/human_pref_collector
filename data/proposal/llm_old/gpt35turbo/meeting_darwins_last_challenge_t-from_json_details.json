        "This grant proposal, titled \"Meeting Darwin's last challenge: toward a global tree of human languages and genes\", aims to address the weakness of available language classification methods by developing a new method based on grammatical evidence and advances in formal and typological linguistics. The proposed project will involve a collaborative approach where linguists and biologists work together to select significant populations for language and gene sampling. Utilizing the newest genetic tools and data types such as genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, markers of the Y chromosome, and markers of mitochondrial DNA, biostatistical methods will be employed to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity. By integrating these disciplines, the project seeks to achieve unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, allowing for the measurement of linguistic distances between remote populations. Ultimately, this research aims to fulfill Darwin's prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations, with potential implications for our understanding of human history and evolution.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the challenge of creating a global tree of human languages and genes, inspired by Darwin's prediction of isomorphism between language and population trees. Building on the contributions of molecular biology to species classification, the project aims to utilize a new method based on grammatical evidence and advances in linguistics for more reliable and testable language classification. By incorporating the latest genetic tools and biostatistical methods, the project will analyze genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome markers, and mitochondrial DNA to explore the relationships between linguistic and genetic diversity. The collaborative approach involves linguists and biologists jointly selecting populations for sampling, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation. The project's theoretical impact lies in advancing our understanding of human evolution and migration patterns, with potential implications for fields such as anthropology and evolutionary biology. This grant proposal represents a unique opportunity to address a longstanding challenge in the study of human languages and genes, with the potential to reshape our understanding of human history and diversity.",
        "The proposed project, \"Meeting Darwin's last challenge: toward a global tree of human languages and genes,\" seeks to address the weakness of available language classification methods by introducing a new method based on grammatical evidence and advances in formal and typological linguistics. This innovative approach, backed by the work of Longobardi and Guardiano (2009), offers unprecedented standards of testability and replicability, allowing for the measurement of linguistic distances between remote populations. By collaborating with linguists and biologists to select significant populations for language and gene sampling, this project aims to establish a robust framework for understanding the relationships between linguistic and genetic diversity. Leveraging the newest genetic tools and biostatistical methods, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and markers of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, this research will contribute to Darwin's prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. The theoretical impact of this work extends the rise of molecular biology's contribution to the historical classification of species and populations, building upon the groundwork laid by key advocates such as Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et al. (1988, 1994)."
