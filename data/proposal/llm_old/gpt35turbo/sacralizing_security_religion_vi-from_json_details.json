        "\"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" is a research project that aims to investigate the dynamics of religious vigilantes in mega-cities where state agencies lack capacity to provide infrastructure and security, leading to the emergence of non-state security actors. By focusing on cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, the project will employ an ethnographic comparison methodology to explore why residents grant religious vigilantes authority and how religion plays a role in legitimizing their practices. The project seeks to analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes, draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, and enable a nuanced analysis of the particularities of each religious tradition in the context of vigilantism. This research will contribute to extending the boundaries of the anthropology of religion and political anthropology, providing insights into power structures in mega-cities of the Global South, and informing policies aimed at improving human security. \"Sacralizing Security\" will shed light on the complexities of security, violence, and authority in urban settings, with implications for both academia and policy-making.",
        "\"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" is a research project that aims to investigate the role of religion in the legitimation of vigilante practices in mega-cities facing challenges such as lack of infrastructure and security provided by state agencies. The project will focus on religious organizations, non-state security actors, vigilantes, and state actors in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, with a methodology based on ethnographic comparison. By analyzing the production of authority of religious vigilantes and drawing general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance, the project seeks to extend the boundaries of anthropology of religion and political anthropology. The findings of this research will provide valuable insights into power structures in mega-cities of the Global South and contribute to policies aimed at improving human security. Through in-depth case studies and research questions focused on understanding why residents grant authority to religious vigilantes, \"Sacralizing Security\" aims to shed light on the complexities of security, violence, and authority in these urban environments.",
        "\"Sacralizing Security: Religion, Violence and Authority in Mega-Cities of the Global South\" seeks to address the pressing issues of infrastructure and security gaps in mega-cities of the Global South, exacerbated by the emergence of religious vigilantes. By examining the dynamics between state agencies, religious organizations, non-state security actors, and vigilantes, this project aims to understand why mega-city residents grant authority to religious vigilantes and how religion legitimizes their practices. Through ethnographic comparison in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Jakarta, the project will analyze the production of authority of religious vigilantes and draw general conclusions about the role of religion in alternative governance. The research will not only extend the boundaries of anthropology of religion and political anthropology but also provide valuable insights into power structures in mega-cities of the Global South. Ultimately, the findings will contribute to policies aimed at improving human security in these complex urban environments. \"Sacralizing Security\" is a crucial step towards understanding and addressing the intricate relationship between religion, violence, and authority in the Global South's mega-cities."
