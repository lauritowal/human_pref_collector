        "This grant proposal seeks to advance the understanding of intergroup toleration in culturally diverse societies. Titled \"Intergroup toleration: It’s Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies,\" the project aims to delve into the social psychology of tolerance and its implications. The significance of this research lies in its potential to address the crucial issue of fostering harmony within increasingly diverse communities.\n\nThe project will explore various components of intergroup toleration, including the underlying psychological aspects, processes, limits, and social psychological consequences. The methods employed will include survey data analysis, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG technology. The expected outcome of this research is to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration and contribute to the promotion of a more tolerant society.\n\nWhat sets this project apart is its novelty - systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration is currently limited, making this research both groundbreaking and timely. By shedding light on the nature of tolerance in diverse societies, this project has the potential to inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting social cohesion and inclusivity.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to advance the understanding of intergroup toleration in culturally diverse societies. Titled \"Intergroup toleration: It’s Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies\", the project aims to contribute to the social sciences by focusing on the social psychology of tolerance. The significance of this research lies in addressing the crucial question of how to live harmoniously in societies that are becoming increasingly diverse.\n\nThe project will consist of several components, including investigating the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance, exploring the processes that drive tolerance, examining the limits of tolerance, and analyzing the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. The proposed methods for this research include utilizing survey data, conducting framing experiments, and performing lab experiments involving EEG.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to the development of a more tolerant society. The novelty of this research lies in its systematic empirical approach to studying intergroup toleration, filling a gap in the existing literature and offering groundbreaking and timely contributions to the field.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to advance the understanding of intergroup toleration in culturally diverse societies through systematic empirical research. Titled \"Intergroup toleration: It’s Nature, Processes, and Consequences for Culturally Diverse Societies,\" the project aims to shed light on the underlying psychological aspects, processes, limits, and social psychological consequences of tolerance. By utilizing survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG, this research will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, ultimately contributing to a more tolerant society.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in addressing the pressing question of how individuals can live harmoniously in increasingly diverse societies. The novelty of this research is highlighted by the scarcity of systematic empirical studies on intergroup toleration, making this project ground-breaking and timely. By focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration, this research will not only advance the state of the art in social sciences but also offer practical implications for promoting a more inclusive and tolerant society. Ultimately, this grant proposal seeks to enhance our understanding of intergroup dynamics and pave the way for a more cohesive and harmonious future for culturally diverse societies."
