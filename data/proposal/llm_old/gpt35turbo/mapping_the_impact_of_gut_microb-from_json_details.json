        "The proposed project, \"Mapping the impact of gut microbiota on brain and behaviour through the lens of GABA,\" aims to address the knowledge gap surrounding the influence of gut-produced neurotransmitters, specifically GABA, on human brain function and behavior. Leveraging a biochemically informed approach, the project will explore the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Additionally, the project will investigate the effects of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain function and behavior over a four-week period through the administration of a custom-made probiotic intervention.\n\nWith a focus on GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter known to play a crucial role in regulating neural excitability, the project will shed light on the intricate relationship between gut microbiota, GABA levels in the brain, and human behavior. By utilizing both direct and proxy measures in the assay methods, the project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how gut bacteria and probiotics impact brain GABA levels and function.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research effort brings together experts in psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to explore new frontiers in understanding individual differences in human behavior and brain function. By uncovering the intricate interplay between gut microbiota and brain neurotransmitters, the project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the gut-brain axis and pave the way for innovative interventions targeting brain health and behavior.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on brain and behavior, specifically focusing on the role of the neurotransmitter GABA. The project aims to address a knowledge gap regarding the influence of gut-produced neurotransmitters on brain function and behavior. By examining the genetic identicality of humans and the distinctness of gut bacteria, the proposal aims to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and brain GABA levels.\n\nThe project will utilize a biochemically informed approach and employ assay methods such as direct measurements and proxy measures to investigate the modulation of brain GABA levels and task performance by gut bacteria. Additionally, the proposal will test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain function and behavior through a four-week intervention using a custom-made probiotic.\n\nThrough collaboration across disciplines including psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology, this research aims to shed light on individual differences in human behavior and brain function. The ultimate research goal is to understand how gut bacteria and probiotics influence brain GABA levels and function, with the potential to uncover new insights into the gut-brain axis and its impact on mental health and well-being.",
        "The proposed project, \"Mapping the impact of gut microbiota on brain and behaviour through the lens of GABA,\" aims to address a critical knowledge gap by investigating the influence of gut-produced neurotransmitters, specifically GABA, on human brain function and behavior. This project leverages the high genetic identicality between humans and the significant impact of even small genetic differences on biological processes. With a focus on GABA, the project will explore the modulation of brain GABA levels and GABA-ergic task performance by gut bacteria in human adults using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Additionally, the project will test the impact of ingested GABA-producing bacteria on brain and behavior through a four-week intervention with a custom-made probiotic.\n\nBy employing biochemically informed approaches and utilizing direct and proxy assay methods, this interdisciplinary project brings together expertise from psychology, neuroscience, and gut microbiology to advance our understanding of the complex relationship between gut microbiota, probiotics, and brain GABA levels and function. The research frontier of individual differences in human behavior and brain function will be explored through this innovative research endeavor. Ultimately, the project's goal is to shed light on the potential therapeutic implications of manipulating the gut microbiota to modulate brain GABA levels and function, offering new insights into the gut-brain connection and paving the way for novel interventions to improve mental health and well-being."
