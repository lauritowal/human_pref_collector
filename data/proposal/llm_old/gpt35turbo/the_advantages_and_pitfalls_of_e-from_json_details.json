        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the advantages and pitfalls of elicited online user engagement, focusing on the impact of calls to action on websites from both business and societal perspectives. The project will utilize an empirical approach, including lab and field experiments, to achieve the following objectives: understanding user engagement and its elicitation, determining the direct value of user engagement for businesses, assessing societal implications, characterizing effects in various product domains, and isolating underlying mechanisms of calls to action.\n\nPreliminary results suggest that calls to action have significant effects on both conversion rates and information revelation. The project will collaborate with a leading website-development service provider with a freemium business model to ensure the relevance and applicability of the research findings. \n\nThe anticipated impact of this project includes enhancing economic and societal understanding of social computing, providing valuable insights for businesses and policymakers. By shedding light on the dynamics of online user engagement, this research has the potential to inform strategies for website optimization, marketing campaigns, and user interaction design in the digital age.",
