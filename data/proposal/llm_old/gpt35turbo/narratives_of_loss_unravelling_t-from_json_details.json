        "The grant proposal \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas\" aims to investigate the relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative political agendas. With a focus on Europe, where there is a growing prejudice towards marginalized groups and an increase in support for far-right parties, this project seeks to address the lack of understanding regarding why financial crises coincide with such political shifts. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics, the study hypothesizes that economic hardship leads to narratives of loss which, in turn, trigger support for socially conservative agendas. Through a multi-method empirical approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research, the project will compare five European countries with varying levels of economic hardship compensation to uncover the contextual factors influencing this relationship. Ultimately, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of support for socially conservative political agendas in times of economic distress.",
        "The \"Narratives of Loss\" grant proposal aims to investigate the origins of support for socially conservative political agendas in the context of economic hardship. The project seeks to unravel how economic challenges impact individuals' backing for such ideologies and how local and national policy contexts influence this relationship. With a focus on the growing prejudice towards marginalized groups in Europe and the rise in support for far-right parties, this study addresses the lack of understanding regarding the correlation between financial crises and increased far-right party support. Drawing on political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioral economics, the project hypothesizes that economic hardship leads to narratives of loss, which in turn spur support for socially conservative political agendas. Through a multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research, the study will compare five European countries with varying levels of economic hardship compensation to shed light on the impact of context on these narratives and political preferences.",
        "The proposed project, \"Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,\" aims to investigate the impact of economic hardship on support for socially conservative political agendas in Europe. With a focus on understanding the influence of policy contexts at local and national levels, the study seeks to address the knowledge gap surrounding the correlation between financial crises and increased support for far-right parties. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from political science, sociology, social psychology, and behavioural economics, the project will employ a multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research. By comparing five European countries with varying levels of economic hardship compensation, including France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the study will shed light on the role of context in shaping narratives of loss and their connection to support for socially conservative political agendas. This research has the potential to inform policy interventions aimed at addressing growing prejudice and threats to community cohesion in Europe."
