        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the values of French language and literature in the European Middle Ages, focusing on the period between 1100-1450. The project aims to revaluate the use of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe during this time, with a specific emphasis on its role in shaping linguistic identity on the continent. The research questions will explore the relationship between language and identity historically, as well as demarcate cognate languages from each other.\n\nUtilizing approaches such as codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, the project will involve collaboration between scholars from European countries and North America. By conducting empirical research on the textual tradition of 'L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César' and engaging in speculative reflection on linguistic identity, the project aims to shed light on the significance of the French language in the emergence of a European identity during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural and linguistic landscape of medieval Europe, highlighting the importance of French as a language of communication and expression during this period. Through this interdisciplinary and collaborative effort, the project seeks to advance scholarly knowledge and promote cross-cultural dialogue on the values of French language and literature in shaping European identity in the Middle Ages.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"The values of French language and literature in the European Middle Ages,\" aims to reevaluate the significance of French as a supralocal, transnational language in Europe from 1100 to 1450. The project will focus on exploring the linguistic identity in Europe during this period, specifically examining the relationship between language and identity historically and demarcating cognate languages from each other. \n\nDrawing on the historical context of the Middle Ages, characterized by multilingualism and the presence of non-local languages such as Latin and French, the project seeks to foster collaboration between different scholarly traditions. Through empirical research on the textual tradition of 'L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César' and speculative reflection on linguistic identity, the project aims to shed light on the role of the French language in the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages.\n\nUtilizing approaches such as codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology, the project will involve scholars from European countries and North America. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, the project ultimately aims to deepen our understanding of the values of French language and literature in shaping European identity during the Middle Ages.",
