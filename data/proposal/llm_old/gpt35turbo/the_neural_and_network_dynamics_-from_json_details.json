        "The proposed project, titled \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence,\" aims to investigate the impact of social influence on adolescent development, academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. The project will focus on exploring the role of social media and viral risk-taking challenges as amplification factors in shaping adolescent behavior.\n\nThe project's goals include developing a new theoretical framework and formalizing novel computational models to better understand how adolescents seek and process social information. Key novelties of the project include viewing adolescents as active information seekers, using computational models with functional magnetic imaging, conducting experimental studies in real peer social networks, and applying social network analyses.\n\nThe research questions to be addressed include determining when adolescents search for social information and who they learn from. The methods to be employed in this study include the development of novel tasks, computational models, functional magnetic imaging, and social network analyses.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include providing insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, advancing understanding of social learning mechanisms, and informing the development of interventions to support healthy adolescent development. Ultimately, this research has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of how social influence shapes adolescent behavior and decision-making processes.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence\" aims to investigate the impact of social influence on adolescent development, academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking. The project will explore how social media and viral risk-taking challenges amplify these factors. The goals include developing a new theoretical framework and formalizing novel computational models to understand adolescents as active information seekers.\n\nNovel aspects of the project include the development of novel tasks, the use of computational models with functional magnetic imaging, an experimental study in real peer social networks, and the application of social network analyses. Key research questions revolve around when adolescents search for social information and who they choose to learn from.\n\nThe proposed methods involve the development of novel tasks, computational models, functional magnetic imaging, and social network analyses. The expected outcomes include insights into the role of social information in adolescent behavior, an advancement in understanding social learning mechanisms, and informing the development of interventions to support adolescents.\n\nThis project has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of adolescent development and inform interventions to promote positive outcomes in this critical stage of life.",
        "The proposed project, \"The Neural and Network Dynamics of Social Influence Across Adolescence,\" aims to investigate the complex interplay between neural processes and social networks in shaping adolescent behavior. This research is crucial due to the significant impact of social influence on various aspects of adolescent development, such as academic achievement, prosocial behavior, and risk-taking.\n\nThrough a combination of novel theoretical frameworks, computational models, and experimental tasks, this project seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive adolescents to seek social information and determine whom they choose to learn from. By integrating functional magnetic imaging and social network analyses, the study will provide unprecedented insights into the neural and network dynamics of social influence during adolescence.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of how social information influences adolescent behavior, advancements in the understanding of social learning mechanisms, and the potential to inform the development of targeted interventions aimed at promoting positive social interactions among adolescents. By conducting experimental studies within real peer social networks and utilizing cutting-edge methodologies, this project has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of adolescent social influence dynamics and contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions."
