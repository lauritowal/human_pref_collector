        "The \"Truth and Semantics\" grant proposal aims to provide a unified perspective on natural language semantics, focusing on truth-conditional semantics and theories of self-applicable truth related to semantic paradoxes. The project will address key challenges such as the role of truth in semantics and the foundations of semantics. \n\nSpecific objectives include developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, encompassing the notion of truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. Additionally, the project will explore the metasemantic perspective on the role of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, shedding light on the intricate relationship between truth and semantics. By delving into these complex issues, the project aims to contribute significantly to the field of linguistics and philosophy, offering new insights and approaches to understanding the nature of truth in natural language. This grant proposal seeks funding to support research activities, data collection, and dissemination of findings to the academic community and beyond.",

Additionally, the project will investigate the metasemantic perspective on the role of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this project is the first comprehensive study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective. By bridging the gap between truth-conditional semantics and theories of self-applicable truth, this research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between truth and semantics.\n\nOverall, the \"Truth and Semantics\" project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of natural language semantics and provide a solid foundation for future research in this area.",
        "The \"Truth and Semantics\" grant proposal seeks to provide a unified perspective on natural language semantics, specifically focusing on truth-conditional semantics and theories of self-applicable truth in relation to semantic paradoxes. The project aims to address the challenges surrounding truth in semantics and the foundations of semantics by developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language that include modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. Additionally, the project will explore the metasemantic perspective on the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThe primary objectives of the proposal are to advance the understanding of truth in semantics through the development of comprehensive semantic accounts for various aspects of natural language. By approaching the study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, the project will contribute to the first systematic study in this field. The anticipated outcome of the project is to provide new insights and frameworks for understanding truth in natural language semantics, ultimately advancing the broader field of linguistics and philosophical inquiry. This grant proposal represents a unique opportunity to further explore the complex relationship between truth and semantics, with the potential to significantly impact the academic community and beyond."
