        "The grant proposal, titled \"Florilegia Syriaca: The Intercultural Dissemination of Greek Christian Thought in Syriac and Arabic in the First Millennium CE\", aims to explore the metamorphoses of Greek Christian thought in Syriac and Arabic during the first millennium CE. Focusing on the cultural mediation of Syriac Christianity, the project seeks to address the current knowledge gap surrounding this topic, which is little-known today.\n\nThrough objectives such as illuminating Syriac and Christian Arabic sources, defining the religious identity of Syriac Christians, creating open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia, and studying the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors, the project aims to shed light on the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity. By producing anthologies of florilegia and examining neglected writings from the 8th to 11th centuries, the research will contribute to a better understanding of the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge between the intellectual histories of Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its innovative approach to studying Syriac florilegia and the patristic canon period, which are shared by European and Middle Eastern Christian cultures. By exploring these groundbreaking endeavors, the project will not only impact Europe's current religious discourses but also contribute to the preservation of the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians. Ultimately, this research will have far-reaching implications for the fields of intellectual history, religious studies, and cultural heritage preservation.",

Focusing on the cultural mediation of Syriac Christianity, which is little-known today, this project seeks to define the religious identity of Syriac Christians by illuminating Syriac and Christian Arabic sources. The key objectives include creating open-access digital editions of Syriac florilegia and studying the writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors.\n\nThrough the production of florilegia (anthologies), this project will explore groundbreaking endeavors such as producing digital editions of Syriac florilegia from the 8th-10th centuries and studying neglected writings of Syriac and Christian Arabic authors from the 8th-11th centuries. The research outcomes are expected to contribute to an improved understanding of the cultural dynamics of Late Antiquity and the role of patristic Christianity as a bridge between the intellectual histories of Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, the study aims to have a broader impact on comprehending Europe's current religious discourses and preserving the endangered cultural heritage of Syriac Christians. By delving into this unexplored territory, the project seeks to enrich our knowledge of the intercultural dissemination of Greek Christian thought in the early centuries of the Common Era.",
