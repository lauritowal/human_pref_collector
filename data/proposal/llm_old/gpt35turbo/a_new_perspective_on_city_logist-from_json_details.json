        "The proposed project, \"A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service,\" aims to revolutionize city logistics planning and management by developing a innovative measurement system based on public value. This system will incorporate multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of logistics operations in urban areas. \n\nThe project has three main objectives: \n1. Develop public value as a measurement system using various methods such as multi-criteria decision making and sustainability analysis.\n2. Design principles, models, and tools for Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure using network optimization.\n3. Develop a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures by introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the creation of a new theory of city logistics, efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and the maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research are vast, with scientific and practical implications for the transport and logistics industry, as well as social, economic, and environmental consequences. This project has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and sustainability of city logistics, making it a valuable investment for the future of urban transportation.",
        "The proposed project, \"A New Perspective on City Logistics: Concepts, Theory, and Models for Designing and Managing Logistics as a Service,\" aims to revolutionize city logistics planning and management by developing a comprehensive measurement system based on public value. This system will incorporate multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of logistics operations in urban areas.\n\nThe project's objectives include developing principles, models, and tools for Logistics as a Service (LaaS) infrastructure design through network optimization, as well as creating a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures by introducing logistics markets and learning-based optimization.\n\nExpected outcomes of this project include the development of a new theory of city logistics, efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and the maximization of public value in city logistics. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential scientific and practical implications for the field of transport and logistics, as well as significant social, economic, and environmental consequences for urban areas.\n\nBy bridging the gap between theory and practice in city logistics, this project has the potential to reshape the way logistics services are designed and managed in urban environments, ultimately leading to more sustainable, efficient, and valuable logistics operations.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to develop a new perspective on city logistics by focusing on the concepts, theory, and models for designing and managing Logistics as a Service (LaaS). The project will introduce a novel measurement system based on public value, incorporating multi-criteria decision making, sustainability analysis, simulation, and optimization techniques. The objectives of the proposal include developing principles, models, and tools for LaaS infrastructure design, as well as creating a theoretical framework and models for LaaS operating procedures. The expected outcomes of this research project include the development of a new theory of city logistics, efficiency gains in LaaS infrastructure, and the maximization of public value in city logistics.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, with both scientific and practical implications for the field of transport and logistics. Additionally, there are social, economic, and environmental consequences that could result from the implementation of the proposed models and tools. By focusing on public value as a key measurement system and incorporating advanced optimization techniques, this project has the potential to revolutionize city logistics planning and management."
