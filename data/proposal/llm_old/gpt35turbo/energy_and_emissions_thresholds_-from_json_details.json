        "The proposed project, \"Energy and emissions thresholds for providing decent living standards to all,\" aims to address key research questions surrounding the quantification of energy needs and climate change impacts for achieving decent living standards globally. This project will focus on operationalizing basic needs views of human development to discern the characteristics of basic goods in household consumption patterns. It will also quantify energy needs and climate-related emissions for decent living constituents in five emerging economies, taking into account cultural, climatic, technological, and other contextual factors.\n\nThrough a combination of lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modeling, this project seeks to develop knowledge on the energy needs for decent living standards, analyze the climate change impacts of energy use, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and help quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. By analyzing path dependencies and trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity, this project will contribute valuable insights into the intersection of energy, emissions, and decent living standards. Ultimately, this research aims to inform policy decisions and strategies for achieving sustainable development goals while mitigating climate change.",
        "The proposed project, \"Energy and emissions thresholds for providing decent living standards to all,\" aims to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts associated with achieving decent living standards globally. By operationalizing basic needs views of human development and analyzing the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity, this research seeks to answer vital questions such as what constitutes 'decent living standards' and how energy resources can be allocated to meet these standards while minimizing climate change impacts. \n\nUsing methodologies such as lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modeling, the project will focus on five emerging economies to understand the dependence of energy needs on cultural, climatic, technological, and other contextual factors. The objectives of this study include developing knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyzing climate change impacts of energy use, identifying low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and aiding in quantifying burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation efforts.\n\nBy shedding light on the energy requirements for achieving decent living standards and the associated climate change implications, this project aims to inform policy decisions and aid in the development of sustainable pathways for global development.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Energy and emissions thresholds for providing decent living standards to all,\" aims to quantify the energy needs and climate change impacts associated with achieving decent living standards worldwide. The research will focus on key questions such as defining what constitutes \"decent living standards,\" identifying the energy resources required to meet these standards in different countries, and understanding how these needs evolve as countries develop. \n\nThe project will involve operationalizing basic needs views of human development, quantifying energy needs and emissions for decent living constituents in five emerging economies, and analyzing trends in the evolution of basic goods and their energy intensity. By utilizing methods such as lifecycle analysis, input-output analysis, and integrated assessment modeling, the project seeks to develop knowledge on energy needs for decent living standards, analyze climate change impacts, identify low-carbon pathways for developing societies, and quantify burden-sharing arrangements for climate mitigation. \n\nOverall, this research will contribute valuable insights into the relationship between energy consumption, emissions, and achieving decent living standards, with the ultimate goal of informing policies and strategies to promote sustainable development and mitigate climate change."
