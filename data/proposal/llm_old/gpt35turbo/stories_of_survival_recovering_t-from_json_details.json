        "The grant proposal \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\" seeks to shed light on the global migration patterns of Eastern Christians from the sixteenth century onwards. With a transnational focus, the project aims to explore the historical journeys of Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. The research team, composed of multiple researchers under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, will utilize a global and connected historical framework to uncover the intertwined narratives of Eastern Christianity.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of sources including archives from three continents in ten languages, the project will tackle the conceptual challenge of linking individual everyday experiences to broader global narratives. Methodologically, the project will employ philology and source criticism to analyze and interpret the diverse source materials. The anticipated outcomes of the project include print publications, workshops, and the development of a searchable database. By focusing on the time period from 1500 to 1750 and centering on the experiences of Eastern Christians, this project aims to contribute to the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history by reconstructing and recovering the interconnected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world.",
        "The \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World\" grant proposal aims to illuminate the transnational and interconnected histories of Eastern Christians from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. By examining the global migration patterns of Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas, this project seeks to uncover the untold stories of survival and resilience in the face of historical challenges.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary research team utilizing a global and connected historical framework, this project will explore the rich source materials from three continents, spanning over ten languages and dozens of archives. The conceptual challenge of linking micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives in global history will be addressed through methodological cores in philology and source criticism.\n\nThe project outcomes will include printed publications, workshops, and a searchable database, providing valuable insights into the often-overlooked histories of Eastern Christians. By covering fields such as Middle Eastern, European, and global history, this project will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of religious migration and survival in the early modern world.\n\nOverall, this grant proposal seeks to shed light on the resilience and endurance of Eastern Christians in the face of historical upheavals, offering a new perspective on the interconnected histories of this often marginalized community.",
        "The proposed project, \"Stories of Survival: Recovering the Connected Histories of Eastern Christianity in the Early Modern World,\" aims to explore the transnational and interconnected histories of Eastern Christians from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. This project will involve multiple researchers working under the supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI) to uncover the migration patterns of Christians from the Ottoman Empire to Europe, India, Russia, and the Americas. By utilizing a global and connected analytical frame, the research team will delve into source materials from three continents, in ten languages, and from dozens of archives.\n\nThe project's conceptual challenge lies in linking the micro-scale everyday life of Eastern Christians to the macro-narratives of global history. Methodologically, the team will employ philology and source criticism to uncover and interpret historical documents. The outcomes of the project will include print publications, workshops, and the creation of a searchable database for future research.\n\nThis project fills a gap in existing scholarship by focusing on a neglected aspect of global history, shedding light on the experiences of Eastern Christians during a crucial period of migration and cultural exchange. By uncovering these stories of survival, the project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world."
