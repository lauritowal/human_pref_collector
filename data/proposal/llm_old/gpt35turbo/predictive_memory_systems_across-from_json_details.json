        "The proposed project, titled \"Predictive Memory Systems Across the Human Lifespan,\" aims to advance our understanding of neurocognitive architectures by examining the role of predictive processing in memory. The research framework is based on predictive coding, focusing on concepts such as the prediction machine, internal models, and future state predictions. Key empirical questions include investigating the nature and influence of internal models on predictions, as well as exploring the variability of prediction processes due to brain diversity from maturation and senescence.\n\nThe study population will include children, younger adults, and older adults, with a focus on investigating episodic and semantic memory. The research methods will involve the integration of predictive coding, memory systems, and lifespan development research, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in experimental designs. The project will also explore developmental orientations such as progression and conservation, as well as neurocognitive factors like the structural and functional integrity of memory neural circuits.\n\nThe potential impact of this research includes establishing a dynamic version of the predictive brain principle and gaining insights into the emergence of disorders in different life stages. Overall, this project, named PIVOTAL, seeks to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying predictive processing in memory across the human lifespan.",
