        "This grant proposal seeks to explore the concept of network epistemology in the context of particle physics research at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). The project will focus on understanding knowledge generation and validation in large scientific collaborations, characterizing collective research processes through analysis of internal communication, and reconstructing this communication from born-digital documents. By delving into the internal communication channels such as e-mails and internal wiki pages, the study aims to develop historiographic guidelines for future research and contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation.\n\nUsing digital humanities tools and computational methods, this project will offer methodological innovations in capturing and analyzing large-scale research processes for epistemological purposes. The outcomes of this research will include historiographic guidelines for studies based on born-digital sources and practical strategies for best practices in the history and philosophy of science. By adapting theoretical models of network epistemology to real-world scientific collaborations, this project will offer valuable insights into the dynamics of knowledge creation within interdisciplinary research environments. Ultimately, this research will shed light on the intricate processes of knowledge production and validation in scientific communities, providing a foundation for future studies in the history and philosophy of science.",
        "The proposed project, \"Network epistemology in practice,\" aims to explore knowledge generation and validation within large scientific collaborations, focusing on particle physics at CERN.
