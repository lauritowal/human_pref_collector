        "The grant proposal \"Between Canon and Coincidence: using data-driven approaches to understand Art Worlds\" (BECACO) seeks to reconceptualize the provenance of ethnographic and archaeological collections through the study of socio-politico-historical conjunctures that lead to the translocation of cultural material. Building on the original concept of \"Art World Patterns\" introduced by Becker in 2008[1982], this project will employ quantitative analyses, network analysis, and data mining on a large corpus of provenance data from 12 museums across 9 countries in Europe. Focused on Indigenous Latin American material from the time frame of 1850 to 2000, the research aims to develop new models for provenance research, as well as conceptual and methodological advances. By examining the representation and perception of Indigenous Latin America in Europe, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of art worlds and their impact on cultural heritage. Ultimately, this project has the potential to reshape the way we approach the provenance of cultural artifacts and enhance our knowledge of cross-cultural interactions in the art world.",

By exploring the intersections between art, culture, and history, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how art worlds are shaped and perceived. The outcomes of this study have the potential to inform future research in provenance studies and enhance our understanding of cultural exchange and representation."
