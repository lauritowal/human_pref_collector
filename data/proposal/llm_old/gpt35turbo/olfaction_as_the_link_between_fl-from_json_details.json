        "The proposed project, \"Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption\" (OLFLINK), aims to revolutionize human diets for improved global health and sustainability by addressing the challenge of overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors. The project will focus on odor-taste associative learning, specifically investigating the cortical processes involved in the transfer of appetitive properties from odors. Key questions to be explored include the acquisition of new flavor preferences and the regulation of these preferences by signals from the digestive tract.\n\nOLFLINK will consist of three investigation levels: CODE, CONTROL, and REGULATE. These levels will respectively focus on determining the code by which odors acquire and evoke taste associations, delineating the cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of odor-taste associations, and investigating interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval.\n\nThe project's potential impact includes the adjustment of learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, understanding the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and developing novel interventions for dietary changes over the life course. Through a comprehensive exploration of olfactory perception both inside and outside the mouth, OLFLINK will provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie flavor preference formation and retrieval, ultimately leading to transformative advancements in human diets and health.",
        "The proposed project, \"Olfaction as the link between flavor preference formation and retrieval during food consumption,\" aims to address the challenge of overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors in order to change human diets for global health and sustainability. The project, named OLFLINK, will focus on odour-taste associative learning and investigate the cortical processes involved in the transfer of appetitive properties from odour to taste. \n\nThe project will consist of three investigation levels: CODE, CONTROL, and REGULATE. The objectives include determining the distributed code for odour-taste associations, delineating cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of these associations, and understanding interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval.\n\nThe impact of this research includes the potential for adjusting learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, gaining insight into the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and developing novel interventions for dietary changes over the life course.\n\nOLFLINK will provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes that link olfactory perception inside and outside the mouth, offering valuable insights into how we form and retrieve flavor preferences. This project has the potential to revolutionize our approach to food consumption and dietary habits, ultimately contributing to better global health outcomes.",
        "The \"OLFLINK\" project aims to investigate the role of olfaction in shaping flavor preferences and retrieval during food consumption to address the challenge of overcoming preferences for familiar food flavors and ultimately change human diets for global health and sustainability. The project will focus on odor-taste associative learning and aims to fill the knowledge gap related to the cortical processes involved in the transfer of appetitive properties from odors. The project, conducted at three investigation levels, will seek to determine the distributed code for odor-taste associations, delineate cortical control mechanisms for encoding and retrieval of these associations, and explore interactions with digestive feedback that regulate the coding system during flavor preference acquisition and retrieval.\n\nThe outcomes of the project are expected to have a significant impact on adjusting learning and retrieval of food preferences based on nutritional needs, understanding the biological basis of maladaptive eating patterns, and developing novel interventions for dietary changes over the life course. By uncovering the processes that link olfactory perception both inside and outside the mouth, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into how we can better understand and influence food preferences to promote healthier eating habits on a global scale."
