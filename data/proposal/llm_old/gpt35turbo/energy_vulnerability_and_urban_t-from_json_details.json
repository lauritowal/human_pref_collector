        "The proposed project, titled \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe,\" seeks to address the challenges faced by millions of households in Eastern and Central Europe due to energy vulnerability. This vulnerability is caused by factors such as energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, and income differentials, which are exacerbated by decaying infrastructure and economic and political restructuring. The project aims to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty through a comparative study using qualitative and quantitative methods in case study locations including Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje.\n\nBy overcoming current conceptualization limitations related to incomes and energy efficiency, the project seeks to improve technical and institutional frameworks, provide affordable energy services, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Through this research, the project aims to transform the understanding of energy poverty in post-socialist city contexts. The outcomes of this project have the potential to inform policy and practice in addressing energy vulnerability and promoting sustainable urban transitions in Europe.",
        "The \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe\" grant proposal seeks to address the energy vulnerability affecting millions of households in Eastern and Central Europe. The project aims to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty by examining the causes such as energy price increases, cold climates, inefficient housing, and income differentials. The current conceptualization limitations related to incomes and energy efficiency will also be explored. \n\nUsing the framework of energy vulnerability, the project will take a comparative study approach utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Case study locations in cities like Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje will be examined to understand the unique challenges faced in post-socialist urban contexts. \n\nThe potential outcomes of the project include the improvement of technical and institutional frameworks, provision of affordable energy services, and contributions to climate change mitigation efforts. By shedding light on the complexities of energy poverty, this project aims to transform the understanding of the issue and provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in Europe.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"Energy Vulnerability and Urban Transitions in Europe,\" seeks to address the energy poverty affecting millions of households in Eastern and Central Europe. This project aims to investigate the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty by examining the causes such as energy price increases, inefficient housing, and income differentials. The current conceptualization limitations of energy poverty, focusing on incomes and energy efficiency, will be reevaluated through a comparative study using qualitative and quantitative methods in case study locations including Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. The potential outcomes of the project include the improvement of technical and institutional frameworks, provision of affordable energy services, and climate change mitigation. By exploring the complexities of energy vulnerability in post-socialist city contexts, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the challenges faced by households in these regions and pave the way for more effective interventions to alleviate energy poverty."
