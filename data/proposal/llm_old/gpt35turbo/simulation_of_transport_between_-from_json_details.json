        "The \"Simulation of Transport between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube\" grant proposal, known as STRADA, seeks to develop a dynamic computer-based simulation system that will investigate the transportation networks between the Adriatic Sea and the Danube during Roman times. The project aims to achieve several objectives, including the reconstruction of ancient land and water routes, studying spatial and temporal interconnectivity between Roman Italy and the Danube frontier, analyzing the influence of environmental factors on the ancient transport system, and integrating dynamic simulations into historical research.\n\nKey features of the simulation system include local fine granular topography, historical weather data, different means of transport with varying loads, fatigue of actors, and necessary rests and loading times. The research will focus on Mediterranean lowlands, Alpine regions, and Central European river landscapes. The project will follow a modular design approach for sustainable use and future extension.\n\nOverall, STRADA will combine technological advancements, experimental data, and historical research to simulate realistic transport times and gain insights into the economic cohesion of the Roman Empire. This innovative approach will provide valuable information on ancient transportation networks and their impact on the Roman economy.",
