        "The proposed project, \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" aims to study the memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in Spain, UK, France, and Germany from 2004 to 2019. With more than ten terrorist attacks resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries, the project will use approaches such as memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining after attacks. The objectives include developing a new materialist approach to terrorism, assessing policies and security infrastructures, and using performance art for alternative forms of remembering and future visions. The outputs of the project will include a website with interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and public performances by the 'Center for Political Beauty'. \"Urban Terrorism in Europe\" will provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism, filling a crucial gap in the understanding of how societies remember and respond to such traumatic events.",

        "The proposed project, \"Urban Terrorism in Europe (2004-2019): Remembering, Imagining, and Anticipating Violence,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. With over ten terrorist attacks resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the specified timeframe, this project seeks to analyze collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining after such incidents. By utilizing memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, the project will develop a new materialist approach to terrorism.\n\nThe project's objectives include assessing policies and security infrastructures, as well as using performance art for alternative forms of remembering and envisioning future scenarios. The anticipated outputs of this research include a website featuring interviews, two academic monographs, peer-reviewed journal articles, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and public performances by the 'Center for Political Beauty'. \"Urban Terrorism in Europe\" will provide the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in the selected European countries. This project will contribute valuable insights to the field of terrorism studies and memory discourse, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the complexities surrounding urban terrorism and its societal impacts."
