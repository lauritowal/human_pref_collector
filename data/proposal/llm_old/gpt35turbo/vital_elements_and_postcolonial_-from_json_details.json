        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Vital Elements and Postcolonial Moves: Forensics as the Art of Paying Attention in a Mediterranean Harbour Town\" based in Zarzis, Tunisia. The project aims to deepen our understanding of the end of lives in the Mediterranean context through the innovative use of forensics as the art of paying attention. The proposed case studies include phosphate extraction, sea sponge fishing, tomato cultivation, water extraction, and industrial waste abandonment, with a focus on mapping unliveable life conditions.\n\nKey characteristics of the project include a decolonial shift in attention from Europe to Africa, the development of forensics as a method for ethnographic study, and the advancement of the vital elements concept. Collaborations will involve team site visits, Method Lab work, and partnerships with local artists in the Vital Elements Atelier. By examining crucial resources for life and their interrelations in Zarzis, this program seeks to shed light on the complex dynamics shaping the lives of individuals in this Mediterranean harbour town. This project represents a unique opportunity to contribute to the field of postcolonial studies and advance our understanding of the social and environmental challenges facing communities in the region.",
