        "The project \"Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms\" (MERLIT) seeks to address the lack of comprehensive investigations into the formal principles of meritocratic narratives in literature. By exploring the practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques, the project aims to offer a literary history of meritocratic thought from the 17th century to the present. \n\nOne of the key objectives of MERLIT is to expand the contextual focus beyond Western contexts to include the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. By engaging with historical forms of meritocracy, the project seeks to advance our understanding of hegemonic forms in writing and highlight literature's worldmaking role. \n\nUtilizing a systematic, diachronic, and comparative approach, MERLIT will involve six work packages and draw on interdisciplinary fields such as literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation. Despite the criticisms of enmeshment with structures of domination and privilege, the project will provide a nuanced analysis of meritocratic narratives in literature with global relevance.\n\nOverall, MERLIT represents a groundbreaking initiative that will contribute significantly to the field by bridging research gaps and offering new insights into the complex relationship between meritocracy and literature.",
        "The proposed project, \"Meritocracy and Literature: Transcultural Approaches to Hegemonic Forms\" (MERLIT), aims to fill crucial research gaps in the study of meritocratic narratives in literature. By employing systematic, diachronic, and comparative methodologies, this project will explore the practices of writing that shape meritocratic articulations and critiques. It seeks to expand the contextual focus beyond Western contexts to include the Global South and transcultural anglophone contexts. \n\nThis interdisciplinary project will engage with historical forms of meritocracy from the 17th century to the present, drawing on fields such as literary history, new formalist theory, and cultural translation. Through six work packages, MERLIT will offer a comprehensive literary history of meritocratic thought, advancing understanding of hegemonic forms in writing. By highlighting literature's worldmaking role, this project will contribute to a deeper appreciation of the complexities and nuances of meritocracy in literary texts.\n\nDespite criticisms of enmeshment with structures of domination and privilege, MERLIT will provide a fresh perspective on meritocratic narratives, shedding light on previously unexplored formal principles and historical developments. With its global relevance and innovative approach, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to the fields of literary studies and cultural theory.",
