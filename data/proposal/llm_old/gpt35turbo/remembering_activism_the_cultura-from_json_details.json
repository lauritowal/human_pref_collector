        "The proposed project, \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe,\" seeks to provide a comprehensive examination of the remembering and forgetting of activism in Europe since the late 19th century. Through a multi-faceted approach, the project aims to reveal continuities and changes in protest depiction across different media regimes, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying memory of protest, and show how memory of protest influences later movements.\n\nThe project will focus on three distinct study periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, 2011-2012) and employ innovative methods such as network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references. By exploring mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes, the project will contribute to a major reorientation in cultural memory research, develop analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, open up new areas of social movement research, and provide critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity.\n\nOverall, this project will fill a significant gap in the understanding of activism in Europe and offer valuable insights into the cultural memory of protest. The findings will have implications for a wide range of disciplines and contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between memory, identity, and social movements.",
        "The proposed project, \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe,\" aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the remembering and forgetting of activism in Europe since the late 19th century. The project seeks to reveal continuities and changes in protest depiction across different media regimes, demonstrate the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying memory of protest, and show how memory of protest feeds back into later movements. The study will focus on three distinct periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, 2011-2012) and employ innovative methods such as network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references.\n\nThe implications of this project are significant, as it promises to bring about a major reorientation in cultural memory research, develop analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, open up a new area of social movement research, and provide critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity. By shedding light on the ways in which activism is remembered and forgotten in European societies, this project has the potential to deepen our understanding of the cultural dynamics that shape collective memory and identity. Ultimately, \"Remembering Activism\" seeks to contribute to a more nuanced and informed discussion on the role of protest in shaping European history and society.",
        "The proposed project, \"Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe,\" aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the ways in which activism has been remembered and forgotten in Europe since the late 19th century. By exploring the continuities and changes in protest depiction across different media regimes, the project seeks to uncover the role of texts, images, and commemorative practices in conveying the memory of protest. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate how memory of protest influences and shapes later movements.\n\nThrough a study of three distinct periods (1871-1914, 1960-1970, and 2011-2012), the project will investigate key themes such as mediation, afterlives, and memoryscapes. One of the key innovations of the project is the use of network visualization to map the reproduction of narratives and references in the cultural memory of protest.\n\nThe implications of this project are significant, including a major reorientation in cultural memory research, the development of analytic tools to capture the cultural transmission of hope, the opening up of new areas of social movement research, and the provision of critical literacies to rethink collective memory and identity. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the ways in which activism is remembered and forgotten in European societies, and its impact on shaping collective memory and identity."
