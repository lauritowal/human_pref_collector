        "The \"Modelling and maintaining maternal mental health\" grant proposal, also known as the HealthyMom project, aims to investigate the impact of unwanted terminated pregnancies on maternal mental health. The project's objectives include studying brain changes following pregnancy loss, understanding the reversal of motherhood-associated brain changes, identifying determinants of mental health post-pregnancy loss, and exploring the relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will acquire longitudinal data on women who have experienced early miscarriage or stillbirth, conduct brain imaging and hormonal assessments, monitor mental health comprehensively, and perform whole genome sequencing of women and their partners. The research will utilize multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry tools to reveal female-specific brain dynamics, neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability, and targets for maintaining maternal mental health.\n\nThe implications of this research extend to women's health and may have indirect benefits for the health of future offspring. By leveraging innovative research methods and advanced computational techniques, the HealthyMom project seeks to provide valuable insights into maternal mental health and contribute to the development of targeted interventions for women who have experienced pregnancy loss.",
        "The \"Modelling and maintaining maternal mental health\" grant proposal aims to investigate the impact of unwanted terminated pregnancy on female brain dynamics and mental health. The objectives of the project include studying traces of pregnancy loss in the brain, understanding the reversal of motherhood associated changes post-pregnancy loss, identifying determinants of mental health issues, and exploring the relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors. Through longitudinal data collection, brain imaging, hormonal assessments, mental health monitoring, and whole genome sequencing, the project will uncover neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability and potential targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The use of multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry tools will provide a comprehensive understanding of female-specific brain dynamics. The implications of this research extend to women's health and the health of future offspring. Overall, the HealthyMom project seeks to advance knowledge in the field of maternal mental health through innovative research methods and advanced computational techniques.",
        "The HealthyMom project aims to investigate the impact of early and late pregnancy loss on maternal mental health through a multidisciplinary approach. By studying the traces of unwanted terminated pregnancy in the female brain, understanding the reversal of motherhood-associated changes post-pregnancy loss, and identifying determinants of afflicted mental health, this project seeks to uncover the complex relationships between brain trajectories, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors. Through longitudinal data collection, brain imaging, hormonal assessments, mental health monitoring, and whole genome sequencing, the project will provide insights into female-specific brain dynamics and neurogenetic signatures of mental disorder vulnerability. The use of advanced tools such as multimodal brain imaging, statistical genetics, and computational psychiatry will enable the identification of targets for maintaining maternal mental health. The implications of this research extend beyond individual women's health to potentially impact the well-being of future offspring. By leveraging innovative research methods and computational techniques, the HealthyMom project aims to contribute to a better understanding of maternal mental health and inform strategies for supporting women who have experienced pregnancy loss."
