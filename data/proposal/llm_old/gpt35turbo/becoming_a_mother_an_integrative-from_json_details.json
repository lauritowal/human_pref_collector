        "The proposed project, \"Becoming a mother: An integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period,\" aims to develop an integrative model of adaptations for motherhood by studying nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, as well as nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy. The project will also include a control group of nulliparous women. \n\nThe objectives of the study include establishing when brain changes begin in pregnant women, characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, assessing the effect of environmental and psychological factors in maternal adaptations, identifying metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and integrating findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework.\n\nUsing a prospective longitudinal study design with five time points and a variety of data types (neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics), the project aims to deliver a longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, intermediate evaluations after the postpartum session, and cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session. This research has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Becoming a mother: An integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period,\" aims to develop an integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during these critical periods. The objectives include establishing the timeline of brain changes in pregnant women, characterizing cognitive performance and maternal-infant bonding dynamics, assessing the impact of environmental and psychological factors, identifying metabolomics biomarkers, and integrating findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework.\n\nThe study design is prospective longitudinal with five time points, including sessions pre-pregnancy, intra-pregnancy, and postpartum. Data will be collected through neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics measures. Participant groups include nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, those whose same-sex partners will undergo pregnancy, and control nulliparous women.\n\nThe deliverables will include a longitudinal RDoC-based model, intermediate evaluations after the postpartum session, and cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and postpartum session. This project has the potential to advance our understanding of maternal adaptations during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with implications for both maternal and infant health outcomes.",
        "The proposed project, \"Becoming a mother: An integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period\", aims to develop an integrative model of adaptations for motherhood during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The objectives of the study include establishing when brain changes begin in pregnant women and how they evolve, characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures, assessing the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors in maternal adaptations, identifying metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and integrating findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework.\n\nThe study design will be prospective longitudinal with five time points and sessions including one pre-pregnancy, two intra-pregnancy, and two postpartum sessions. Data collection will involve neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data. Participant groups will include nulliparous women undergoing full-term pregnancy, nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo full-term pregnancy, and control nulliparous women.\n\nThe deliverables of the project will include a longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, intermediate longitudinal evaluations after the postpartum session, and cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session.
