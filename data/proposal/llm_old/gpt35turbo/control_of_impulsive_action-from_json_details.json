        "The proposed project, \"Control of impulsive action,\" aims to advance our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and their potential for societal benefit. The research will address key questions such as the emergence of novel impulsive actions during task preparation, the influence of negative emotions on impulsive behavior, and the role of learning in modulating impulsivity. Utilizing a combination of behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques (TMS & EEG), physiological measures (facial EMG), and mathematical modeling of decision-making, the project seeks to achieve several objectives. These include specifying the origin and control of impulsive actions, replacing current inhibitory control models with multifaceted models, explaining impulsivity across time and space, developing a new behavioral model of impulsive action, understanding individual differences in impulsivity, and exploring disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. By addressing these objectives, the research aims to provide valuable insights into impulsive behavior and pave the way for interventions to improve impulse control in individuals, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.",

        "The proposed project, \"Control of impulsive action,\" aims to advance our understanding of impulse-control mechanisms and their potential improvement for individuals and society. The project seeks to address key research questions related to impulsive actions, including the emergence of novel impulsive actions, the impact of negative emotions, the role of learning, and the functional aspects of impulsive behaviors. The project will employ a variety of methods such as behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience techniques, physiological measures, and mathematical modeling to achieve its objectives.\n\nSpecific objectives include specifying the origin and control of impulsive actions, replacing current inhibitory control models with multifaceted models, explaining impulsivity across time and space, developing a new behavioral model of impulsive action, understanding individual differences in impulsivity, and exploring disorders associated with impulse-control deficits. By shedding light on these critical aspects of impulsive behavior, the project aims to not only contribute to scientific knowledge but also offer potential insights for interventions and treatments to improve impulse control in both clinical and non-clinical populations."
