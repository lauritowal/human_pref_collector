    "title": "Change in Policy Fields: The Impact of International and Domestic Factors on Morality Policies in 25 OECD Countries Between 1980 and 2010",
    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of international and domestic factors on morality policies in 25 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010. The objectives of this project are to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies and to develop explanations and identify patterns of changes in policy fields. The focus will be on examining changes in morality policy over time, comparing these changes across countries, and exploring variations across different policy subfields such as life and death, sexuality, and addictive substances and behavior. The proposed methodology includes a combination of macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies using legislative output data as the primary source of information. The selection of case studies will be based on results from the quantitative analysis, identifying critical cases for in-depth investigation. By shedding light on the influences shaping morality policies in diverse contexts, this research aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and practitioners working in the field of public policy and governance.",

The project aims to provide systematic empirical knowledge on the development of morality policies and to develop explanations for and identify patterns of changes in policy fields. The focus will be on examining changes in morality policy over time, comparing trends across countries, and analyzing variations across policy subfields such as life and death issues, sexuality, and addictive substances and behaviors.\n\nThe research will employ a combination of macro-quantitative analysis and qualitative case studies using legislative output data as the primary source. The selection of case studies will be based on results from the quantitative analysis, identifying critical cases for in-depth investigation. By shedding light on the influences shaping morality policies over a three-decade period, this project will contribute valuable insights to the fields of political science, public policy, and international relations. Ultimately, the findings from this study will offer important implications for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to understand and address moral policy changes in a global context.",
