        "The grant proposal \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine and Policing\" aims to explore the impact of algorithmic forecasting on various domains such as insurance, medicine, and policing. The project will focus on key areas such as Big Data, Machine Learning, digital forecasting, uncertainty management, probability calculus, and algorithmic prediction. By examining personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing, the research will address challenges such as the individualization of prediction, undermining the mutualization principle, and the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods. Additionally, the project will investigate issues related to bias, and the distinction between prevention and repression in algorithmic prediction.\n\nThis study will shed light on the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and its implications for social institutions. By understanding how these new prediction methods shape decision-making processes in insurance, medicine, and policing, the project will contribute valuable insights to the field of social sciences. Ultimately, the research will inform policymakers, practitioners, and the public about the potential risks and benefits of algorithmic forecasting, paving the way for more ethical and effective predictive practices in these critical domains.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine and Policing\" aims to explore the impact of algorithmic forecasting on social institutions such as insurance, medicine, and policing. The project will focus on domains including social sciences, insurance, medicine, and policing, with a particular emphasis on Big Data, Machine Learning, digital forecasting, uncertainty management, probability calculus, and algorithmic prediction. The research areas of personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing will be examined in depth.\n\nKey challenges to be addressed include the individualization of prediction, undermining the mutualization principle, combining algorithmic and statistical methods, addressing bias, and distinguishing between prevention and repression. The project will investigate the transition from probabilistic to algorithmic forms of prediction and how this shift impacts societal structures and norms.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute valuable insights into the ethical, social, and practical implications of algorithmic forecasting in various sectors. By addressing these challenges and exploring the consequences of algorithmic prediction, the research aims to inform policy-making and decision-making processes in insurance, medicine, and policing for a more equitable and just society.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"The Future of Prediction: The Social Consequences of Algorithmic Forecast in Insurance, Medicine and Policing\", aims to examine the social implications of the shift from probabilistic to algorithmic prediction in the domains of insurance, medicine, and policing. The project will focus on key areas such as Big Data, Machine Learning, digital forecasting, uncertainty management, probability calculus, and algorithmic prediction. \n\nThe research will specifically delve into personalized insurance, precision medicine, and predictive policing, exploring the challenges posed by the individualization of prediction, the erosion of the mutualization principle, the integration of algorithmic and statistical methods, the issue of bias, and the distinction between prevention and repression strategies.\n\nBy investigating the social consequences of algorithmic forecasting in these crucial domains, the project aims to shed light on the ethical, legal, and societal implications of this technological shift. The findings of this research will contribute to a better understanding of how algorithmic prediction impacts social institutions and guide the development of policies and practices that mitigate potential harms. Ultimately, this project seeks to inform decision-making processes and promote responsible and ethical use of predictive technologies in insurance, medicine, and policing.",
