    "descriptions": [
        "The grant proposal \"The Everyday Politics of Famine\" seeks to address the alarming rise in the frequency and severity of famines, with 250,000 individuals experiencing famine in 2022 and 35 million individuals teetering on the brink of starvation. The project aims to delve into the everyday politics of famine within communities, focusing on understanding the persistent nature of famines, shifts in the science of famine politics, the normalization of new deadly famines, and the displacement of blame for famine suffering.\n\nThrough an ethnographically-informed comparative study conducted in South Sudan and Somalia, the research will explore various research strands such as the histories and musical memories of past famines, community narratives that reinforce social networks, burial and posthumous practices, and the role of media and social media in anti-famine politics. The research team, predominantly composed of Somali and South Sudanese researchers, brings together a wealth of experience, networks, carefully built capacity, and a proven track record in similar research endeavors.\n\nBy shedding light on the intricate dynamics of the everyday politics of famine in these communities, this project aims to inform policy and advocacy efforts aimed at preventing and mitigating the impact of future famines. Ultimately, the research outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of the root causes of famine and pave the way for more effective interventions to combat this urgent global crisis.",
