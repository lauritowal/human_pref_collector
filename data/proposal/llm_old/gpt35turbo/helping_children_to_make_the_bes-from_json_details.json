        "The proposed project, \"Helping Children to Make the Best of their Transition to High School,\" aims to address key issues faced by students during the challenging transition to high school. The project will be led by the ERC-team with expertise in social-bio interplay. The project will target issues such as peer rejection, victimization, low support from teachers, and conflictual relations with teachers, focusing on areas of self-regulation and stress-regulation.\n\nThe intervention will involve the development of a serious game called A.L.I.B.I., set in a virtual high school environment where players uncover an alien disguised as a teacher or peer. The game will promote prosocial interactions, perspective-taking, and consideration of multiple response options, with a focus on long-term perspectives. The game will provide a realistic yet safe learning environment for students to rehearse prosocial behaviors.\n\nThe project goals include developing A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game, assessing its effectiveness, integrating it into ongoing school transition trainings, and developing a marketing strategy for implementation in The Netherlands and Europe. The project will collaborate with three school counseling organizations in three regions in The Netherlands to ensure successful implementation and impact. This innovative approach combines technology and psychology to support students during a critical period of their educational journey.",
