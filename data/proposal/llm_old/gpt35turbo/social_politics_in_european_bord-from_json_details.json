        "The grant proposal \"Social politics in European borderlands: A comparative and transnational study, 1870s-1990s\" seeks to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by focusing on the regions of Galicia, North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German border regions. The project will explore the contributions of local actors, the co-construction of welfare, and the interaction between public and private actors in the development of local welfare structures. Through a comparative analysis and transnational frameworks, the study aims to examine inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, understand competition in social provision, and trace the circulation of ideas, people, and practices.\n\nThe research will shed light on the historical study of local actors in welfare, inform contemporary debates on welfare reform, and address social rights issues in Europe. By delving into the intricate dynamics of social politics in European borderlands from the 1870s to the 1990s, this project will provide valuable insights into the complexities of welfare systems and their impact on local communities. Ultimately, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of social welfare in Europe and its implications for current social policy debates.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to conduct a comparative and transnational study titled \"Social Politics in European Borderlands: A Comparative and Transnational Study, 1870s-1990s\" to reframe the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe. The project will focus on three key border regions - Galicia, North-eastern Adriatic, and Franco/Belgian/German border regions - during the time period of 1870s-1990s. The study will explore key concepts such as local actors contributions, co-construction of welfare, public and private actors interaction, local welfare structures, and national and non-national identity/solidarity.\n\nUtilizing a research approach that includes comparative analysis and transnational frameworks, the project aims to examine inclusion and exclusion in welfare provision, understand the competition in social provision, and trace the circulation of ideas, people, and practices. This study is relevant for historical analysis of local actors in welfare, informing contemporary debates on welfare reform, and addressing social rights issues in Europe. By shedding light on the complexities of social politics in European borderlands, this project will contribute valuable insights to scholarship and policy-making in the field of welfare and social care.",
