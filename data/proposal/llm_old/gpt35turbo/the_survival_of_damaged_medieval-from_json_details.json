        "The grant proposal titled \"The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\" seeks to investigate the factors influencing the preservation of painted and gilded Christian images, wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. The project aims to shift the focus from religious devotion to cultural heritage, assessing the risk faced by these artifacts and examining the impact of historical events such as the breaks with the church in Rome led by Gustav I in Sweden and Christian III in Denmark-Norway.\n\nThrough the utilization of technologies from natural sciences, the project will provide an analytical overview of approximately 150 polychromed objects, collect material data, map restorations and repairs, and lay the foundation for multidisciplinary studies on these artifacts. By understanding the damages incurred by these objects and their link to iconoclastic acts, the project aims to inform future conservation efforts and training priorities. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the preservation of Nordic cultural heritage and stimulate a debate on heritage values and the future care of these significant artifacts. This project seeks to fill the research gap on the status, volatility, and repairs of these objects, addressing challenges such as the lack of archival evidence and masking of information by secondary paints.",
        "The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\n\nThe proposed project, POLYCHROME, focuses on the survival of painted, gilded, and wooden polychromed Christian images in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden since the Reformation. By analyzing c. 150 objects and collecting material data, this project aims to assess the risk to cultural heritage posed by iconoclastic acts, accidents, and vandalism. The study will address the lack of archival evidence and challenges posed by secondary paints masking valuable information. By utilizing technologies from the natural sciences, the project seeks to establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and foster a debate on heritage values and future care.\n\nThe research will shed light on the impact of historical events such as the break with the church in Rome by leaders like Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway in the 16th century. The ultimate goal is to understand the preserving effects of Lutheranism on these objects and influence training priorities in heritage conservation. This project will contribute significantly to the field by bridging the gap in knowledge regarding the status, volatility, and repairs of Nordic polychromed heritage, ultimately transforming our understanding of these cultural artifacts.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate \"The Survival of Damaged Medieval Polychromed Heritage in the Nordics\" through the POLYCHROME project. Focusing on painted, gilded, and wooden sculptures among other artifacts, the study will span the timeframe since the Reformation in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The project aims to assess the risk to cultural heritage, particularly in the context of historical events such as the break with the church in Rome led by Gustav I in Sweden and Christian III in Denmark-Norway. By addressing the research gap concerning the status, volatility, and repairs of these objects, the hypothesis of damage linked to iconoclastic acts will be explored. Despite challenges like lack of archival evidence and masked information from secondary paints, the methodology will employ technologies from the natural sciences. The objectives include analyzing around 150 polychromed objects, collecting material data, mapping restorations, and fostering interdisciplinary studies. The expected outcomes include understanding the preserving effects of Lutheranism and influencing training priorities. Ultimately, this project aims to elucidate the causes of damages to Nordic polychromed Christian images to inform future care and preservation efforts."
