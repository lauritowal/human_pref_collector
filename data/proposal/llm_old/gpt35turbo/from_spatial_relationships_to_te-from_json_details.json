        "This grant proposal, titled \"From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding,\" aims to investigate the role of gamma waves in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the context of predictive coding within the visual cortex. The project will focus on the frequency range of gamma waves (30-80 Hz) and their importance in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, with a specific emphasis on their implications for neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\nThe study will test the predictive coding theory, which posits the existence of top-down predictions, bottom-up prediction errors, learning mechanisms, and updating of priors. By exploring both standard views (gamma waves carrying prediction errors) and new hypotheses (gamma waves signaling match between predictions and sensory inputs, long-range gamma synchronization predicting visual inputs), the project aims to develop a new method for quantifying predictions and prediction errors in natural vision.\n\nUsing deep-learning networks for prediction, multi-areal recordings, and MEG technology, the study will involve marmosets and humans as subjects to test variables such as predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns. The project will also utilize optogenetics to investigate the impact of gamma waves on driving perceptual learning. The anticipated outcome is the establishment of a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"From spatial relationships to temporal correlations: New vistas on predictive coding,\" aims to investigate the role of gamma waves in cortical communication and synaptic plasticity, particularly within the visual cortex. The project will focus on understanding how gamma waves encode information, contribute to predictive coding, and impact conditions such as neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\nThe study will delve into predictive coding theory, exploring top-down predictions, bottom-up prediction errors, learning mechanisms, and updating priors. It will challenge the standard view that gamma waves solely carry prediction errors by proposing a new hypothesis that suggests they reflect the match between predictions and sensory inputs, as well as engage in long-range synchronization to predict visual inputs.\n\nUsing deep-learning networks, multi-areal recordings, and MEG technology, the project will involve testing predictability and gamma wave synchronization patterns in marmosets and humans. An optogenetics approach will be used to examine how gamma waves drive perceptual learning. The anticipated outcome is to provide evidence for a new unified theory of gamma waves in information transmission and sensory evidence integration. By developing a new method to quantify predictions and prediction errors in natural vision, this project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of cortical communication and predictive coding mechanisms.",
