        "The project \"In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\" aims to explore the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, focusing on power dynamics, legitimacy, sustainability, and the potential for new models supporting decentralized decision-making. This project, titled BlockchainGov, will bring together experts from computer science, political science, and law to investigate governance at both community and global levels.\n\nThe objectives of this research include studying existing blockchain systems, analyzing power dynamics within these systems, evaluating the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance, exploring the potential for new governance models enabled by blockchain, and experimenting with these models across different governance levels.\n\nThe potential outcomes of BlockchainGov are significant, including the opening of a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing both empirical and theoretical contributions to the scientific community, and offering policy implications for global governance.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project requires funding through a high-risk/high-gain scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills. By supporting BlockchainGov, funders will contribute to advancing our understanding of how blockchain technology can shape the future of governance.",
        "The project \"In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\" aims to explore the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, with a focus on power dynamics, legitimacy, sustainability, and the potential for new models supporting decentralized decision-making. This multidisciplinary study will involve experts in computer science, political science, and law to investigate existing blockchain systems, analyze power dynamics within these systems, and examine the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance. The project will also explore the potential of blockchain technology for creating new governance models and will experiment with these models at various governance levels, from community to global.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research include opening a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing empirical and theoretical contributions to science, and offering policy implications for global governance. To achieve these outcomes, the project requires a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills. By addressing these key characteristics, the project aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of blockchain technology's impact on governance and to explore innovative ways of enhancing decision-making processes in various governance contexts.",
        "The project \"In Blockchain We Trust(Less): The Future of Distributed Governance\" aims to explore the impact of blockchain technology on governance structures, with a focus on power dynamics, legitimacy, sustainability, and the potential for new decentralized decision-making models. This interdisciplinary project will bring together experts from computer science, political science, and law to investigate existing blockchain systems, analyze power dynamics within these systems, and assess the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance. Additionally, the project will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new governance models and experiment with these models at various governance levels, from community to global.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research include opening a new field of scholarship on distributed governance, providing empirical and theoretical contributions to science, and offering policy implications for global governance. To achieve these outcomes, the project requires a high-risk/high-gain funding scheme, a dedicated and motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills, and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of traditional governance research. By shedding light on the future of distributed governance in the age of blockchain technology, this project has the potential to shape the way we think about governance and decision-making in the digital era."
