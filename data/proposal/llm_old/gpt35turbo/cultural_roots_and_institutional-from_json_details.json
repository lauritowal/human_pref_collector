        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the cultural roots and institutional transformations impacting teachers' careers and the teaching profession in Europe. The project will focus on the educational systems of Belgium, France, and England, addressing issues such as low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. Through a systematic comparative approach, the research aims to explain the nature of teacher policies, understand changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration.\n\nThe methodology will involve a post-comparative mixed-method design with work packages on teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. Data will be collected from national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility. Participant groups will include non-entrants and early leavers from the profession. The project outputs will contribute new theoretical knowledge and lead to a reconceptualization of institutional change in the teaching profession. By shedding light on the institutional dimensions affecting teachers' careers, this research will inform policy and practice to improve the attractiveness and sustainability of the teaching profession in Europe.",

Through a systematic comparative approach, the project aims to explain the nature of teacher policies, understand changes in the status of the teaching profession, analyze teacher allocation, and model and predict teacher attrition and migration. \n\nUtilizing a post-comparative mixed-method design, the project will include work packages on teacher policy, supply, labor markets, and mobility. Methods such as policy analysis, secondary data analyses, qualitative studies, multilevel multi-group analyses, and semi-structured interviews will be employed using national and international datasets, as well as original datasets on teacher mobility. \n\nThe project will focus on participant groups including non-entrants and early leavers, with the expected outputs being new theoretical knowledge and a reconceptualization of institutional change in the teaching profession in Europe. By shedding light on the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the profession, this project aims to contribute significantly to the field of education policy and practice."
