        "The proposed project, \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns,\" aims to address a critical gap in early detection and intervention for infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By designing a portable, wireless EEG-based device specifically for newborns, this project seeks to revolutionize the screening process for social predispositions in early infancy. The key characteristics of this project include the development of an EEG-based index of face processing that requires less than 2 minutes of a newborn's visual attention, innovative oscillatory visual presentation, the use of dry electrodes, and an automatic on-line extraction algorithm.\n\nThis project not only has the potential to identify early biomarkers for ASD but also to facilitate early behavioral intervention and enable large-scale screening protocols. Currently, there is a significant market gap as there is no fully portable EEG system available for newborns. The proposed technology includes a wireless EEG device with a low-power design, making it suitable for home testing and research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions.\n\nOverall, this project represents a groundbreaking approach to assessing newborns' social processing abilities by merging an innovative experimental paradigm with portable EEG technology. Through this grant proposal, we aim to make significant strides in early detection and intervention for infants at risk for ASD, ultimately improving outcomes for these vulnerable populations.",
        "The \"Portable EEG-based screening of social predispositions in newborns\" grant proposal aims to develop a cutting-edge, wireless EEG device for newborns that enables easy, rapid, and automatic testing of face processing in any context. This innovative project will create an early, objective EEG-based biomarker for newborns at risk, requiring less than 2 minutes of visual attention.\n\nThe device will feature an EEG-based index of face processing, innovative oscillatory visual presentation, and dry electrodes, along with an automatic on-line extraction algorithm. By filling a critical market gap with no fully portable EEG system for newborns currently available, this project has the potential to revolutionize the identification of ASD biomarkers and facilitate early behavioral intervention for ASD.\n\nThe proposed technology includes a wireless EEG device with a low-power design, making it suitable for home testing and research on the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions. Ultimately, this project will merge an innovative experimental paradigm with portable EEG technology to assess newborns' social processing abilities, offering a unique opportunity to advance early screening protocols and improve outcomes for at-risk newborns.",
