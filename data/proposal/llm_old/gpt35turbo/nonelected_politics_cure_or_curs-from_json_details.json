        "The project \"Non-elected politics: Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\" seeks to explore the impact of delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. With a focus on key features such as growing disengagement of citizens from politics, historically low electoral turnout, rise of anti-establishment and populist parties, declining trust in representative institutions, and institutional reforms for democracy revitalization, this research aims to address the paradox of delegating decision-making powers while maintaining the tenets of elected control in representative democracy.\n\nThrough detailed study of European preferences for democratic function and reforms, a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and analysis of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy, the project will employ online survey experiments and panel surveys to investigate the central hypothesis that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. The societal implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential to inform future policy decisions and political reforms aimed at addressing the current crisis of representative democracy in Europe.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Non-elected politics: Cure or Curse for the Crisis of Representative Democracy?\", aims to investigate the impact of delegating political decision-making powers to selected citizens and experts on the crisis of representative democracy in Europe. The project will focus on key characteristics such as the growing disengagement of citizens from politics, historically low electoral turnout, the rise of anti-establishment and populist parties, declining trust in representative institutions, and the need for institutional reforms for democracy revitalization. \n\nThe central hypothesis of this research is that non-elected politics has no universal effect on support for representative democracy. To test this hypothesis, the project will collect data through online survey experiments and panel surveys, with a focus on studying European preferences for democratic function and reforms, creating a comprehensive inventory of citizen and expert empowerment cases since 2000, and analyzing the impact of exposure to non-elected politics on attitudes towards representative democracy. \n\nThe societal implications of this research are far-reaching, as it will provide valuable insights into the potential role of non-elected actors in shaping the future of democracy in Europe. By shedding light on this complex issue, the project aims to contribute to the ongoing debate on democratic governance and the challenges facing representative democracy in the 21st century.",
