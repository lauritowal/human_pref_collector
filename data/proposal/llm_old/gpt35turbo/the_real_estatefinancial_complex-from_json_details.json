        "The Real Estate/Financial Complex grant proposal seeks to address the under-researched connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement by proposing a new metaphor to focus on these interactions. The project, starting in 2007, aims to explore the complex relationship between the real estate and financial sectors, as well as the role of the state in shaping this dynamic. \n\nThe research will focus on internationally comparative studies, examining both quantitative and qualitative shifts in the real estate/financial complex. The project will involve a Postdoc researcher conducting in-depth research on these shifts, while three PhD students will be responsible for national mappings and local/urban case studies in two countries per student. The Principal Investigator will guide the project with a focus on qualitative shifts in real estate, finance, and state involvement, as well as the global dimensions of the complex.\n\nBy shedding light on the intricate connections between real estate, finance, and state intervention, this project aims to contribute valuable insights to the field. The proposed research components and tasks are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the real estate/financial complex and its implications on a global scale.",
        "The Real Estate/Financial Complex grant proposal aims to investigate the intricate connections between real estate, finance, and state involvement, utilizing a novel metaphor to frame the research. This project, starting in 2007, seeks to fill research gaps by exploring the relationship between real estate and finance, as well as the interplay between different scales within this complex. \n\nThe proposed research components include internationally comparative studies by a Postdoc focusing on quantitative and qualitative shifts, as well as involvement of three PhD students who will conduct national mappings and local/urban case studies across two countries each. The Principal Investigator will lead the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance, and state roles, while also delving into the global dimensions of the complex and its conceptualization.\n\nBy addressing these under-researched connections, this project aims to shed light on the dynamics of the real estate/financial complex and its implications. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will provide valuable insights into how these sectors interact and influence each other, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the complexities at play.",
        "The Real Estate/Financial Complex project aims to investigate the intricate relationships between real estate, finance, and state involvement, starting from the pivotal year of 2007. This proposal seeks to fill the existing research gap by exploring the connections between real estate and finance, as well as the interplay between different scales within this complex system. The project will introduce a novel metaphor, the \"real estate/financial complex,\" to conceptualize and analyze these interactions.\n\nThe research components of the project include internationally comparative studies led by a Postdoc, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative shifts in the complex. Additionally, three PhD students will conduct national mappings and local/urban case studies in two countries each. The Principal Investigator will delve into the qualitative shift towards real estate, finance, and state involvement, while also considering the global dimensions of the complex.\n\nBy shedding light on these under-researched connections, this project aims to advance understanding in the field and contribute to the conceptualization of the real estate/financial complex. Ultimately, the findings from this research will provide valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and practitioners in navigating and addressing the complexities of these intertwined sectors."
