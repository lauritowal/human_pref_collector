        "The grant proposal, titled \"The Asian Origins of Global Capitalism: European Factories in the Indian Ocean, 1500-1800\", aims to explore the origins of modern industrial capitalism by focusing on the economic activities in Asian ports controlled by European East India companies during the time period of 1500-1800. The project will investigate the interactive roles of European and local merchants in these imperial trading centers, mapping the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information to recast the narrative of global economic change and capitalism.\n\nKey concepts to be explored include factories, factors, intercontinental trade, spatial theory of capitalist development, New History of Capitalism, and decolonization of the history of capitalism. The methodology involves the integration of large archival repositories and collaborations globally, with a project duration of 5 years.\n\nThe proposed research will investigate over 150 factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development, shedding light on the economic dynamism and global trade that shaped the early stages of modern capitalism. By uncovering the overlooked role of Asian ports in the development of global capitalism, this project seeks to contribute a new perspective to the understanding of economic history and its implications for contemporary global economies.",

The project aims to investigate the economic dynamism of this era by studying the intercontinental trade, spatial theory of capitalist development, and decolonization of the history of capitalism.\n\nKey research questions include understanding the economic activities in imperial trading centres and the interactive roles of European and local merchants. The project aims to map the intercontinental movement of goods, people, and information, with the goal of recasting the narrative of global economic change and capitalism.\n\nMethodologically, the project will integrate large archival repositories and collaborate globally to access and analyze historical data. The project is set to span a duration of 5 years, with a primary focus on investigating over 150 factories as the foundation for a new spatial theory of capitalist development.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to the understanding of the early roots of global capitalism and shed light on the interconnectedness of economic activities in the Indian Ocean region during the early modern period."
