        "The proposed project, \"Biomarkers of individual differences in human cortical visual processing,\" aims to investigate how vision is influenced by physiological state and personality traits. By utilizing innovative methods such as pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics, the study seeks to identify how behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits in normally sighted individuals, including young children. \n\nThe project's unique approach involves combining visual processing measures with physiological interventions, specifically focusing on ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity. The expected outcomes include the discovery of new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolism.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are significant, as it could potentially change the understanding of pervasive developmental disorders, aid in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and encourage therapeutic approaches that affect general physiology. As vision is one of the best understood systems of the human brain, bridging the gap in knowledge regarding why normally sighted individuals perceive differently could provide valuable insights into the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception. This project has the potential to advance our understanding of human visual processing and its connection to individual differences, ultimately leading to new avenues for diagnosis and treatment in various populations.",

By utilizing innovative methods such as pupil responses, ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance imaging of the human visual cortex, and psychophysics, the study seeks to uncover how behavioral and cortical properties co-vary with personality traits. The project will also explore the impact of interventions such as ketosis induced by fasting and intense physical activity on visual processing.\n\nThe potential impacts of this research are far-reaching, with implications for understanding pervasive developmental disorders, aiding in the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, and informing therapeutic approaches that target general physiology. By combining visual processing measures with physiological interventions, the project aims to provide new reliable biomarkers for local context-independent perception and demonstrate evidence of perceptual style changes within individuals due to metabolism.\n\nThrough this investigation into the relationship between metabolism, cortical processing, and perception within the visual system, the project aims to fill a critical gap in understanding why normally sighted individuals perceive differently. Ultimately, this research has the potential to advance our knowledge of the human brain and inform future interventions for individuals with visual processing differences.",
