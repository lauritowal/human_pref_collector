        "The \"Principles of Musical Structure Building: Theory, Computation, and Cognition\" grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of human cognition by focusing on complex auditory sequences and syntactic structures in music perception. The project encompasses three key strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental. \n\nThe theoretical strand seeks to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that surpasses context-free complexity, with a specific focus on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints. Current approaches are limited to harmonic syntax and rely on tree-based context-free grammars, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive framework.\n\nThe computational aspect of the project involves compiling and publishing a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses, implementing a unified syntax theory based on generalized parsing and graph grammars, and evaluating these through analytical corpus-based training and assessment.\n\nFinally, the experimental strand aims to test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension. By bridging theoretical, computational, and experimental domains, this project will make significant contributions to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences, shedding light on the intricate processes involved in perceiving and understanding musical structures.",

This project will explore three key strands: theoretical, computational, and experimental.\n\nIn the theoretical strand, the objective is to develop a novel unified theory of musical syntax that exceeds context-free complexity, with a focus on harmonic structure and voice leading constraints. Current approaches are limited to harmonic syntax and context-free grammars, which this project seeks to surpass.\n\nThe computational aspect involves compiling and publishing a large corpus of digitized syntactic analyses based on a unified syntax theory using generalized parsing and graph grammars. This will be followed by analytical corpus-based training and evaluation.\n\nThe experimental component aims to test specific predictions about mental representations of musical structure, focusing on nonlocal dependency relations, learnability, revision, and tension.\n\nThe proposed project will contribute to the fields of music cognition and cognitive sciences by providing a comprehensive investigation into the principles of musical structure building, bridging theory, computation, and cognition.
