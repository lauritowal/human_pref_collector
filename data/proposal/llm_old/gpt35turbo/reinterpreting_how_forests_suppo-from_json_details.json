        "The proposed project, \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries,\" aims to address the global issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting a population of 2 billion individuals. While current solutions focus on increasing agricultural production and access to calories, there is a blind spot in understanding the role of forests in supporting dietary diversification. Forests provide a range of benefits including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which in turn contribute to the production of meat, milk, eggs, and manure.\n\nThe project goals include identifying the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, developing a framework on forest-diet linkages, and providing empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality. The approach will be multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich, with methodologies that explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes, identify hotspots through linking household food consumption data with forest metrics, and conduct in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes.\n\nWith fieldwork locations in two countries, the expected outcome of the project is a shift in the conceptualization of food security to include the vital role of forests in supporting dietary diversity and quality in low-income settings. This research will contribute valuable insights to inform policies and interventions aimed at improving nutrition outcomes in these regions.",
        "The grant proposal \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\" aims to address the global issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting approximately 2 billion people.

        "The proposed project, \"Reinterpreting how forests support people's dietary quality in low-income countries\", aims to address the global issue of nutrient deficiencies affecting over 2 billion people, with a focus on dietary diversification. Despite efforts to increase agricultural production and access to calories, the role of forests in supporting dietary quality remains a blind spot. Forests offer a variety of benefits including wild foods, high-value products, and fodder for livestock, which in turn produce meat, milk, eggs, and manure.\n\nThe project goals include identifying the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on dietary quality, developing a framework on forest-diet linkages, and providing empirical evidence of forests' influence on dietary quality. The approach will be multi-scale, multi-country, and data-rich, with methodologies that explore forest loss, fragmentation, and dietary changes from a broad scale perspective, identify hotspots by linking household food consumption data with forest metrics, and conduct in-depth fieldwork to elucidate causal relations between forests and dietary outcomes.\n\nWith fieldwork locations in two countries, the project aims to bring about a shift in the conceptualization of food security by highlighting the critical role of forests in supporting dietary quality in low-income countries. This research will contribute valuable insights to inform policy and interventions aimed at improving nutrition and food security for vulnerable populations."
