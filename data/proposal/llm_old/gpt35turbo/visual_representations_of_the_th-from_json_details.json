        "The proposed project, \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,\" aims to conduct a historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the timeframe of 1855-1959. With a death toll of 12,000,000, the Third Plague Pandemic had a significant impact on various regions including China and Japan, India, Africa, and South and North America.\n\nUtilizing photography as a key technology influence, the project will focus on the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses, burial, as well as race, class, and discrimination. The research team will consist of a principal investigator and three postdoctoral researchers working full-time to explore the visual narratives and cultural responses to the pandemic across different regions.\n\nThrough the analysis of visual materials, the project aims to uncover how the pandemic was represented and interpreted in diverse cultural contexts, shedding light on the complex interplay between visual culture and historical events. By examining the role of photography in shaping public perceptions and responses to the pandemic, the project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the sociocultural dynamics of global health crises.\n\nOverall, this project will provide valuable insights into the ways in which visual representations can inform our understanding of past pandemics and their lasting impact on societies worldwide.",
        "The proposed project, \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,\" aims to conduct a historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the timeframe of 1855-1959. With a death toll of 12,000,000, the project will focus on the influence of photography as a technology in capturing and disseminating images related to the pandemic.\n\nThe regions in focus include China and Japan, India, Africa, South and North America, reflecting the widespread impact of the pandemic. The project team will consist of one principal investigator and three postdoctoral researchers, all employed full-time to ensure comprehensive research coverage.\n\nKey analysis aspects of the project will include examining the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses, and burial practices, as well as issues of race, class, and discrimination as depicted in visual representations of the third plague pandemic.\n\nThrough this research, the project aims to shed light on the ways in which visual representations shaped perceptions and responses to the pandemic across different regions and social contexts. By uncovering the nuances and complexities of these representations, the project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural dimensions of global health crises.\n\nOverall, this grant proposal seeks funding to support a critical examination of the visual culture surrounding the third plague pandemic, offering valuable insights into the intersection of photography, public health, and societal responses to infectious diseases.",
        "The proposed project, \"Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic,\" aims to conduct a historical and anthropological analysis of the global network of visual representations during the timeframe of 1855-1959. This period saw a devastating death toll of 12,000,000 individuals due to the plague, making it a critical era for understanding the impact of such a widespread disease on various regions across the world.\n\nThe project will focus on the influence of photography as a technology that shaped the ways in which the pandemic was documented and represented. Regions in focus will include China and Japan, India, Africa, South and North America, providing a comprehensive view of how different cultures and societies responded to the crisis. The research team, consisting of one principal investigator and three postdoctoral researchers, will work full-time to analyze key aspects such as the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death, corpses, and burial practices, as well as issues of race, class, and discrimination.\n\nBy examining visual representations from diverse perspectives, this project seeks to uncover the socio-cultural implications of the third plague pandemic and how it was interpreted and portrayed globally. The findings from this research have the potential to contribute valuable insights to the fields of history, anthropology, and public health, shedding light on the ways in which visual media shape our understanding of disease outbreaks and their societal impact."
