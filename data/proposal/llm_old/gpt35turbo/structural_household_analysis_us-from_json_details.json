        "This grant proposal, titled \"Structural Household Analysis using Revealed Preferences\", aims to revolutionize the understanding of household consumption patterns through non-unitary modeling techniques. The project will utilize an empirical toolkit based on revealed preference methodology with a nonparametric approach to analyze household consumption behavior. The key contributions of this research include the integration of marriage market dynamics into structural modeling and the incorporation of revealed preference restrictions with nonparametric estimation of demand systems.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to open the intrahousehold black box using aggregate consumption information, avoid parametric assumptions on decision processes, describe intrahousehold decision processes, and analyze household consumption patterns. By addressing challenges such as unobserved heterogeneity across households and the limited power of revealed preference restrictions, this research will provide valuable insights into the complexities of household decision-making.\n\nUtilizing pooled cross-section data sets, this project will shed light on the intricacies of household consumption behavior and pave the way for more accurate and comprehensive modeling techniques in the field.",
