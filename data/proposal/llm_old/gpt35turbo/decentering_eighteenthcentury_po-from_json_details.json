        "The proposed project, \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire,\" seeks to reevaluate the early history of European political economy through a practical lens, focusing on measures and policies for betterment rather than modern theoretical frameworks. With a primary focus on the eighteenth-century political economy of the Swedish empire, the project will also examine other cases for broader applicability.\n\nKey concepts such as improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare will be explored within various discursive production sites including universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The hypothesis driving this research is that activities within each of these sites were aimed at enhancing the organization of the state and society, as well as improving the living conditions of the people.\n\nBy rethinking traditional narratives and perspectives on economic history, this project aims to shed new light on the practices and policies of the past that shaped the economic landscape of the eighteenth century. Through a multidisciplinary approach that integrates historical analysis with economic theory, this research has the potential to provide valuable insights for contemporary economic debates and policy-making processes.",
        "The project \"De-Centering Eighteenth-Century Political Economy: Rethinking Growth, Wealth and Welfare in the Swedish Empire\" seeks to challenge traditional narratives of European political economy by shifting the focus to practical concerns and policies aimed at improvement rather than theoretical models. This study will specifically delve into the eighteenth-century political economy of the Swedish Empire, examining measures and policies implemented for societal betterment.\n\nBy exploring activities in key discursive production sites such as universities, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals, the project aims to demonstrate how these efforts were directed towards enhancing the organization of the state and society, as well as improving the living conditions of the populace. Through a comparative approach involving other cases, the research will strive to draw broader implications and applicability of the findings.\n\nThis innovative approach to studying political economy in a historical context will contribute valuable insights to the field, challenging conventional perspectives and offering a fresh interpretation of the early history of European political economy. By reassessing key concepts such as improvement, wealth, growth, and welfare within the specific context of the Swedish Empire, this project has the potential to reshape our understanding of this crucial period in economic history.",
