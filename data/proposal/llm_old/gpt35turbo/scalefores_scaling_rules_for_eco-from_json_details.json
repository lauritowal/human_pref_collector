        "The proposed project, SCALEFORES: Scaling Rules For Ecosystem Service Mapping, aims to develop and test a novel methodological framework for mapping relationships between ecosystem services using existing data. By addressing the challenge of reliably mapping relationships between multiple ecosystem services, this project seeks to enable multifunctional, ecosystem service-based management of landscapes. The methods employed will focus on examining the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and underpinning social and ecological variables, as well as creating maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The validation process will involve comparing the methodology against existing maps of ecosystem services in Europe. Anticipated outcomes include accurate maps of relationships between ecosystem services and an increased ability to map distributions of ecosystem services. The project will utilize data sources such as land cover, soil type, and human population density, with a specific focus on the region of Europe due to its wealth of data on ecosystem services. Overall, this project has the potential to significantly advance the field of ecosystem service mapping and inform more effective landscape management strategies.",
