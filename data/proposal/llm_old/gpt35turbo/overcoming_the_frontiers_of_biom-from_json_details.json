        "The grant proposal titled \"Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics\" seeks to push the boundaries of biomolecular research in understanding human evolution and adaptation through the innovative application of palaeoproteomics. The project acronym BACKWARD outlines its key objectives of developing new palaeoproteomic workflows and utilizing advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions.\n\nThe aims of the project include addressing African and Asian extinct hominid phylogeny, extending molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA limits, and reconstructing the evolutionary history of species extinct millions of years ago. By employing palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing, the project targets phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe potential applications of this research are vast, including the identification of processes related to human brain expansion and reorganization, as well as species and sex identification from isolated fossil fragments. Furthermore, the project aims to have a commercial impact in areas such as forensic medicine, the food industry, and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThrough a collaborative effort among participating institutions, this project aims to have a transformative impact comparable to the revolution seen in ancient DNA research over the past two decades.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Overcoming the frontiers of biomolecular studies on human history and adaptation using palaeoproteomics,\" aims to push the boundaries of biomolecular research by leveraging palaeoproteomics to explore human evolution and adaptation. The project, known as BACKWARD, seeks to develop a new generation of palaeoproteomic workflows and utilize advanced mass spectrometry and bioinformatic solutions to address key objectives.\n\nSpecifically, the project aims to delve into African and Asian extinct hominid phylogeny, extend molecular-based phylogeny beyond ancient DNA limits, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of species extinct millions of years ago. This will be achieved through the application of palaeoproteomics and mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing to study phylogenetic relationships among South African early hominins and hominid palaeobiodiversity in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will not only contribute to our understanding of human evolution and adaptation but also have practical applications in fields such as forensic medicine, the food industry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Through a collaborative effort involving multiple institutions, this project aims to leave a transformative legacy similar to the impact ancient DNA research has had over the past two decades.",
