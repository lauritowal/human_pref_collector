        "The proposed project, titled \"Beyond East and West: Developing and Documenting an Evolving Transcultural Musical Practice,\" aims to integrate Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music. The key objectives include training traditional instrumentalists and singers in new repertoire, as well as Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques. The project also seeks to develop approaches for modeling music's impacts on musicians and audiences, create an ensemble interface with newly designed instruments, and produce studies on timbre. Additionally, the project aims to establish a template for Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nThe activities planned for this project include research workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK, performance training for traditional and Western musicians, development of ensemble interfaces, timbre studies, and mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems. The outputs will include an e-book titled \"Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music,\" an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds, and online audio and visual examples.\n\nThe project will be published by CUP and aims to serve as a model for transcultural musical practice and overcoming cultural barriers. Through this project, the team hopes to contribute to the evolution of a truly transcultural musical practice that bridges the divide between East and West in the realm of music.",
