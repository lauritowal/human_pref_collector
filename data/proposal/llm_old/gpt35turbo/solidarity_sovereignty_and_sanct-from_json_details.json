        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s\". The project aims to explore the experiences of boat refugees, with a focus on the influence of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary on their journeys and reception.\n\nThe proposal will investigate the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum through sea routes, spanning various decades and regions such as the Mediterranean, South China Sea, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean. By examining the interactions between boat refugees and various actors, including states, non-state actors, and the broader public, the project seeks to answer the central research question: \"How did notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary influence the experience and reception of boat refugees across time and space?\"\n\nKey research points include examining solidarity among boat refugees, encounters with non-state actors, state responses to boat refugees at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary post-journey. The project will utilize a variety of sources such as interviews with boat refugees and actors, oral histories, archival collections, legal cases, and media coverage.\n\nWith a focus on critical themes such as 'Thinking through seas', 'Going beyond the state', and 'Comparing across time and space', this project aims to provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by boat refugees and the role of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping their experiences.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s,\" aims to explore the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum via sea routes. With an estimated count of one million boat refugees in 2015, the project will focus on key periods such as the 1940s Mediterranean Jewish refugees, the 1970s and 1980s Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea, the 1980s and 1990s Cuban and Haitian refugees in the Caribbean, and the 1990s and 2000s refugees heading to Australia, Yemen, and Europe through the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean.\n\nThe central research question of the project is to understand how notions of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary have influenced the experience and reception of boat refugees across different times and locations. By investigating who hindered and who helped boat refugees on their journeys, the project seeks to uncover the dynamics of solidarity among boat refugees, encounters with non-state actors, state responses at sea, and the attainment of sanctuary post-journey.\n\nUtilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the project will draw on various sources such as interviews with boat refugees and non-state actors, oral history, state archives, NGO archival collections, legal cases, and contemporary media coverage. By \"thinking through seas,\" \"going beyond the state,\" and \"comparing across time and space,\" the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding boat refugee experiences. Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute to the broader discourse on migration, asylum, and humanitarianism.",
        "The proposed project, \"Solidarity, Sovereignty, and Sanctuary on the Seas: A Global History of Boat Refugees since the 1940s,\" aims to explore the historical patterns of boat refugees seeking asylum via sea routes, focusing on the influences of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary on their experiences and outcomes. This project will delve into the central research question of how these notions have shaped the reception and treatment of boat refugees across different time periods and geographical locations. \n\nWith a dataset of approximately 1,000,000 boat refugees since the 1940s, the project will examine key periods such as the Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean in the 1940s, the Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Cuban and Haitian refugees in the Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s. Furthermore, it will investigate the destinations and routes taken by boat refugees in the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and Mediterranean from the 1990s to 2000s.\n\nThe research will focus on understanding the dynamics of solidarity among boat refugees, interactions with non-state actors, responses from state authorities, and the attainment of sanctuary after their arduous journeys. By comparing these experiences across different time periods and geographic locations, the project aims to shed light on the complexities of asylum-seeking via sea routes and the role of solidarity, sovereignty, and sanctuary in shaping the outcomes for boat refugees. Through a variety of sources including interviews, oral history, state archives, and NGO collections, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by boat refugees and the factors that influence their reception and treatment."
