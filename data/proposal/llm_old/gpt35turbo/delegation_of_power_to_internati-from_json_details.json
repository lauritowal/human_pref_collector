        "The grant proposal titled \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time\" seeks to explore the dynamics of authority transfer to international organizations (IOs) and the impact of institutional empowerment over a specific time period from 1986 to 2010. The project will focus on the increase in IOs receiving varied levels of authority, with examples including the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO-Secretariat, and NATO. Factors influencing empowerment, such as temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design, will be examined using a comparative and longitudinal research design.\n\nUtilizing disciplinary approaches from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology, the research will involve theory-building and hypothesis-testing through qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials. The objective is to gain insights into the consequences of power delegation to IOs and contribute to advancements in theoretical and empirical International Relations research. Ultimately, this project aims to develop a model that integrates the temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach, shedding light on the complexities of power dynamics in the realm of international governance.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the project titled \"Delegation of Power to International Organizations and Institutional Empowerment over Time.\" The project aims to investigate the dynamics of power delegation to international organizations (IOs) over a longitudinal time period from 1986 to 2010. The research will focus on the increase in IOs, varied authority surrendered, and factors influencing empowerment, such as temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design.\n\nUsing a comparative research design, the project will analyze IOs such as the EC/EU, GATT/WTO, IMF, and NATO, utilizing disciplinary approaches from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. The research methods will include qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials.\n\nThe objective of this project is to develop a model of power delegation to IOs that incorporates a temporal dimension into the principal-agent approach. The outcomes of this research will contribute to theoretical and empirical advancements in International Relations research, offering insights into the consequences of power delegation. This project represents a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between states and IOs, ultimately enhancing our knowledge of global governance dynamics.",

The proposal focuses on analyzing the varied levels of authority delegated to IOs such as the EU, IMF, GATT/WTO, and NATO, considering factors like temporal dynamics, cohesion among principals, and institutional design.\n\nThe research design is comparative and longitudinal, utilizing a mix of disciplinary approaches from political science, economics, law, and organizational sociology. The project will involve qualitative work, archives research, and elite interviews with national and international officials as key interview subjects. By incorporating a temporal dimension into the principal-agent model, the objective is to gain insights into the consequences of power delegation to IOs and contribute to theoretical and empirical advancements in International Relations research.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute valuable knowledge on the dynamics of power delegation to IOs, shedding light on the implications for international governance and the role of IOs in global decision-making processes."
