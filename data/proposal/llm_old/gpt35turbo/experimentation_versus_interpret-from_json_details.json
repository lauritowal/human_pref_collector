        "The proposed project, titled \"Experimentation versus Interpretation: exploring New Paths in Music Performance in the Twenty-First Century,\" seeks to investigate the shift from text-based to performative-based musical works and explore experimental performance practices in the context of music performance. The project aims to assess the transferability of the scientific experimentation model to music performance, with a focus on creating new paths through experimental practices.\n\nUsing methodologies such as material engagement in artistic practice and the generation of artistic outputs, the project aims to contribute to innovations in theory and practice, provide opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, and offer concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance. The research will be conducted within the context of Artistic Research, with practical components including theoretical investigation and music practice.\n\nExpected project outputs include a change in the field of musical performance and the development of an alternative to traditional 'interpretation'. The project will be hosted by the Orpheus Research Centre in Music and will contribute to the discourse on Artistic Experimentation. This project has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of music performance by exploring new paths and pushing boundaries in the twenty-first century.",
        "This grant proposal aims to explore new paths in music performance in the twenty-first century by shifting from traditional text-based approaches to experimental and performative-based practices. The project will investigate the transferability of scientific experimentation models to music performance, with a focus on creating innovative pathways through experimental practices. By engaging in material artistic practice and generating new outputs, the project seeks to contribute to advancements in theory and practice within the field of music performance.\n\nThe objectives of this project include challenging traditional conceptions bound to history, creating new paths through experimental practices, and assessing the transferability of scientific experimentation to music. Through a combination of theoretical investigation and music practice, the project will offer concrete examples of alternative approaches to music performance, leading to tangible changes in the field and providing an alternative to traditional 'interpretation'.\n\nThe Orpheus Research Centre in Music will serve as the host institution for this research, which falls within the realm of Artistic Research and related discourse on Artistic Experimentation. The expected contributions of this project include opportunities for scholarship and performance practices, ultimately leading to innovations in the field of music performance.",
