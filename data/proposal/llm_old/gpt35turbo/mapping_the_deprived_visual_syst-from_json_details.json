        "The \"Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction\" (MADVIS) project aims to investigate the impact of visual deprivation on the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. By understanding how different stages of visual deprivation affect brain regions and their function, this project seeks to predict outcomes of sight restoration procedures. The project will study the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight recovery using interdisciplinary methods from cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology. The expected impact of MADVIS includes advancing knowledge of experience-dependent brain shaping, bridging the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration, and developing new tools for predicting sensory restoration outcomes. Ultimately, this project will provide insights into how specific brain regions adapt to the absence of visual input and leverage this understanding to improve predictions for sight restoration procedures.",

        "The \"Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for prediction\" (MADVIS) project aims to investigate how visual deprivation at different developmental stages impacts the organization and connectivity of the occipital cortex. By understanding the relationship between crossmodal plasticity and sight recovery, this project seeks to advance knowledge in the field of experience-dependent shaping of brain regions. Through interdisciplinary methods that combine cognitive neurosciences and ophthalmology, MADVIS will bridge the gap between crossmodal reorganization and sight restoration. \n\nThe objectives of the project include predicting outcomes of sight restoration procedures based on the knowledge gained from studying the effects of visual deprivation. The expected impact of MADVIS includes developing new predictive tools for sensory restoration procedures, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for individuals undergoing sight restoration. This project has the potential to significantly contribute to the field of neuroscience and ophthalmology by shedding light on how specific brain regions adapt their function in the absence of visual input."
