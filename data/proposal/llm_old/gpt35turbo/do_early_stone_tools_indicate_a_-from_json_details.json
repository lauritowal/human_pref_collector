        "The proposed project, titled \"STONECULT: Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture?\" aims to address the pressing scientific question of when forms of culture first arose in our lineage. By investigating early hominin technology and comparing it to modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, the project seeks to test whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions.\n\nUtilizing top-down and bottom-up testing approaches, the project will examine the hypotheses that early stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture (null hypothesis) and that they are best accounted for by the latent solutions model. If the latent solutions model is confirmed, it would suggest that cumulative culture emerged later than currently assumed, transforming our understanding of human culture evolution.\n\nThe potential impact of this research extends to fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. By challenging existing theories and proposing a new account for early stone tools, this project has the potential to reshape our understanding of human cultural evolution.\n\nOverall, this proposal represents a crucial step in advancing our knowledge of early human culture and the mechanisms underlying the development of technological innovations in our lineage.",
        "The proposed project, \"STONECULT: Do early stone tools indicate a hominin ability to accumulate culture?\", seeks to address the fundamental question of when forms of culture first emerged in the human lineage. The project will investigate whether early stone tools reflect cumulative culture or latent solutions, challenging conventional assumptions about the origins of human culture. By comparing modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, the research team will use top-down and bottom-up testing approaches to test hypotheses that early stone tools are not manifestations of cumulative culture and are best explained by the latent solutions model. If confirmed, this could revolutionize our understanding of human culture evolution, informing fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. The project aims to shed light on the social learning mechanisms of early hominins and explore how cultural adaptations were crucial for human colonization of the planet. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform our understanding of the development of human culture, challenging existing paradigms and offering new insights into the origins of complex societies. This proposal represents a groundbreaking effort to test the latent solutions account of early stone tools, paving the way for a deeper exploration of the evolution of human culture.",
        "The proposed project, \"STONECULT,\" seeks to investigate the origins of human culture by examining early stone tools created by hominins. The research question driving this study is focused on determining when forms of culture first emerged in our lineage. The project aims to challenge traditional views by testing the hypothesis that early stone tools were not products of cumulative culture but rather were developed through latent solutions. By comparing modern human technologies and non-human great ape approaches, the researchers will employ both top-down and bottom-up testing approaches to assess the validity of these hypotheses.\n\nIf the latent solutions model is supported, it could revolutionize current understandings of human culture evolution, suggesting that cumulative culture emerged later than previously assumed. The potential impact of this research extends to fields such as anthropology, archaeology, comparative psychology, ethology, and primatology. By shedding light on the mechanisms behind early hominin technology, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of the development of human culture.\n\n\"STONECULT\" represents a novel approach to studying early stone tools and their implications for cultural evolution. This proposal stands at the forefront of scientific inquiry into the origins of human culture, offering a unique opportunity to challenge existing paradigms and expand our knowledge of the factors driving cultural adaptations in our species."
