        "The proposed project, \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin,\" aims to explore how non-human beings shape human cultural life in the context of the Amazon. The project will introduce the concept of \"zoophytography\" to analyze the representation of animals and plants in texts, cinema, and artworks about the Amazon. By tracing the roots of zoophytography to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies as well as Western philosophy, the project will delve into the unique ways in which human cultural productions lend a voice to the non-human entities of the Amazon.\n\nThrough three research streams focusing on Amazonian Zoophytography, Animal Talk, and Flora's Voice, the project will contribute to the fields of environmental humanities, Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies. The outcomes of the project include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, revealing the interdependence of humans and non-humans, drawing attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia, and promoting equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants.\n\nOverall, this project seeks to decenter humanity as the sole source of meaning-making in cultural productions about the Amazon, highlighting the importance of including non-human voices in the discourse surrounding the region's biodiversity and environmental challenges.",
        "The grant proposal \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\" aims to explore how non-human beings, specifically animals and plants, play a significant role in shaping human cultural life in narratives, cinema, and art centered around the Amazon region. The project introduces the concept of zoophytography to analyze the ways in which these non-human entities are portrayed and given voice in cultural productions. \n\nThe research streams within the proposal focus on defining zoophytography, tracing its roots to Indigenous and Western epistemologies, articulating animals in cultural works, and exploring the inscription of plants in various forms of media. By studying these aspects, the project seeks to contribute to fields such as environmental humanities, ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, highlighting the interdependence between humans and non-humans, bringing attention to environmental degradation in the Amazon region, and promoting more equitable perspectives on Amazonian animals and plants. Overall, this project aims to challenge anthropocentric views and emphasize the importance of considering non-human beings in cultural narratives.",
        "The grant proposal \"Animals and Plants in Cultural Productions about the Amazon River Basin\" aims to explore how non-human beings, particularly animals and plants, play a dynamic role in shaping human cultural life in the context of the Amazon region. The project will introduce the concept of \"zoophytography\" to analyze how these non-human entities are represented and given voice in various cultural productions such as texts, cinema, and art.\n\nThrough three research streams focusing on Amazonian Zoophytography, Animal Talk, and Flora’s Voice, the project will delve into the articulation of animals and plants in cultural works, tracing their roots to Indigenous and Western epistemologies. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the fields of environmental humanities, Amazonian ecocriticism, environmental philosophy, and post-colonial studies.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to deepen our understanding of Amazonian fauna and flora, highlight the interdependence between humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in the Amazon region, and promote more equitable views on Amazonian animals and plants. By decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making, this research will shed light on the complex relationships between humans and the natural world in the Amazon River Basin."
