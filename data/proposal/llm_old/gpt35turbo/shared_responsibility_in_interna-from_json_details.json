        "The \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES) grant proposal aims to address the challenges surrounding the allocation of international responsibilities in cooperative actions. The project will focus on rethinking how responsibilities are distributed among various actors in international cooperation to ensure the protection of the international rule of law and provide remedies for injured parties within shared responsibilities. \n\nThe objectives of the project include uncovering the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and developing new perspectives on matching cooperation with a system of responsibility. Key focus areas will involve principles of holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, as well as processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies. \n\nThe approach of the project will be two-fold, utilizing a conceptual and theoretical foundation alongside an empirical approach through case-studies. By exploring the problem of responsibility dilution and proposing solutions for better matching international cooperation with a proper system of shared responsibility, SHARES seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of international law.",

The project will utilize both conceptual and theoretical foundations, as well as an empirical approach through case studies to explore the complexities of determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions. \n\nBy exploring the problem of scattering of responsibilities and providing solutions for better matching international cooperation with a system of shared responsibility, SHARES seeks to contribute to the advancement of international law and enhance accountability in global governance. This project has the potential to offer valuable insights and recommendations for policymakers, scholars, and practitioners working in the field of international law and cooperation.",
        "The \"Shared Responsibility in International Law\" (SHARES) project seeks to address the complex issue of responsibility allocation in international cooperation. The project aims to rethink the current system of assigning responsibilities among actors in cooperative actions, with a focus on protecting the international rule of law and providing remedies for injured parties within shared responsibilities. \n\nKey objectives of the project include uncovering the extent and nature of scattered international responsibilities and developing new perspectives on aligning cooperation with a system of shared responsibility. The project will explore principles for holding multiple actors collectively, jointly, or proportionately responsible, as well as processes for (quasi-)judicial systems to account for collective international policies.\n\nThe proposed approach involves a combination of conceptual and theoretical foundations and empirical case studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions related to shared responsibilities in international law. By shedding light on the complications in determining individual actor responsibility in collective actions and addressing the undermining of key objectives due to shared responsibility, SHARES aims to contribute to a more effective and fair system of international cooperation."
