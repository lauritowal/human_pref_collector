    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, \"INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: what do we learn from French firm-level data?\", aims to explore the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth through an analysis of French firm-level data. The project will investigate the role of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions in driving growth. With a focus on creative destruction, the study will address key research questions such as the impact of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship and the relationship between innovation, trade, and productivity growth.\n\nThis research project will contribute to the understanding of growth factors, including middle income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics. By examining the impact of creative destruction on social mobility and wellbeing, the study will provide insights into the design of effective growth policies. The project aims to bridge the gap between theory and data to inform policy decisions and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of innovation. Through a comprehensive analysis of French firm-level data, this project will shed light on the complex relationship between innovation, growth, and social mobility, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of economic growth.",
        "The proposed project, \"INNOVATION, FIRM DYNAMICS AND GROWTH: what do we learn from French firm-level data?\", aims to investigate the Schumpeterian theory of economic growth using French firm-level data. The project will focus on the role of innovative entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial investments, and economic policies and institutions in fostering growth through creative destruction. \n\nThe research questions will explore topics such as productivity growth measurement, the relationship between innovation and trade, the effects of fiscal and institutional changes on entrepreneurship, and the impact of creative destruction on inequality and wellbeing. The project will also examine aspects such as the middle income trap, secular stagnation, top income inequality, and firm dynamics.\n\nThrough the analysis of firm-level data, the project seeks to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms and policies of innovation, as well as the relationship between innovation, growth, and social mobility. The ultimate goal is to inform growth policy design by providing empirical evidence on the factors that drive economic growth and foster a more dynamic and inclusive economy.",
