    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era,\" aims to investigate the evolution of Buddhism through the analysis of textual material in Indic languages from the first millennium of the Common Era. Recent discoveries at the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand have provided valuable insights into the manuscript type, predominantly the Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts. The geographical coverage of the study includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India.\n\nThrough a combination of philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods, the project will focus on textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks. The expected outputs include the creation of a digital archive, an akṣara database, digital preservation, editions and translations, and feature studies on textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. Additionally, content comparison across multiple languages will be conducted.\n\nThis project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the development of Buddhism in Greater Gandhāra and shed light on the manuscript networks in the region during the first millennium of the Common Era. The findings will be valuable for scholars and researchers interested in Buddhist textuality and manuscript traditions.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding to support a project titled \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era.\" The project focuses on the development of Buddhism through the study of textual material in Indic languages during the first millennium of the Common Era. Recent discoveries, such as those at the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand, have provided new insights into the field.\n\nThe research will primarily involve philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods to study textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks of Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts. The geographical coverage includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India. The project aims to create a digital archive, an akṣara database, and digital preservation of the manuscripts. Additionally, editions and translations will be produced, along with feature studies on textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. A content comparison, including multi-language analysis, will also be conducted.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute significantly to the understanding of Buddhist textuality and manuscript networks in Greater Gandhāra during the first millennium of the Common Era.",
        "The proposed project, \"Corpora in Greater Gandhāra: Tracing the Development of Buddhist Textuality and Gilgit/Bamiyan Manuscript Networks in the First Millennium of the Common Era,\" aims to explore the evolution of Buddhism through the study of textual material in Indic languages from the first millennium CE. Recent discoveries at the Mes Aynak archaeological site in Afghanistan and a private collection in Thailand have provided new insights into the Gilgit/Bamiyan type sūtra manuscripts. The project will employ philological, paleographical, codicological, and critical research methods to investigate textual and material production, transmission, and relationship networks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Northern India.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will include the creation of a digital archive, an akṣara database, and digital preservation efforts. Additionally, the project will produce editions and translations of the manuscripts, as well as feature studies on textual, paleographical, and codicological aspects. A key component of the project will be the comparison of content across multiple languages to uncover linguistic and cultural connections. By shedding light on the development of Buddhist textuality in Greater Gandhāra, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the spread and evolution of Buddhism in the first millennium CE."
