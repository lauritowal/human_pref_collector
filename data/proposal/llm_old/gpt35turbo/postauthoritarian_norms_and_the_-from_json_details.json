        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a research project titled \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships.\" The project aims to explore the impact of ideological associations with past authoritarian regimes on political norms in new democracies. By focusing on countries like Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, the study will use survey experiments to investigate how these associations shape political positions for voters and parties. The theoretical contributions of this research include the development of a new theory on the rejection of the ideological brand of past authoritarian regimes. The expected outputs include a new theory explaining political competition heterogeneity across new democracies. The inquiry will specifically focus on issues such as the decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the higher likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. By investigating voters' avoidance of past dictatorship ideologies and their impact on party competition, this project aims to shed light on citizens' ideological preferences, perceptions of party stances, national identity, political discussions, and the supply of new parties in post-transition democracies.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships,\" aims to examine the impact of past authoritarian regimes on the political landscape of new democracies. The project will focus on countries such as Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, using survey experiments as research methods. The theoretical contributions of the study will include a new theory explaining political competition heterogeneity across new democracies. Key issues to be investigated include voters' avoidance of association with past dictatorship ideologies, the impact on party competition, citizens' ideological preferences, perceptions of party stances, national identity, and the supply of new parties. The expected outputs of the research will provide insights into the rejection of past authoritarian regime ideologies and their influence on political positions for voters and parties. By analyzing the left-wing party decline in Poland, delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and higher likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the ideological legacy of dictatorships in shaping political norms in new democracies.",
        "The grant proposal \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" aims to investigate the impact of past authoritarian regimes on political norms in new democracies. Through survey experiments conducted in Poland, Portugal, and Eastern Europe between 2015 and 2019, the project will focus on the rejection of ideological associations with the previous regimes. Theoretical contributions will include a new theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition in new democracies. The research will specifically examine the decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the delayed emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the higher likelihood of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. By investigating issues such as voters' avoidance of past dictatorship ideologies, the impact on party competition, citizens' ideological preferences, and national identity, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of post-authoritarian political systems. The expected outputs include a new theory that explains the complexities of political competition in new democracies."
