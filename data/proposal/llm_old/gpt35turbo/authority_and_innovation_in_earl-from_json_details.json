        "The grant proposal titled \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\" aims to delve into the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by focusing on early Franciscan thought. This project seeks to challenge the prevailing notion that early Franciscans were mere compilers of past work and instead highlights their innovative contributions to philosophical discourse. \n\nThe methodology employed in this study involves implementing a 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach to reading scholastic texts, which considers the impact of practice on theoretical developments. The objectives of the project include producing a comprehensive study of early Franciscan thought, identifying novel elements in their work, establishing connections between early and late Franciscan schools, and showcasing the shared philosophical identity between Muslim and Western traditions. \n\nThe expected outcome of this research is a nuanced scholarly account of the Franciscan origins of modern Western thought. By emphasizing how Franciscan ideas evolved into modern concepts when removed from their original practice-led context, this project aims to advance the understanding of scholasticism and redefine the current state of the art in this field. Ultimately, this grant proposal seeks to uncover hidden gems of innovation in early Franciscan thought and shed new light on their lasting impact on Western philosophy.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Authority and Innovation in Early Franciscan Thought (c. 1220-56)\" aims to deepen our understanding of the medieval origins of modern Western philosophy by focusing on early Franciscan thought. This project challenges the prevailing notion that early Franciscans merely reiterated past ideas, emphasizing their groundbreaking contributions to philosophical discourse. The methodology employed will involve a 'practice-led' hermeneutic approach to interpret scholastic texts, considering the impact of practical experience on theoretical constructs.\n\nThe proposed project sets forth several objectives, including the production of a comprehensive study encompassing sources, methods, content, and the later reception of early Franciscan thought. It seeks to identify the novelty in Franciscan scholarship, such as the incorporation of Islamic sources, and draw connections between early and late Franciscan schools. Additionally, the project aims to highlight the shared philosophical identity between Muslim and Western traditions.\n\nThe expected outcome of this research is a nuanced scholarly analysis of how Franciscan ideas evolved into the foundations of modern Western thought when divorced from their original context. By reimagining the study of scholasticism, this project will contribute significantly to advancing knowledge in the field. Ultimately, the grant proposal seeks to shed new light on the Franciscan origins of modern Western philosophy and reshape our understanding of medieval intellectual history.",
