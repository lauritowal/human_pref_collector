        "The proposed project, titled \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders\", aims to explore the ethical implications of epigenetics on neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project will focus on key areas such as epigenetics, ethics, and neurodevelopmental disorders, and will examine influencing factors including social and physical environments. By investigating the conceptual changes in the understanding of innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, and biological/psychosocial factors, the project will utilize both theoretical and empirical investigation methods.\n\nThis research will target concepts related to capacity responsibility and normative responsibility, with a focus on professional stakeholders such as individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families. The project, known as NEUROEPIGENETHICS, will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersection between epigenetics and ethics in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ultimately aiming to inform responsible decision-making and care practices in this field.",
        "The \"Epigenetics, Experience and Responsibility: Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders\" grant proposal, under the project name NEUROEPIGENETHICS, seeks to explore the ethical implications of epigenetics on neurodevelopmental disorders, with a focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project will examine the influence of social and physical environments on the development of these disorders, as well as the interplay between innate/acquired, genetic/environmental, and biological/psychosocial factors. The investigation will employ both theoretical and empirical research methods to delve into the concepts of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility in professional stakeholders such as individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families. By studying these conditions through an epigenetic lens, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between genetics, environment, and ethics in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

The project will investigate the interplay between social and physical environments, innate and acquired factors, genetic and environmental influences, and biological and psychosocial aspects in the development of these disorders. Both theoretical and empirical investigation methods will be utilized to study concepts of capacity responsibility and normative responsibility in professional stakeholders, including individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families. Through the project \"NEUROEPIGENETHICS,\" this research aims to shed light on the complex interactions between epigenetics, experience, and responsibility in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding these conditions."
