        "The proposed project, \"Time to pay up? Reparations and global development challenges,\" seeks to study the emerging calls for reparations in global development contexts. The project, titled REPAIR, will focus on comparing reparations for various global challenges such as infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. \n\nThe main objectives of this study include comparing how reparations payments are established, implemented, and received in addressing these development challenges, as well as understanding the economic, moral, and political perspectives of these payments. Additionally, the project aims to identify the type of wealth transfer that reparations constitute and explore the \"reparative aspects\" of economic life.\n\nThis project stands out as the first comparative social-science study of reparations in the field of development. It broadens the comparative frame of reparations study and utilizes novel theory and methods from economic anthropology to investigate reparations as a form of wealth transfer. By focusing on the \"reparative aspects\" of economic activity, this study will provide valuable insights into the role of reparations in addressing global development challenges.",

The project, known as REPAIR, will conduct a comparative social-science study on reparations for various issues such as infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, minority rights violations, and toxic environments. This study aims to compare how reparations payments are established, implemented, and received in addressing global development challenges.\n\nThe objectives of the project include analyzing what reparations payments teach us about economic, moral, and political perspectives, as well as identifying the type of wealth transfer reparations constitute. By focusing on the 'reparative aspects' of economic life, this study will shed light on the role of reparations in addressing systemic injustices and promoting sustainable development.\n\nNoteworthy for being the first comparative social-science study of reparations in the field of development, REPAIR also broadens the comparative frame of reparations study. Utilizing novel theory and methods from economic anthropology, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the role of reparations as a form of wealth transfer and its implications for global development challenges. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform policy decisions and practices related to reparations and economic justice on a global scale.",

Additionally, it will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on reparations and their role in promoting economic and social justice."
