        "The proposed project, \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA), aims to examine the mechanisms for securing rights and accountability in European prisons. Through a focus on overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences, PRILA will document the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies, study the structures for fair and transparent decision-making, and assess compliance with human rights principles. By utilizing legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods, PRILA seeks to transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advance judicial review of administrative action, and enhance understanding of penal power experiences. The project will contribute to the fields of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment.\n\nThe objectives of PRILA include creating an account of accountability work experience and examining accountability structures as manifestations of penal ideologies. The project aims to advance conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, support better penal policies and practices, and protect the rule of law and rights in prisons. The distinctiveness of PRILA lies in its focus on the European experience of penal concepts, providing valuable insights that can inform policy and practice in the region. Ultimately, PRILA seeks to promote just imprisonment, uphold rights, and ensure fair treatment of prisoners in European prisons.",

        "The \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) project aims to delve into the European prison system to examine the intricate mechanisms that secure rights, ensure accountability, and uphold the rule of law. By focusing on overlooked elements of accountability and rights experiences, PRILA seeks to document the perspectives of prisoners, prison staff, and accountability bodies. Through a combination of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods, the project will study the structures for fair decision-making, appeal processes, and compliance with human rights principles within European prisons.\n\nThe significance of this project lies in its potential to transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, advance judicial review of administrative actions, and enhance our understanding of penal power dynamics. By bridging disciplines such as public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and sociology of punishment, PRILA aims to contribute to the advancement of conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness. The project's unique focus on the European experience of penal concepts sets it apart and positions it to support better penal policies and practices, protect the rule of law, and promote the rights of individuals within the prison system. Ultimately, PRILA seeks to create a comprehensive account of how accountability structures manifest penal ideologies in European prisons, with the overarching goal of promoting just imprisonment and good order."
