        "The proposed project, titled \"The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting,\" aims to investigate the neural underpinnings of parental caregiving in new parents. The study will utilize neuroimaging and psychological testing to examine brain changes associated with both normal and disrupted development of parenting.\n\nThe project consists of three subprojects: the first focuses on the normal development of parental caregiving through a longitudinal study that begins before pregnancy. This subproject will involve both women and men and will assess structural and functional brain changes along with behavioral measures on caregiving tasks. The second subproject will investigate disrupted development of parenting through a cross-sectional design, specifically looking at disruptions such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities. The third subproject aims to synthesize the findings from the first two subprojects using advanced computational models to identify fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting.\n\nOverall, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the plasticity of parental caregiving and how disruptions in this process can impact both the parent and child. The findings from this study have the potential to inform interventions and support systems for new parents experiencing challenges in their caregiving roles.",
        "The proposed project, entitled \"The plasticity of parental caregiving: characterizing the brain mechanisms underlying normal and disrupted development of parenting,\" aims to investigate the brain changes associated with the normal and disrupted development of parental caregiving in new parents. Utilizing neuroimaging and psychological testing, this study will focus on three key objectives. \n\nThe first objective involves a longitudinal study that will examine the normal development of parental caregiving, beginning before pregnancy. This subproject will involve both women and men and will utilize techniques such as structural and functional brain changes, as well as behavioral measures on caregiving tasks. \n\nThe second objective will focus on the disrupted development of parental caregiving through a cross-sectional design. This subproject will specifically examine disruptions such as parental sleep disruption and infant craniofacial abnormalities like cleft lip and palate. Techniques used will include studying the brain and behavioral effects on caregiving. \n\nThe third objective aims to synthesize findings from the previous subprojects to identify fundamental brain mechanisms and networks underlying the development of parenting. This will be achieved through the use of advanced computational models. \n\nOverall, this research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the plasticity of parental caregiving and its impact on brain development, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the complexities of parenting.",
