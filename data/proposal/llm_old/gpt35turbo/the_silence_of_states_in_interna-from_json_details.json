        "This grant proposal, titled \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" seeks to undertake the first comprehensive study of the impact of State silence in the realm of international law. The project aims to provide a detailed taxonomy of the various ways in which State silence can influence legal outcomes, with a specific focus on whether State silence can bind them, the role of State inaction in determining their responsibility, and the consequences of inaction in international dispute settlement. \n\nThe research methods for this project include an analysis of State practice in the six official UN languages, examination of international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical analysis of the reasoning behind government officials and international judges. The project will focus on the binding nature of State silence, the relationship between State inaction and responsibility, and the impact of State inaction on international dispute settlement proceedings.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including States themselves, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals involved in international legal disputes. By shedding light on this underexplored area of international law, this project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the legal implications of State silence and may inform future developments in this field.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"The Silence of States in International Law,\" aims to undertake the first comprehensive study on the implications of State silence in international law. This research will delve into whether State silence can have binding effects, the role of State inaction in determining their responsibility, and the impact of inaction in international dispute settlement processes. The project will contribute to knowledge by providing a taxonomy of the various 'silences' of States, analyzing their legal effects, and critically evaluating the need for legal reforms in this area.\n\nThe research methods employed will include an analysis of State practice in the six official UN languages, examination of international jurisprudence and literature, and empirical analysis of the reasoning behind government officials and international judges. The project will focus on the binding nature of State silence, the connection between State inaction and responsibility, and the implications of State inaction in international dispute settlement proceedings.\n\nStakeholders involved in this project include States, international courts and tribunals, domestic courts, and individuals affected by State inaction. By shedding light on this underexplored area of international law, this project seeks to deepen understanding and potentially influence the development of legal frameworks regarding State silence.",
