        "The \"NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception\" grant proposal seeks to delve into the intricate mechanisms underlying consciousness, specifically focusing on the factors that determine why certain visual stimuli are consciously perceived while others are not. This project aims to explore the intricate interplay between conscious perception, attention, and working memory, as well as investigate the neuronal processes involved in the perception of both simple and complex stimuli.\n\nBuilding upon previous research that revealed the role of frontal cortex activity in working memory storage and conscious perception of weak stimuli, this proposal aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli across various brain regions. By utilizing advanced techniques such as measuring single neuron activity in human patients with epilepsy and recording from multiple neurons in primate brains, the project seeks to create a functional connectome and identify brain regions crucial for conscious experience.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include shedding light on how sensory information transforms into conscious perception. By comparing the neural responses to different stimuli and elucidating the neural pathways involved in conscious processing, this project has the potential to deepen our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Ultimately, this grant proposal holds promise for uncovering fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing conscious perception.",
        "The \"NeUronal MEchanisms foR consciOUS perception\" grant proposal seeks to unravel the intricate neuronal processes underlying conscious perception. The project intends to investigate the reasons behind why certain visual stimuli are consciously perceived while others remain unnoticed, the interplay between conscious perception, attention, and working memory, and the neural pathways involved in processing both simple and complex stimuli that enter or evade consciousness.\n\nBuilding upon previous research demonstrating that minimal frontal cortex activity is linked to the reporting of weak stimuli, the project will delve into the functions of the visual cortex as a conduit for simple stimuli towards higher cortical regions. It will also explore the sustained interactions between the visual cortex and associative brain areas responsible for scene segmentation and visual attention during the perception of complex stimuli. By comparing the neuronal responses to simple and complex stimuli across various brain regions, the study aims to shed light on the mechanisms governing conscious perception.\n\nThe proposed methodology involves measuring single neuron activity in human patients with epilepsy, recording from multiple neurons in a monkey's hemisphere, characterizing neuronal activity in diverse cortical and subcortical regions, creating a functional connectome via perturbation methods and functional imaging in monkeys, and identifying brain regions associated with reportable conscious experiences.\n\nUltimately, this research is expected to provide valuable insights into the transformation of sensory stimuli into conscious awareness, contributing to a deeper understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of consciousness.",

By employing perturbation methods and functional imaging to construct a functional connectome, the research team will pinpoint the brain regions crucial for generating conscious experiences. Ultimately, the study aims to provide valuable insights into how sensory stimuli translate into conscious perception, advancing our understanding of the neural basis of consciousness. This project has the potential to revolutionize our knowledge of consciousness and pave the way for future breakthroughs in cognitive neuroscience."
