        "The proposed project, titled \"HISTORICAL ROOTS OF CONFLICT AND DEVELOPMENT: FROM PREHISTORY TO THE COLONIZATION EXPERIENCE\", seeks to investigate the impact of historical roots on conflict and economic development. The research will be conducted in two parts. The first part will focus on the effect of history on conflict and economic development within Latin America, using administrative data on the first colonizers of the region from 1492-1599. This part will explore the relationship between institutions, human capital, economic development, and conflict, with a specific emphasis on the initial times of colonization. The second part of the project will examine the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict dynamics. This will involve constructing a dataset with the location of ancient conflicts using archaeological evidence, allowing for a long-term analysis of conflict patterns.\n\nOverall, this research proposal aims to provide insights into the long-term impacts of historical factors on conflict and economic development. By combining data on early Latin American settlers and archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the roots of conflict in the region. The findings from this study have the potential to inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting peace and sustainable development in Latin America and beyond.",
        "The proposed project, \"Historical Roots of Conflict and Development: From Prehistory to the Colonization Experience,\" seeks to investigate the impact of history on conflict and economic development. The research will be conducted in two parts. \n\nPart 1 will focus on examining the effect of history on conflict and economic development by utilizing administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The dataset will include information on the town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, and city of arrival in the Americas from 1492-1599. The analysis will be within-country and will explore topics such as institutions versus human capital, economic development, and conflict. The study will also investigate institutional variation during the initial times of colonization and analyze the interaction between human capital and institutions.\n\nPart 2 will investigate the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict by constructing a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence. The analysis will focus on long-run dynamics of conflict in various regions.\n\nOverall, this research proposal aims to provide valuable insights into the role of historical factors in shaping conflict and economic development. By combining data on early Latin American settlers and archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts, the project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the historical roots of contemporary challenges in these areas.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"HISTORICAL ROOTS OF CONFLICT AND DEVELOPMENT: FROM PREHISTORY TO THE COLONIZATION EXPERIENCE,\" seeks to investigate the impact of historical roots on conflict and economic development. The research consists of two main parts: the first part focuses on the effect of history on conflict and economic development in Latin America by utilizing administrative data on the first colonizers from Spain in the period of 1492-1599. This part will analyze the relationship between institutions, human capital, economic development, and conflict, particularly during the initial times of colonization. The second part of the project aims to explore the influence of very old conflicts on current conflict dynamics by constructing a dataset based on archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts across different regions.\n\nBy combining data on early Latin American settlers and archaeological evidence of ancient conflicts, this research project will provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of historical factors on conflict and economic development. The findings from this study will contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between historical roots, institutions, human capital, and conflict dynamics, ultimately informing policy interventions aimed at promoting peace and sustainable development in Latin America and beyond."
