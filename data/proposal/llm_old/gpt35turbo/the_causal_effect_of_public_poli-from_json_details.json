        "The proposed project, \"The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital,\" aims to investigate the impact of public policies and income on child development in Spain over the past 35 years. Grounded in the fetal origins hypothesis, the study will focus on the \"missing middle\" period of child development, from ages 0-15. Using a large sample size and state-of-the-art econometric techniques, the research will analyze the effects of interventions and shocks related to household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, family planning services, and aggregate demand on outcomes such as hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores.\n\nBy examining potential channels such as family size, parental time use, labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms through which public policies and income influence child health and human capital. The study has significant policy implications, as it will inform decision-makers about the most effective strategies for promoting child development in Spain. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the broader understanding of how public policies can shape the future well-being of children and enhance human capital in society.",
        "The proposed project, \"The Causal Effect of Public Policy and Income on Child Health and Human Capital,\" aims to investigate the impact of public policies and income on child development in Spain. Utilizing the fetal origins hypothesis as a theoretical framework, the study will focus on the \"missing middle\" period in child development, spanning from birth to age 15. By analyzing a large sample of hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores over a 35-year period, the research will employ state-of-the-art econometric techniques to assess the causal relationships between various interventions and shocks, such as household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks.\n\nThe study will explore potential channels through which these interventions impact child development, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. By providing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different public policies on child health and human capital, the research aims to inform future policy decisions and interventions aimed at improving outcomes for children in Spain. The findings of this study will have significant policy implications, potentially shaping the design and implementation of future public policies related to child development and well-being.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the causal effect of public policy and income on child health and human capital, focusing on the fetal origins hypothesis and the \"missing middle\" period in Spain. The study will utilize a large sample size and state-of-the-art econometric techniques to analyze the impact of interventions and shocks such as household material resources, parental time, medical treatments around birth, availability of family planning services, and aggregate demand shocks on children aged 0-15. Outcome measures will include hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores. The potential channels through which these policies and shocks may affect child development include family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, and expenditure patterns. By examining administrative data spanning 35 years, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of public policies on child well-being. The findings from this study have the potential to inform future policy decisions and interventions aimed at improving the health and human capital of children in Spain."
