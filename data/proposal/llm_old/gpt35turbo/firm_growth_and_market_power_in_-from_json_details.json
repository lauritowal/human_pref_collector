        "The proposed project, \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy,\" aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power to offer valuable insights into welfare and policy in a globalized context. The research objective is to delve into how trade and industrial policies impact growth, especially in less developed markets, by incorporating richer firm behavior in models of international trade. The project will address key research questions such as ensuring consumer benefits from globalization when firms possess market power, the impact of domestic policies on small farmers in the agribusiness sector, the influence of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages, and the effect of banking globalization on real sector firm growth. Through a five-year duration focusing on developing economies and integrating theoretical work with rich data, the project aims to expand the knowledge frontier on trade and industrial policy and provide a solid foundation for informed policymaking. \"BIGlobal\" will be at the forefront of examining firm growth and market power, offering new perspectives on welfare and policy in today's interconnected global economy.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy,\" aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power to offer valuable insights into welfare and policy in a globalized world. The research will focus on incorporating richer firm behavior in models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact growth, particularly in less developed markets. \n\nThe project will address key research questions such as how trade and competition policy can ensure consumer benefits from globalization when firms with market power are engaged in international trade, the impact of domestic policies on small farmers in the context of agribusiness firms, and how industrial policies influence firm growth through input linkages. Additionally, the study will explore the effects of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector.\n\nThrough a duration of five years and a focus on developing economies, the project will integrate theoretical work with rich data to expand the frontier of knowledge on trade and industrial policy. The expected outcomes include providing a basis for informed policymaking and contributing to a deeper understanding of how firms' growth and market power shape the global economy. \"BIGlobal\" aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of firm growth and market power in the global economy, ultimately informing effective policy decisions for a more equitable and sustainable global market.",
        "The proposed project, \"Firm Growth and Market Power in the Global Economy,\" aims to analyze the sources of firm growth and market power to offer valuable insights into welfare and policy considerations in today's globalized world. Building on the motivations outlined in EC 2007, the research will focus on incorporating richer firm behavior into models of international trade to understand how trade and industrial policies impact growth, particularly in less developed markets. \n\nThe project will address key research questions such as how trade and competition policies can ensure that consumers benefit from globalization despite firms' market power, the effects of domestic policies on small farmers in agribusiness, and the impact of industrial policies on firm growth through input linkages. Additionally, the study will explore the influence of banking globalization on the growth of firms in the real sector.\n\nOver a five-year period, the research will concentrate on developing economies and integrate theoretical work with rich data to provide a comprehensive analysis. The expected outcomes of the project include expanding the frontiers of knowledge on trade and industrial policy and offering a basis for informed policymaking. Through these efforts, BIGlobal seeks to contribute novel perspectives on firm growth and market power, ultimately informing policy decisions in the global economy."
