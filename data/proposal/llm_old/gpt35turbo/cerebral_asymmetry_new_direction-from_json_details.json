        "The proposed project, \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to explore functional cerebral asymmetry through the study of impaired language development by combining genetic and neuropsychological approaches. This project will build upon the Network efficiency hypothesis, focusing on identifying individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralization. By utilizing methods such as behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, the project aims to investigate the increased risk for language and literacy impairment if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres.\n\nFurthermore, the project will utilize simulations from genetic models to explore twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization. By employing a Double hit genetic model and focusing on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome, the project aims to uncover how neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise with more than one hit on a functional brain circuit. Additionally, the project will investigate individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality by searching for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements that may lead to a departure from consistent left hemisphere language. Overall, this project will provide new insights into the correlates and etiology of cerebral asymmetry, with potential implications for understanding language development and impairment.",
        "The proposed project, \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to advance our understanding of functional cerebral asymmetry through a multidisciplinary approach. The project will focus on impaired language development and employ genetic and neuropsychological methodologies to explore the underlying mechanisms. The key hypothesis guiding this research is the Network efficiency hypothesis.\n\nThe project consists of several interconnected research projects. Project A will utilize behavioural measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralisation. Project B predicts an increased risk for language and literacy impairment if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres. Project C will use simulations from genetic models and twin-cotwin similarity data to investigate language lateralisation. Project D will explore a Double hit genetic model and its prediction that neurodevelopmental abnormalities arise with multiple hits on functional brain circuits, focusing on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin due to an extra sex chromosome. Lastly, Project E will study individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality, searching for rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with a departure from consistent left hemisphere language.\n\nThis innovative and comprehensive project has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of cerebral asymmetry and its implications for language development.",
        "The proposed project, \"CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CORRELATES AND ETIOLOGY,\" aims to explore functional cerebral asymmetry through the study of impaired language development by integrating genetic and neuropsychological approaches. With 150 years since Broca's landmark work, this project seeks to investigate the Network Efficiency Hypothesis, focusing on identifying individual differences in patterns of dissociation between language functions in lateralization. The project will utilize a variety of methods, including behavioral measures, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to achieve this objective.\n\nMoreover, the project will examine the potential increased risk for language and literacy impairment if different language functions are represented in opposite hemispheres. By employing simulations from genetic models and analyzing twin-cotwin similarity in language lateralization, the study aims to elucidate the role of a double hit genetic model in the development of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Specifically, the project will focus on individuals with an extra dose of neuroligin caused by an extra sex chromosome to investigate this phenomenon.\n\nOverall, this project will provide new insights into the correlates and etiology of cerebral asymmetry, particularly in individuals with inconsistent patterns of language laterality. By exploring rare genetic mutations and structural rearrangements associated with a departure from consistent left hemisphere language, this research has the potential to advance our understanding of language development and disorders."
