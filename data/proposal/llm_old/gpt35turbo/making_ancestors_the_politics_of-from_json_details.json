        "The grant proposal \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\" aims to challenge traditional views on politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe by offering a new perspective that situational inequality manifested rather than overtly. The project will empirically test this theory using methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy in the test sequence region of Peninsular Italy. Focusing on key periods from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, the project plans to analyze 200 individuals per period to evaluate how inequality affected lives and understand the role of ancestors in shaping social dynamics.\n\nBy examining burial practices and skeletal remains, the research aims to provide insights into the political structures and power dynamics of ancient European societies. The project's innovative approach of studying inequality through the lens of deathways offers a unique opportunity to challenge existing narratives and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of prehistoric social structures. This grant proposal seeks funding to support the empirical testing and analysis required to achieve these research goals and advance knowledge in the field of archaeology.",
        "The proposed project, \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe,\" seeks to challenge traditional views on politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe by offering a new perspective that emphasizes situational manifestations of inequality. Through empirical testing utilizing methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, the project will focus on the test sequence region of Peninsular Italy across key periods including the Neolithic, Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age. By analyzing 200 individuals per period, the research aims to evaluate how inequality affected lives and understand the role of ancestors in shaping societal structures. The project's overarching goal is to test alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of power and social organization in ancient societies. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly contribute to the field of archaeology, offering new insights into the complex interplay between politics, inequality, and death practices in prehistoric Europe.",
        "The grant proposal \"Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe\" seeks to challenge traditional views on politics and inequality in prehistoric Europe by offering a new perspective that suggests inequality manifested situationally rather than overtly. Through empirical testing using methodologies such as osteobiography and funerary taphonomy, the project aims to analyze 200 individuals per key period (Neolithic, Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age) in Peninsular Italy (6000-600 BC). The research goals include evaluating how inequality affected lives and understanding the role of ancestors in shaping societal structures. By testing alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the social dynamics of early European societies. This grant proposal has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of political structures and social hierarchies in prehistoric Europe, shedding light on the complexities of ancient societies and their treatment of the deceased."
