        "The proposed project, \"Collaborative AI Counters Hate,\" aims to tackle the challenges of AI-assisted extreme speech moderation through a collaborative bottom-up coding approach. The project addresses key issues such as the quality, scope, and inclusivity of training data sets, as well as the lack of procedural guidelines and cultural contextualization. By implementing a global comparative framework in AI-assisted solutions and utilizing a community-based classification approach, the project seeks to improve AI-assisted speech moderation.\n\nThrough collaboration between fact-checkers, AI developers, and academic intermediaries, the project will develop an open access toolkit, set procedural benchmarks, operationalize 'the human in the loop' principle, and create inclusive training datasets. The project model, AI4Dignity, emphasizes the importance of promoting dignity and respect in online interactions.\n\nUltimately, the project aims to address issues related to online hate speech and disinformation by leveraging the power of collaborative AI solutions. By fostering collaboration and innovation in this space, the project seeks to make a meaningful impact in countering hate speech and promoting a more inclusive and respectful online environment.",
