    "title": "The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine",
    "descriptions": [
        "The Upcycled Clinic is a groundbreaking global ethnography project that aims to address the issue of wastefulness in medicine by exploring creative material engagement in contemporary healthcare settings. This project will consist of five sub-projects located in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S, and the U.K, involving a diverse group of participants including ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff. Through the use of fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets, the project seeks to understand the conditions that facilitate innovation and improvisation in the clinic.\n\nBy moving beyond the traditional focus on patient encounters, this project will contribute to the development of new methods for reusing and sharing research material, while also advancing theories of materiality and addressing questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. The practical outcomes of this research will include articulating the conditions for healthcare creativity and identifying local solutions to wastefulness and shortage in medical settings.\n\nOverall, The Upcycled Clinic represents a unique opportunity to explore the potential for repurposing in the clinic and to develop a globally oriented understanding of improvisation in healthcare. This project has the potential to make a significant impact on healthcare practices and contribute to the broader field of medical anthropology.",
        "The Upcycled Clinic is a groundbreaking global ethnographic project focused on addressing the issue of wastefulness in contemporary medicine. This project aims to explore the conditions for creative material engagement in clinics through a multi-faceted approach that includes fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets. The project consists of five sub-projects taking place in diverse locations such as Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S, and the U.K, involving participants ranging from ethnographers to cleaners and laundry staff.\n\nBy moving beyond the traditional patient encounter focus, this project seeks to be the first globally orientated study of improvisation in the clinic, ultimately developing new methods for reusing and sharing research material. The implications of this research are vast, as it has the potential to advance theories of materiality, address questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace, and articulate conditions for healthcare creativity and local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.\n\nThis project not only has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of medical anthropology but also to drive real-world change by identifying practical outcomes that can inform policy and practice in healthcare settings worldwide.",
        "The Upcycled Clinic: A global ethnography of material creativity in contemporary medicine is a groundbreaking project that seeks to address the issue of wastefulness in medicine through innovative approaches. The proposal focuses on conducting an ethnographic study that examines the practice of repurposing materials in clinics around the world.\n\nThe project consists of five sub-projects located in Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S, and the U.K, involving participants such as ethnographers, cleaners, and laundry staff. By utilizing research methods such as fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of open datasets, the objective is to understand the conditions that foster creative material engagement in healthcare settings.\n\nThis initiative will contribute to the advancement of hospital ethnographies by shifting the focus beyond patient encounters to include the broader context of material creativity. It will be the first globally-oriented study of improvisation in the clinic, aiming to develop new methods for reusing and sharing research material.\n\nThe implications of this project are far-reaching, as it has the potential to advance theories of materiality and address questions of resilience and innovation in the workplace. Ultimately, the practical outcomes will articulate the conditions for healthcare creativity and promote local solutions to wastefulness and shortage in the medical field."
