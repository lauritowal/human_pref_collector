    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, \"Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector,\" aims to address the pressing issue of education reform on a global scale. With a focus on school autonomy and accountability, the project will examine the adoption and impact of these policies in a variety of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development. By partnering with international organizations like the OECD, the project seeks to promote these policies on a global scale.\n\nThe research will address key questions surrounding the dissemination and convergence of SAWA policies, as well as their effects on learning outcomes and equity. By filling in research gaps and utilizing a comprehensive research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, the project aims to provide robust and multi-scalar analysis. This will involve studying the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes at play, involving international bureaucrats and teachers as key actors.\n\nOverall, the project, named REFORMED, will contribute valuable insights into the contextual and institutional circumstances of SAWA policies, ultimately aiming to improve education systems globally.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Reforming Schools Globally: A Multi-Scalar Analysis of Autonomy and Accountability Policies in the Education Sector\" seeks to address the pressing need for a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the adoption of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAWA) policies worldwide. The project, named REFORMED, will employ a comprehensive research approach to examine the dissemination, convergence, contextual circumstances, and effects of SAWA policies on learning outcomes and equity. By focusing on the interaction between global reform pressures, different administrative traditions, and levels of development in a range of countries, the project aims to fill critical research gaps and provide insights into the complex dynamics shaping education policy at both the international and local levels.\n\nUtilizing a multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, REFORMED will investigate the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes involved in the implementation of SAWA policies, engaging with a diverse set of actors including international bureaucrats and teachers. The project will analyze the effects of these policies at the school level, examining their robustness and implications for educational outcomes. By exploring the inception, operationalization, and effects of SAWA policies in multiple contexts, REFORMED seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of autonomy and accountability in shaping educational practices and outcomes on a global scale.",
