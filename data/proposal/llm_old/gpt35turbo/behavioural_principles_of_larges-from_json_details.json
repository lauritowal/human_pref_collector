        "The proposed project, entitled \"PRINCIPLES: Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation,\" aims to address pressing global issues such as global warming and Covid-19 by investigating the behavioural principles underlying large-scale cooperation. Current models of cooperation often focus on narrow aspects, limiting their effectiveness in addressing complex societal challenges. This project seeks to develop a comprehensive model that integrates insights from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology to create a unified science of human cooperation.\n\nThe key concept of the project is \"rule following,\" which will be used to experimentally test behavioural principles of cooperation and analyze models of social dilemmas. By combining different social sciences' insights and methods, the project will conduct incentivized experiments in representative samples to investigate the behavioural links between these principles. The ultimate goal is to explain behavior in large-scale cooperation problems and equip researchers and policymakers with the tools and data needed to study and address cooperation challenges effectively.\n\n\"PRINCIPLES\" targets researchers and policymakers interested in climate care and other global cooperation issues, offering a novel, interdisciplinary, and experimentally tested framework for understanding and promoting large-scale cooperation.",
        "The \"Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation\" grant proposal, known as PRINCIPLES, aims to address pressing global issues such as global warming and pandemics like Covid-19 by studying and understanding the behavioural underpinnings of large-scale cooperation. The current models in place are limited as they focus on narrow aspects of cooperation, overlooking the interdisciplinary nature of the problem. \n\nPRINCIPLES seeks to develop a unified science of human cooperation by integrating insights and methods from fields such as Economics, Sociology, and Moral and Social Psychology. The key concept of \"Rule following\" will be central to the project, which aims to develop a comprehensive model, experimentally test behavioural principles of cooperation, investigate behavioural links between principles, analyse models of social dilemmas, and explain behaviour in large-scale cooperation problems.\n\nThe project will employ novel experimentally tested frameworks and incentivised experiments in representative samples to gather data and insights. By equipping researchers and policy makers with the necessary tools and data, PRINCIPLES seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of cooperation, enabling more effective strategies for tackling issues like climate care. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a more sustainable and cooperative global society.",
        "The project \"Behavioural Principles of Large-Scale Cooperation\" aims to address pressing global issues such as global warming and pandemics like Covid19 by understanding the key principles that drive cooperation on a large scale. The current models in this field are limited in scope and often focus on narrow aspects, hindering a comprehensive understanding of human behavior in collective interest scenarios. \n\nThis project proposes an integrated research approach that combines insights and methods from diverse fields such as Economics, Sociology, and Moral and Social Psychology to develop a unified science of human cooperation. By focusing on the key concept of rule following, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive model, experimentally test behavioral principles, investigate links between these principles, analyze models of social dilemmas, and explain behavior in large-scale cooperation problems.\n\nThe project, named PRINCIPLES, will conduct incentivized experiments in representative samples to gather data and test the framework. The ultimate goal is to provide researchers and policy makers with the necessary tools and insights to study and address issues related to cooperation, with a specific focus on climate care. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and experimental testing, PRINCIPLES aims to advance our understanding of human behavior in large-scale cooperation scenarios and contribute to the development of effective solutions for global challenges."
