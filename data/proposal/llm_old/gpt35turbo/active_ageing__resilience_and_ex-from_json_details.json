        "The proposed project, \"ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME,\" aims to address the critical issue of active ageing among older adults. The project's goals include the development of a comprehensive scale for assessing active ageing, examining determinants and modifiers of active ageing, creating a sustainable intervention to promote active ageing, testing the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention, and studying cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing.\n\nUtilizing methods such as counselling, information technology, and help from volunteers, the project will be grounded in the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing. Data will be collected from a cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85, and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be employed for analysis. The project will also compare current data with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago and conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 200.\n\nThe proposed project aims to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and produce evidence for active ageing promotion. The anticipated benefits include the development of a novel scale for active ageing, training opportunities for young scientists, and the advancement of new concepts and theories in the field. This project has the potential to make a significant impact on the well-being and quality of life of older adults by promoting active ageing and resilience through external support.",
        "The \"ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\" project aims to address the pressing issue of active ageing and its impact on disablement outcomes. The proposed project will focus on developing a comprehensive scale for assessing active ageing, with dimensions including ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy, based on the WHO definition of active ageing. By examining determinants and modifiers of active ageing, the project seeks to create novel knowledge on the preconditions for active ageing and produce evidence for its promotion.\n\nThe project will utilize a variety of methods such as counselling, information technology, and help from volunteers to develop a multicomponent sustainable intervention to promote active ageing. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 200 will be conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention. Data will be collected from a cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85, and compared with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago to study cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. State-of-the-art statistical methods will be employed to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nThe proposed project will not only lead to the development of a novel scale for active ageing but also provide training opportunities for young scientists and contribute to the development of new concepts and theories in the field. Overall, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the understanding and promotion of active ageing.",
        "The \"ACTIVE AGEING – RESILIENCE AND EXTERNAL SUPPORT AS MODIFIERS OF THE DISABLEMENT OUTCOME\" grant proposal aims to address the pressing need for understanding and promoting active ageing among older adults. The project will focus on developing a comprehensive scale for assessing active ageing, encompassing dimensions such as ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy, based on the WHO definition of active ageing. By examining determinants and modifiers of active ageing, the study seeks to create novel knowledge on the preconditions necessary for successful ageing.\n\nUtilizing state-of-the-art statistical methods, the project will collect data from a cross-sectional sample of 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85. By comparing this data with pre-existing cohort data from 25 years ago, the study will investigate cohort effects on the pathway to active ageing. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 200 will be conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a multicomponent sustainable intervention designed to promote active ageing.\n\nThe proposed methods include counseling, information technology, and help from volunteers to support older adults in their journey towards active ageing. The project aims to produce evidence that can inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting active ageing and enhancing the well-being of older adults. The benefits of the study include the development of a novel scale for active ageing, training opportunities for young scientists, and the advancement of new concepts and theories in the field of gerontology."
