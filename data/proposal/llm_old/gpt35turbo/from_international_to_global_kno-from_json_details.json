        "The proposed project, \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health,\" aims to conduct a socio-historical study of the transition between two regimes of knowledge and action in post-World War II health governance. Focused on areas such as Tuberculosis, Mental health, Traditional medicine, and Medical genetics, the project will utilize historical and anthropological investigation types to explore the changing roles of the World Health Organization and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India. By examining the emergence of the current regime in the 1980s, the project seeks to uncover the transition from Cold War political and economic order to a neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty. \n\nExpected benefits of the project include the inclusion of various social worlds such as laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. By approaching global health as translated in and emerging from local practices and knowledge, the project will provide insights into different levels of circulation beyond traditional North-South transfers. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities and dynamics of global health governance in the modern era.",
        "The proposed project, \"From International to Global: Knowledge, Diseases and the Postwar Government of Health,\" aims to conduct a socio-historical study of the transition between two regimes of knowledge and action in post-World War II health governance. Focused on key areas such as Tuberculosis, Mental health, Traditional medicine, and Medical genetics, the project will utilize historical and anthropological investigation types to explore the changing roles of the World Health Organization and developments in non-Western countries, particularly India.\n\nThe project's expected benefits include the inclusion of various social worlds like laboratories, hospitals, enterprises, public health institutions, and international organizations. By approaching global health as a phenomenon that emerges from local practices and knowledge, the project seeks to understand the transition from the Cold War era to the current neo-liberal and multi-centric age of uncertainty. Through an analysis of the shift from international public health to global health, characterized by risk management, chronic diseases, market-driven regulations, and private-public alliances, the project aims to shed light on different levels of circulation beyond traditional North-South transfers. Ultimately, this research will contribute valuable insights into the evolution of health governance and its implications on a global scale.",
