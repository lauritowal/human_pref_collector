        "The \"Students’ understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship education\" grant proposal, known as STUDACT, aims to investigate how students engage with Global Citizenship Education (GCE) based on personal traits or context. The project will focus on transforming education systems, empowering learners, building peaceful societies, fostering mutual understanding, and addressing challenges in developing GCE. \n\nThe research will take place in countries such as Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK, using methodologies such as group discussions, Photovoice activism, and social media analysis. The analysis will examine policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance. \n\nThe project seeks to address the lack of systematic baseline data on student understanding and appropriation of GCE, and aims to answer research questions such as how students of different backgrounds understand GCE, how they appropriate it, and how understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, student characteristics, and education systems. \n\nSTUDACT will treat students as core partners and agentic participants in the exploration and contextualization of GCE, with the ultimate goal of enhancing global citizenship education and promoting peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and secure societies by 2030.",
        "The proposal \"Students’ understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship education\" aims to address the challenges in developing Global Citizenship Education (GCE) by focusing on transforming education systems, empowering learners, building peaceful societies, and fostering mutual understanding. The project, named STUDACT, hypothesizes that students engage with GCE based on personal traits or context. \n\nThe research will be conducted in countries such as Russia, US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and UK using methodologies like group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. The analysis will focus on policies and curricula on GCE at various levels of governance. \n\nThe project seeks to answer research questions such as how students of different backgrounds understand and appropriate GCE, how understandings differ within and between countries, and how student attitudes align with international organizations and teacher training programs. \n\nThrough STUDACT, students will be treated as core partners and agentic participants in the exploration and contextualization of their reception of GCE. This project aims to provide a systematic baseline on student understanding and appropriation of GCE, ultimately contributing to the broader goal of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Quality Education by 2030.",
        "The proposed project, \"Students’ understanding and appropriation of Global Citizenship education\" (STUDACT), aims to investigate how students engage with Global Citizenship Education (GCE) based on personal traits or context. With a focus on transforming education systems, empowering learners, building peaceful societies, fostering mutual understanding, and addressing challenges in developing GCE, STUDACT seeks to fill the gap of a systematic baseline on student understanding and appropriation of GCE.\n\nThrough a multi-country study in Russia, the US, Italy, Australia, Germany, and the UK, the project will utilize various data collection methods such as group discussions, photovoice activism, and social media analysis. The analysis will focus on policies and curricula related to GCE at different levels of governance.\n\nBy addressing research questions on how students of different backgrounds understand and appropriate GCE, how understandings differ within and between countries, curricula, contexts, and education systems, and how student attitudes align with international organizations and teacher training programs, STUDACT seeks to provide insights that can inform educational policies and practices. Ultimately, the project aims to treat students as core partners and agentic participants in the process of GCE, contributing to the broader goal of creating inclusive and tolerant societies by 2030."
