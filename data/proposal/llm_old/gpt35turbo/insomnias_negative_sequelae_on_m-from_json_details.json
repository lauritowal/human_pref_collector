        "The proposed project, entitled \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged\", aims to address the significant impact of insomnia on mood in the elderly population. With major depression prevalence at 1-3% and clinically significant depression symptoms at 8-16%, the detection rate is currently less than 20% with only moderate treatment effectiveness. The project's priority action is preventive intervention, targeting insomnia as a key risk factor with a prevalence of up to 40% in the elderly population and a 13% risk of progression to depression.\n\nThe project goals include early identification of at-risk individuals, quantification of underlying mechanisms, and enrollment in intervention protocols. The approach involves multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging, with an interdisciplinary strategy to achieve outcomes such as subtype and mechanism profiling, as well as intervention optimization. The intervention format will be internet-supported and home-applicable, focusing on sleep improvement and depression prevention.\n\nBy bridging neuroscience research with practical intervention strategies, this project has the potential to significantly improve the mental health outcomes of the elderly population by addressing the negative sequelae of insomnia on mood.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged\", aims to address the detrimental impact of insomnia on mood in the elderly population. With major depression affecting 1-3% and clinically significant depression symptoms prevalent in 8-16% of the elderly population, the detection rate remains below 20% with moderate treatment effectiveness. By focusing on preventive intervention, the project targets insomnia as a key risk factor, with prevalence in the elderly population reaching up to 40% and a 13% risk of developing depression.\n\nThe project goals include early identification of at-risk individuals, quantifying the mechanisms linking insomnia to depression, and enrolling individuals in intervention protocols. Through a combination of multivariate trait analysis, brain imaging, and an interdisciplinary strategy, the project aims to profile subtypes, mechanisms, and optimize interventions. The intervention format will be internet-supported and home-applicable, focusing on sleep improvement and depression prevention.\n\nOverall, this project seeks to bridge the gap in detecting and treating mood disorders in the elderly population by targeting insomnia as a preventative measure. By understanding the underlying mechanisms and optimizing interventions, the project aims to improve the overall mental well-being of the elderly population.",
        "The proposed project, \"Insomnia’s Negative Sequelae On Mood: from Neuroscience to Intervention in the Aged,\" aims to address the impact of insomnia on mood, specifically targeting the elderly population. With major depression affecting 1-3% and clinically significant depression symptoms affecting 8-16% of the elderly, the detection rate of at-risk individuals is currently less than 20%. This project will focus on preventive intervention, with insomnia being identified as a key risk factor, as it has a prevalence of up to 40% in the elderly and is associated with a 13% risk of developing depression.\n\nThe project goals include early identification of at-risk individuals, quantification of underlying mechanisms, and enrollment in intervention protocols. The approach involves multivariate trait analysis and brain imaging to identify subtypes and mechanisms, with an interdisciplinary strategy in place. The outcomes will include subtype and mechanism profiling, as well as optimization of intervention strategies. The intervention format will be internet-supported and home-applicable, focusing on improving sleep and preventing depression.\n\nBy focusing on sleep improvement and depression prevention in the elderly population, this project has the potential to make significant advancements in understanding and addressing the negative sequelae of insomnia on mood."
