    "title": "Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire: A bio-archaeological project on resilience and collapse in early Christian development of the Negev Desert",
    "descriptions": [
        "The proposed project, titled \"Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire,\" aims to investigate the resilience and collapse of early Christian development in the Negev Desert during the 4th-7th century AD. By employing an innovative and integrative approach, the project seeks to understand the sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments. Through the exploration of social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the question of plague, the research will focus on Byzantine early Christian urban centers in the Negev Desert.\n\nUtilizing a range of research methods including archaeology, biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, and geological analysis, the project will analyze households, landscapes, garbage, artifacts, and contextual data to uncover new insights into the challenges faced by ancient societies. The relevance of this research lies in addressing societal vulnerability in marginal regions, with implications for global development.\n\nWhile the project faces risks related to the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, the benefits include a critical re-evaluation of current knowledge and the generation of more nuanced generalizations about human ingenuity in sustainable development. Ultimately, this bio-archaeological project has the potential to shed light on the dynamics of collapse and resilience in ancient societies, offering valuable lessons for contemporary challenges.",
        "The proposed project, \"Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire,\" aims to investigate the resilience and collapse of early Christian development in the Negev Desert during the 4th-7th century AD. Utilizing an integrative and data-intensive approach, the project will focus on understanding the long-term sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments. By exploring contexts of collapse and resilience in Byzantine early Christian urban centers, the research will address key questions related to social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the impact of potential plague outbreaks.\n\nThrough a combination of archaeological, biomolecular, botanical, zoological, and geological analyses, as well as chronometric techniques and contextual data analysis, the project seeks to provide a critical re-evaluation of current knowledge and offer more nuanced insights into the limits of human ingenuity in sustainable development. The relevance of this research lies in its potential to inform our understanding of societal vulnerability in marginal regions, particularly in a world where such issues are increasingly expanding to global levels.\n\nWhile the project faces risks associated with the underdetermined nature of historical and proxy data, the benefits include the generation of new data that could lead to groundbreaking discoveries and reshape our understanding of ancient societies. Overall, this project holds significant promise for shedding light on the dynamics of resilience and collapse in early Christian communities on the margins of the Byzantine Empire.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a bio-archaeological project titled \"Crisis on the margins of the Byzantine Empire\" focusing on the resilience and collapse of early Christian development in the Negev Desert during the 4th-7th century AD. The project aims to explore the contexts of collapse and resilience in a society with socio-political complexity and technological ingenuity, addressing research questions on social disintegration, economic stress, environmental degradation, and the question of plague. Using innovative methods such as biomolecular analysis, botanical and zoological studies, and artifact analysis, the project aims to shed light on the long-term sustainable functioning of complex societies in resource-limited environments.\n\nThe relevance of this project lies in its potential to contribute to understanding societal vulnerability in marginal regions, offering insights that can be applied to global development challenges. While the project faces risks due to the underdetermined nature of historical data, the benefits include a critical re-evaluation of current knowledge and more nuanced generalizations regarding human ingenuity in sustainable development. By conducting detailed archaeological investigations and data-intensive analyses, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to the resilience and collapse of ancient societies, ultimately informing contemporary discussions on sustainable development."
