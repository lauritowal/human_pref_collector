        "The project \"Revealing Earliest Animal Domestication in the Fertile Crescent\" aims to contribute to the understanding of Neolithic archaeological research on animal domestication, with a specific focus on early evidences of sheep and goat management. Through the use of biogeochemical analyses on fossil teeth, the project will investigate key mechanisms such as the control of animals' reproductive cycles, changes to animals' feeding habits, and interruption of migratory-seasonal movements. The study will be conducted in key regions including the Southern Levant, Northern Levant, and Eastern Fertile Crescent, targeting faunal assemblages, wild relatives in museum collections, and current living populations in breeding centers.\n\nThe project's goals are to unravel paradigms on the origin of animal domesticates, identify how human societies changed the animals, discover early caprine management practices, and establish when and where animal domestication processes began. By shedding light on these aspects, the research will contribute to the broader understanding of early human-animal interactions and the development of human societies. The findings from this project have the potential to significantly impact our knowledge of the earliest stages of animal domestication in the Fertile Crescent region.",
