        "The proposed project, \"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought,\" seeks to conduct an interdisciplinary and comparative study of early contributions to formalism in the field of Philosophy of Science and Logic during the first half of the twentieth century. The project will consist of three subprojects: a historical reconstruction focusing on the period of 1860-1910 and key figures such as Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp; a comparative study analyzing the period of 1920-1940 and key figures including David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick; and an analysis of philosophical implications, exploring topics such as semantics in logic and philosophy, philosophy of model theory, inferentialism, and the logical study of scientific theories.\n\nThis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of formalism in the specified time frame, shedding light on its historical context, key figures, and philosophical implications. By examining the connections between different intellectual currents and the evolution of formal methods in logic and philosophy, this study will contribute to the broader understanding of the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century. The results of this project will be disseminated through scholarly publications, conferences, and workshops, enriching the academic discourse in the field of Philosophy of Science and Logic.",
        "The grant proposal, \"The Formal Turn - The Emergence of Formalism in Twentieth-Century Thought,\" seeks to explore the development of formalism in the fields of Philosophy of Science and Logic during the first half of the twentieth century. The objective of this project is to conduct an interdisciplinary and comparative study of the early contributions to formalism, focusing on key figures and pivotal periods.\n\nThe project consists of three main subprojects. The first subproject involves a historical reconstruction of the period between 1860-1910, exploring the intersection of Nineteenth-century mathematics and Neo-Kantian epistemology through the works of Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Paul Natorp. The second subproject is a comparative study of the formal turn in logic and Logical empiricism from 1920-1940, analyzing the contributions of David Hilbert, Paul Bernays, Gerhard Gentzen, Rudolf Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The third subproject focuses on the analysis of philosophical implications, delving into topics such as Semantics in logic and philosophy, Philosophy of model theory, Inferentialism, and the Logical study of scientific theories.\n\nThis grant proposal aims to shed light on the evolution of formalism in twentieth-century thought, providing valuable insights into the philosophical and logical foundations of modern science and epistemology. By examining the works of key figures and tracing the development of formalism, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intellectual movements that shaped our contemporary understanding of logic and scientific reasoning.",

This grant proposal is essential for advancing our understanding of the origins and implications of formalism in modern philosophy and science."
