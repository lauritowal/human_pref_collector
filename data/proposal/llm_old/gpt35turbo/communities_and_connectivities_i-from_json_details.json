        "The project \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours\" proposes to conduct the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations in Europe, focusing on the period from 800 BC to AD 100. The research will primarily explore the region of Britain within the wider European context, utilizing methodologies such as ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological approaches. \n\nThe project aims to map genetic clusters, address population movement, explore inter-regional connectivity, examine social dynamics, investigate household compositions, identify familial relationships, analyze gender-specific mobility, and study the development of social inequalities. The scale of analysis will involve studying 1000 individuals in the UK and 250 individuals in Europe.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include providing a new vision of Iron Age communities and serving as a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond. The interdisciplinary team brings together expertise in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology to ensure the success of the project.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of Iron Age populations and their interactions, shedding light on the complexities of ancient societies and providing valuable insights into the broader context of European archaeology.",
        "The proposed project, \"Communities and Connectivities: Iron Age Britons and their Continental Neighbours,\" aims to conduct groundbreaking research in the field of Iron Age European Archaeology from 800 BC to AD 100. By utilizing methodologies such as ancient DNA analysis, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeological approaches, and cultural archaeological approaches, the project seeks to achieve objectives like mapping genetic clusters, addressing population movement, exploring inter-regional connectivity, and examining social dynamics.\n\nThe scale of analysis will involve studying 1000 individuals in the UK and 250 individuals in Europe, making this the first genome-wide ancient DNA analysis of Iron Age populations. The expected outcomes include a new vision of Iron Age communities, shedding light on household compositions, familial relationships, gender-specific mobility, and the development of social inequalities.\n\nThe project team boasts expertise in ancient DNA, isotope analysis, osteoarchaeology, chronological modelling, and cultural archaeology, positioning them well to achieve these objectives. The broader impact of this research is significant, as it sets a benchmark for future archaeological analyses in Europe and beyond.\n\nOverall, \"Communities and Connectivities\" promises to contribute valuable insights into Iron Age societies, fostering a deeper understanding of the connections between Britons and their continental neighbors during this critical period in history.",
