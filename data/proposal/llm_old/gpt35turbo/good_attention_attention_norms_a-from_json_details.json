        "The proposed project, \"Good attention: Attention norms and their role in practical reason, epistemology, and ethics,\" seeks to conduct a groundbreaking interdisciplinary investigation into the fundamental norms of attention and their implications in various fields such as Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and more. The primary goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding attention norms and their impact on practical reason, epistemology, and ethics. \n\nThrough research activities that include investigating the biological function of relevance processing, examining the role of social relevance in attention guidance, and analyzing the epistemic and ethical implications of attention norms, the project aims to shed light on how attention norms emerge and influence individual psychology and societal norms. The hypothesis that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance will be rigorously evaluated and integrated into normative philosophy.\n\nThe expected impact of the project includes advancing philosophical fields by integrating attention norms, providing a novel analytical framework for policy making, and developing a unified foundation for the study of attention norms. By focusing on priority structures that organize the mind, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of attention norms and their broader implications for human cognition and behavior.",
        "The \"Good attention: Attention norms and their role in practical reason, epistemology, and ethics\" project, with the acronym GOODATTENTION, aims to conduct an interdisciplinary and ground-breaking investigation into attention norms and their implications in various fields including Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, and Economics. The primary goal is to develop a conceptual framework for understanding attention norms and explore their impact on practical reason, epistemology, and ethics.\n\nThrough research activities such as examining the biological function of relevance processing, investigating the epistemic role of attention, and analyzing ethical rights and duties regarding attention, the project seeks to understand how attention norms emerge within individuals and society. The hypothesis that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance will guide the exploration.\n\nThe project's objectives include integrating attention norms into normative philosophy and providing a foundation for policy-making by impacting philosophical fields with a novel analytical framework. The expected impact of the project is to advance the study of attention norms by developing a unified foundation based on priority structures that organize the mind.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the understanding of attention norms and their role in shaping human cognition, behavior, and ethical decision-making across various disciplines.",
        "The \"Good attention: Attention norms and their role in practical reason, epistemology, and ethics\" project, with the acronym GOODATTENTION, seeks to conduct a groundbreaking interdisciplinary investigation into the fundamental norms of attention. This project aims to understand how attention norms emerge within individual psychology and the social domain, and to evaluate them through the lens of normative philosophy. The primary goal is to provide a philosophical framework for thinking about attention norms, with a focus on relevance as a central norm.\n\nThrough research activities such as examining the biological function of relevance processing, analyzing the epistemic role of attention, and investigating the ethical rights and duties regarding attention, this project will impact philosophical fields by integrating attention norms and provide an analytical framework for policy making. The project will develop a unified foundation for the study of attention norms using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind.\n\nBy addressing the role of attention norms in decision making, social norms, and ethical considerations, this project aims to contribute significantly to the fields of Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and beyond. The results of this project have the potential to reshape how we understand and think about attention in practical reason, epistemology, and ethics."
