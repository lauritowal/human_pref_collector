        "The proposed project, \"NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,\" aims to address the limitations of current building information modeling (BIM) tools that focus primarily on physical and material characteristics, lacking context, intended use, and user considerations. These limitations result in an inability to predict a building's impact on future users' lives and activities and assess whether a building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nThe research aims to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that includes form, function, and use information in building models. By improving current BIM systems to incorporate user behavior and context, the project seeks to enhance the design of buildings and predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment more accurately.\n\nThe proposed research is grounded in the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth, emphasizing the importance of considering human behavior and context in building design. The project's outcomes are expected to result in better-designed buildings and an enhanced ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment.\n\nThis grant proposal argues for the development of advanced BIM systems that go beyond physical aspects like lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability to include user behavior and context, ultimately leading to more sustainable and user-centric building design.",
        "The proposed project, titled \"NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,\" aims to address the limitations of current tools in building information modeling (BIM). These limitations include inadequate representation of buildings, a focus on physical and material characteristics only, and a lack of context, intended use, and user consideration. As a result, current BIM tools are limited to evaluations based on physical aspects like lighting, energy consumption, and structural stability, which hinders the ability to predict a building's effect on future users' lives and activities and assess whether a building meets its intended users' needs.\n\nThe proposed research seeks to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that includes form, function, and use information in building models. By improving BIM systems to incorporate user behavior and context, the project aims to contribute to better designed buildings and enhance the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment. The research is grounded in the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth.\n\nOverall, this grant proposal advocates for the development of advanced BIM systems that go beyond physical aspects to include user behavior and context for better building design. By addressing the current limitations of BIM tools, the proposed project has the potential to significantly impact the field of architecture and urban planning.",
        "The proposed project, \"NEXT-GENERATION BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TO SUPPORT EVALUATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,\" aims to address the limitations of current tools in building information modeling (BIM) that hinder the evaluation of human behavior in built environments. The current tools are limited in their representation of buildings, focusing primarily on physical and material characteristics while neglecting context, intended use, and user considerations. This leads to a lack of understanding of how buildings impact users' lives and activities, as well as an inadequate assessment of whether buildings meet users' needs.\n\nThe research aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive building modeling method that includes form, function, and use information in building models. By improving current BIM systems to incorporate user behavior and context, the proposed research seeks to yield better designed buildings and enhance the ability to predict user behavior and interaction in the built environment. The context of this research is grounded in the recognized impact of the built environment on life on Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal advocates for the advancement of BIM systems to better account for user behavior and context, ultimately leading to more effective building design and a deeper understanding of how built environments influence human activities."
