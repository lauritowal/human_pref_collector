        "The proposed project, titled \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism,\" aims to address the increasing relevance of foraging in a post-2008 financial crisis economic context, against the backdrop of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The project seeks to develop a political ecology of foraging, focusing on examples such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US.\n\nWith a research base at the Rachel Carson Center, LMU Munich, the project will involve an interdisciplinary team of five international researchers grounded in anthropology. The planned outputs include two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition, all aimed at shedding light on foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy in the Anthropocene.\n\nGiven the patchy mainstream attention to foraging, this project seeks to fill a crucial gap in understanding the significance of foraging practices in today's world. By examining foraging through a political ecology lens, the project aims to contribute valuable insights to both academia and broader societal discussions on sustainable practices and economic alternatives.",
        "The grant proposal \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\" seeks to investigate the phenomenon of foraging in the post-2008 financial crisis economic context, amidst the backdrop of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. With foraging becoming increasingly relevant globally, exemplified by activities such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US, there is a patchy mainstream attention on this topic.\n\nThe project's objective is to develop a political ecology of foraging within the context of the Anthropocene, with a research team of five international researchers grounded in anthropology, affiliated with the Rachel Carson Center at LMU Munich. The academic field of study is interdisciplinary, aiming to produce two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition.\n\nBy exploring foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy, this project aims to fill a gap in existing research and contribute valuable insights to the understanding of foraging practices in the modern world. The proposed outputs will not only advance scholarly knowledge but also have the potential to inform policy and public discourse on sustainable resource use and socio-environmental dynamics.",
        "The grant proposal \"Foraging at the Edge of Capitalism\" seeks to explore the intersection of foraging practices with the post-2008 financial crisis and the pressing issues of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The relevance of foraging has increased globally, as evidenced by various examples such as yartsagunbu collection in Tibet and Nepal, woolly mammoth ivory scavenging in Siberia, artisanal mining in Amazonia and Mongolia, and Amazon nomads in the US. Despite this, mainstream attention to foraging remains patchy.\n\nThe objective of the project is to develop a political ecology of foraging within the context of the Anthropocene. The research will be grounded in anthropology and conducted by an international team of five researchers affiliated with the Rachel Carson Center at LMU Munich. The planned outputs of the project include two monographs, three edited collections, three PhD theses, twelve peer-reviewed articles, a film, and an exhibition.\n\nBy examining foraging as a socio-environmental entanglement and economic strategy, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities and implications of foraging practices in the contemporary world. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will allow for a comprehensive exploration of foraging at the edge of capitalism, shedding light on its significance in the current economic and environmental landscape."
