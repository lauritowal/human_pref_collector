        "The \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\" grant proposal aims to investigate the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments across Europe. This project will involve documenting, studying, and conceptualizing these representations at hundreds of sites. \n\nThe research impact of this study will be significant, with initial outcomes including documentation and surveys, and long-term benefits such as new insights, comparative studies, and enhanced conceptualization. The study will focus on various aspects such as icons, maps, networks, interactive multimedia, spaces, and places, contributing to the fields of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices.\n\nResearch activities will include field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and grouping monuments into clusters. Collaborative methods such as discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences will be employed to enhance the research process. The publication plan includes various outputs throughout the stages of research, culminating in a book at the end of the project.\n\nOverall, this project seeks to shed light on the significance of Jerusalem in European monuments, offering valuable insights into the intersection of culture, history, and memory in the representation of sacred spaces.",
        "The \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network\" grant proposal aims to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe. This innovative project will focus on hundreds of sites across Europe, exploring the intersections of iconography, mapping, network formation, interactive multimedia, space, and place in the representation of Jerusalem.\n\nThrough field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, and the grouping of monuments into clusters, this research will provide new insights and contribute to a comparative study and conceptualization of the role of these monuments in pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. Collaborative methods such as discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences will facilitate the exchange of ideas and enhance the research outcomes.\n\nThe anticipated research impact includes the initial goals of documentation and survey, leading to long-term outcomes such as the development of new insights and a comprehensive comparative study. The publication plan includes various outputs throughout the research stages and culminates in a book at the end of the project.\n\nOverall, this project will deepen our understanding of the representations of Jerusalem in Europe, shedding light on the cultural, religious, and historical significance of these monuments and their role in shaping collective memories and identities.",
        "The proposed project, \"Projections of Jerusalem in Europe: A Monumental Network,\" aims to document, study, and conceptualize the multimedia, interactive re-creations of Jerusalem through monuments in Europe. With an anticipated number of sites in the hundreds, this project will have a significant research impact both in the initial stages through documentation and surveying, as well as in the long term by providing new insights, enabling comparative studies, and facilitating the conceptualization of these representations.\n\nThe study will focus on various aspects including icons, maps, networks, interactive multimedia, spaces, and places, while contributing to the fields of pilgrimage, sacred spaces, devotionalism, memory, and mnemonic practices. Research activities will involve field and textual documentation, cross-referencing, grouping of monuments, and crystallization of clusters. Collaborative methods such as discussions, working papers, symposia, and conferences will be utilized to enhance the research process.\n\nThe publication plan for this project includes various outputs throughout the stages of research, culminating in a book at the end of the research period. By delving into the representations of Jerusalem in European monuments, this project will offer valuable insights into the intersections of culture, religion, and memory in a transnational context."
