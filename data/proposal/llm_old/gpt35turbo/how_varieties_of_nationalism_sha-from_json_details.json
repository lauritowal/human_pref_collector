        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics\". The objective of this project is to examine how nationalism influences electoral politics in advanced democracies and to evaluate the potential for national identities to either divide or unite people. The research framework contrasts the traditional transnational cleavage model with a new perspective that focuses on different varieties of nationalism. \n\nThe project will utilize a multi-method comparative research design, with three main work packages. The first package involves analyzing novel survey data to understand how public conceptions of nationalism contribute to partisan divisions. The second package will investigate how elites mobilize support based on different varieties of nationalism. The third package will explore how elite appeals to national identities impact public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nThe expected contributions of this project include advancements in academic research on nationalism and its effects on politics, as well as enriching public debates on societal challenges related to nationalism. This project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the role of nationalism in shaping polarized politics in advanced democracies.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of nationalism on polarized politics in advanced democracies. Titled \"How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics,\" the project aims to understand how different national identities can either divide or unite populations. The research framework contrasts the traditional view of a transnational cultural cleavage with a new perspective that focuses on the diverse manifestations of nationalism.\n\nThe proposed theoretical approach involves a multi-method comparative research design. The project comprises three work packages: analyzing survey data to explore how public conceptions of nationalism influence partisan divisions, examining elite mobilization strategies based on different varieties of nationalism, and assessing the effects of elite appeals to national identities on public opinion and partisan hostility.\n\nThe expected contributions of this study include advancements in academic research on nationalism and its political implications, as well as enriching public debate on societal challenges related to identity and polarization. By shedding light on the ways in which nationalism shapes political discourse and behavior, this project aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and the general public.",
        "The grant proposal, \"How Varieties of Nationalism Shape Our Polarized Politics,\" aims to investigate the role of nationalism in driving political polarization within advanced democracies. The project seeks to explore how different manifestations of nationalism influence electoral dynamics and assess the potential for national identities to either divide or unite populations. By contrasting the conventional transnational cleavage framework with a new perspective emphasizing diverse forms of nationalism, the research will employ a multi-method comparative approach to analyze the impact of national identity on partisan divisions.\n\nThe project consists of three distinct work packages that involve analyzing survey data to understand public perceptions of nationalism, examining elite mobilization strategies rooted in varying nationalist ideologies, and evaluating how elite appeals to national identities influence public opinion and partisan animosity. The expected contributions of this research include advancements in academic knowledge on nationalism and polarization, as well as enriching public debates on societal challenges related to identity politics. By shedding light on the complex interplay between nationalism and political polarization, this project aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and the general public alike."
