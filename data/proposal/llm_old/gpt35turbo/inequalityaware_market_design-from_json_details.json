        "The grant proposal \"Inequality-aware Market Design\" seeks to explore the optimal design of marketplaces with inequalities using the framework of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). The project aims to develop a mechanism-design framework that maximizes welfare with redistributive preferences, taking into account private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights of participants. The main hypothesis posits that sacrificing allocative efficiency for a desirable surplus split is warranted when detectable inequalities are present. \n\nThrough this research, the project will address inequality in market-design settings, moving beyond the traditional focus on efficiency and revenue. The proposed methodology will examine potential outcomes such as inefficient rationing and provide policy guidance on distortionary market interventions in light of inequality concerns. The project will also explore complementary approaches such as public-finance through the tax system. By studying real-world policy examples like rent control, health care, and transit, the project aims to inform policymakers on introducing rules that constrain transactions and distribute scarce resources without markets. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how market design can be tailored to address inequalities effectively.",

The project will utilize a mechanism-design framework to maximize welfare with redistributive preferences, taking into account private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights of participants. The main hypothesis of the project is that sacrificing allocative efficiency for a desirable surplus split is necessary when inequalities are detectable. The project will provide theoretical contributions by addressing inequality in market-design settings, distinguishing itself from traditional mechanism-design approaches focused solely on efficiency and revenue.\n\nThrough this research, the project seeks to provide policy guidance on how to explain distortionary market interventions in light of inequality concerns. By considering potential outcomes such as inefficient rationing, the project will also explore complementary approaches such as public-finance through the tax system. Overall, the project aims to provide insights into the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of inequalities, offering valuable contributions to both academia and policymaking.",
        "The proposed project, \"Inequality-aware Market Design,\" aims to explore the optimal design of marketplaces with inequalities, using the theoretical framework of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). The project will utilize a mechanism-design framework to develop a welfare function that maximizes welfare with redistributive preferences. By incorporating participant information such as private information on willingness to trade and welfare weights, the project hypothesizes that sacrificing allocative efficiency for a desirable surplus split when inequalities are detectable may lead to more equitable outcomes. \n\nThe project will focus on potential outcomes such as inefficient rationing, with the goal of addressing inequality in market-design settings and distinguishing itself from traditional mechanism-design approaches that prioritize efficiency and revenue. To complement this approach, the project will offer policy guidance on explaining distortionary market interventions in light of inequality concerns, with a view to providing insights for policymakers on how to navigate market design in the presence of inequalities. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to the development of more equitable market structures through a combination of theoretical analysis and practical policy recommendations."
