        "The \"Long-Term Investment\" grant proposal aims to conduct a comprehensive study on the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three interconnected components. The project will explore how firms' characteristics have evolved from being capital-intensive and focused on cost efficiency in the 20th century to competing on product quality and relying on intangible assets in the 21st century, such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. \n\nThe proposal will investigate the comparison between tangible and intangible assets, highlighting how investing in intangible assets may take years to yield results. It will also examine the managerial pressure faced by firms to maximize short-term earnings, potentially hindering long-term investment decisions. \n\nThe three key components of the study include Financial Markets, Incentives, and Effects of Investment. The research will delve into how traditional views in financial markets may discourage long-term investment due to short-term shareholder focus, with a focus on determining the efficiency of information channels. The study on incentives will analyze the level of pay and pay sensitivity to performance, particularly exploring the optimal incentive horizon and its impact on long-term decisions. Lastly, the project will aim to demonstrate the benefits of long-term investment, particularly in the realm of corporate social responsibility, and establish a linkage to firm value. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry practitioners on fostering a conducive environment for long-term investment strategies.",
        "The \"Long-Term Investment\" grant proposal aims to conduct a comprehensive study on the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three interconnected components. The proposed project will investigate the shift in firm characteristics from the 20th century, where firms were capital-intensive and competed on cost efficiency, to the 21st century, where firms now compete on product quality and rely heavily on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture. \n\nOne key focus of the study will be on the managerial pressure to maximize short-term earnings, which often conflicts with the long-term investment strategy. The project will delve into the impact of financial markets on long-term investment decisions, with a specific emphasis on how traditional views discourage such investments due to short-term shareholder focus. Additionally, the research will explore the role of incentives in promoting long-term investment, particularly in terms of pay structures and performance sensitivity.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of long-term investment, with a specific focus on linking these investments to firm value and corporate social responsibility. By analyzing the efficiency of information channels, optimal incentive horizons, and the effects of long-term decisions, this study seeks to inform policy and practice in promoting sustainable and profitable long-term investment strategies.",
        "The \"Long-Term Investment\" grant proposal aims to investigate the determinants and consequences of long-term investment in modern firms, focusing on the shift from capital-intensive, cost-efficient models in the 20th century to quality-driven, intangible asset-dependent models in the 21st century. This study will be conducted through three interconnected components: Financial Markets, Incentives, and Effects of Investment.\n\nThe project will explore how traditional financial markets discourage long-term investment due to short-term shareholder focus, and analyze the efficiency of information channels in incorporating future investment opportunities. It will also investigate the impact of incentives on long-term decision-making, particularly in terms of pay levels and sensitivity to performance over time.\n\nOne of the key challenges of this study will be demonstrating the benefits of long-term investment, with a specific focus on its link to corporate social responsibility and firm value. By examining the role of intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture in driving long-term success, this research aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, managers, and investors looking to promote sustainable growth and value creation in modern businesses."
