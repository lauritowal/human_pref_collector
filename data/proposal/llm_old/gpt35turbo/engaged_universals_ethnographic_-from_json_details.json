        "The proposed project, \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the public good in Africa,\" aims to conduct anthropological research on the implementation and impact of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African countries. UHC, defined as ensuring that all people can access necessary health services without financial hardship, is a key policy under the Sustainable Development Goals with implications for state-citizen relationships and social protection systems. \n\nThe project will address historical issues such as structural-adjustment policies, state capacity reduction, and privatization that have hindered the development of national health-care systems in Africa. By focusing on actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, the research will explore formal and informal mechanisms supporting health, as well as national histories and social practices shaping UHC implementation. \n\nUtilizing a multi-sited, multi-level ethnographic approach, the project aims to contribute to new research directions and generate knowledge with relevance beyond Africa. By studying how UHC is interpreted and implemented in diverse contexts, the project seeks to shed light on the challenges and opportunities in achieving UHC as a public good. This research has the potential to inform policy-making and improve health outcomes in Africa and beyond.",
        "The proposed project, \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the public good in Africa,\" seeks to delve into the complexities surrounding the implementation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in the African context. This anthropological study will focus on the policy of UHC, which aims to ensure that all individuals have access to necessary health services without facing financial hardship, in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe project will examine historical issues such as structural-adjustment policies, privatization, and the burden of healthcare costs on the poor that have contributed to the neglect of national health-care systems in Africa. By exploring the actors and institutions at global, national, and local levels, as well as the formal and informal social networks supporting health, the research will shed light on the challenges facing UHC implementation in the region.\n\nThrough a multi-sited, multi-level ethnographic approach, the project will contribute to new research directions and enhance understanding of UHC beyond Africa. By investigating the impact of UHC on state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions in three African countries, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the complexities of achieving universal health coverage in the region.",
        "The \"Engaged Universals: Ethnographic explorations of ‘Universal Health Coverage’ and the public good in Africa\" grant proposal seeks to delve into the complex landscape of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Africa, with a specific focus on how it intersects with state-citizen relationships, social protection systems, and public health perceptions. The project, rooted in anthropological research methodologies, aims to unravel the nuances of UHC implementation in three African countries, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities it presents at global, national, and local levels.\n\nDrawing on a multi-sited, multi-level ethnographic approach, the study will investigate the actors and institutions shaping UHC policies, the dynamics between states and citizens in the provision of healthcare, and the role of both formal systems of social protection and informal social networks in supporting health outcomes. By examining historical issues such as structural-adjustment policies and state capacity reduction, the project seeks to offer new insights into the contested field of UHC in Africa.\n\nThe anticipated contributions of this research extend beyond the African context, offering new research directions and enriching our understanding of the broader implications of UHC for public health and the public good. Through in-depth fieldwork and analysis, this project aspires to inform policy debates, inspire future studies, and foster a more nuanced appreciation of the complexities surrounding UHC implementation in Africa and beyond."
