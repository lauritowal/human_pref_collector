        "The METABODY project aims to explore the intricate relationship between body metacognition, mentalization, and metamorphosis. The project introduces the concept of Body Imagining, which captures the dynamic inference of body image based on prior expectations and new information. In a modern context where identity balance is a negotiation between invariance and invention, METABODY seeks to investigate body image disturbances and their relation to 1st and 2nd order abilities.\n\nThrough empirical work packages focusing on Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making, the project aims to understand the balance between embodied experience and external, social, and ideal perspectives. By examining the balance of prior beliefs and new information in the context of body modification options, METABODY strives to shed light on identity negotiation processes.\n\nThe proposed research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how individuals perceive and modify their bodies, ultimately leading to insights that can inform interventions and support individuals in achieving a healthier relationship with their bodies. The outcomes of this project have the potential to impact fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and health sciences, ultimately benefiting individuals navigating body image complexities in today's society.",
        "The proposed project, METABODY: Body Metacognition, Mentalization and Metamorphosis, introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining to explore the dynamic inference of body image through the interplay of prior expectations and new information. This study focuses on understanding body image disturbances in relation to 1st and 2nd order abilities, with a particular emphasis on the negotiation between invariance and invention in shaping identity balance in a modern context.\n\nThrough a series of empirical work packages including Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making, the project aims to investigate the balance between embodied experience, external perspectives, social influences, and future considerations in the context of body modification options. By examining body image as a dynamic inference process that involves the integration of prior beliefs and new information, METABODY seeks to advance our understanding of identity negotiation and the role of metacognitive processes in shaping perceptions of the self.\n\nOverall, this project seeks to contribute to the fields of psychology and cognitive science by shedding light on the complex interplay between body image phenomena, metacognition, and social influences, ultimately providing insights that can inform interventions for individuals experiencing body image disturbances.",
        "The METABODY project aims to explore the intricate relationship between body metacognition, mentalization, and metamorphosis. The project introduces the innovative concept of Body Imagining, which involves the dynamic inference of body image based on prior expectations and new information. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the modern context, where individuals constantly negotiate between maintaining a sense of identity and embracing new forms of self-expression.\n\nThe study focuses on understanding body image disturbances in relation to 1st and 2nd order abilities, emphasizing the importance of balancing prior beliefs with new information. Through a series of empirical work packages, including Body Metacognition, Body Mentalizing, and Body Decision Making, the project seeks to explore the interplay between embodied experiences, external perspectives, and social influences.\n\nBy investigating the metacognitive level of body image perception and decision-making processes, METABODY aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of identity negotiation in the context of body modification options. Ultimately, this research has the potential to enhance our understanding of how individuals navigate the delicate balance between invariance and invention in shaping their sense of self through bodily transformations."
