        "The proposed project, \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aims to revolutionize the way digital data about historical phenomena is created and curated for historians, focusing specifically on medieval history. By re-framing historical data as assertions linked to an authority, this project will allow for the manipulation of data according to source and authority, enabling the linking of assertions based on corroboration, dependency, or conflict.\n\nOne of the key novel aspects of this project is its acknowledgment of the complexity of pre-modern history, where few facts are undisputed. The challenge lies in contextualizing and reusing existing online data to prevent waste. The project will focus on the late 11th century, specifically the period between c. 1030–1095, with a primary geographical scope on the eastern half of Christendom and additional focus on the newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe.\n\nBy examining trans-regional trends that are often obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom, this project aims to provide new insights into this crucial period of history. The research disciplines involved include prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to view history from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework, opening up new avenues for historical research and understanding.",

This novel approach acknowledges the complexity of pre-modern history, characterized by few undisputed facts.\n\nThe project's primary challenge lies in contextualizing and reusing existing online data to prevent waste.

        "The proposed project, \"Re-evaluating the Eleventh Century through Linked Events and Entities,\" aims to revolutionize the way digital data about historical phenomena is created and curated for historians, with a focus on medieval history. By re-framing historical data as linked assertions tied to an authority, the project will enable the manipulation and linking of data based on sources and authority, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095) in the eastern half of Christendom and newly Christianized kingdoms of central Europe.\n\nThis project's novel aspect lies in its acknowledgment of the complexity of pre-modern history, where few facts are undisputed, and its challenge lies in contextualizing and reusing existing online data to prevent waste. Through the examination of trans-regional trends obscured by regional narratives, particularly in eastern Christendom, this project aims to shed light on hidden historical significance.\n\nDrawing on research disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, the project's ultimate goal is to view history from multiple perspectives using a traceable authority framework. By developing and testing new methods for historical data analysis, this project has the potential to reshape the field of medieval history and pave the way for a more nuanced understanding of the eleventh century."
