        "The FARE_AUDIT project, titled \"FARE_AUDIT: Fake News Recommendations - an Auditing System of Differential Tracking and Search Engine Results,\" aims to investigate the influence of browsing history on search engine results and the likelihood of being directed to disinformation. The project seeks to create an innovative auditing system that allows democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time, breaching information bubbles by simulating different user online profiles. The tool features privacy-protecting web-crawlers and does not require real user data.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include increasing public awareness of search engines' role in spreading disinformation and equipping organizations with a tool for detecting and monitoring disinformation. The proposed technology shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting addresses the lack of efforts to understand and mitigate the spread of disinformation through search engines.\n\nOverall, the FARE_AUDIT project represents a crucial step towards combating the dissemination of fake news and disinformation online. By developing a sophisticated auditing system, this project has the potential to significantly impact public awareness and empower organizations in the fight against online misinformation.",

        "The FARE_AUDIT project aims to address the critical issue of disinformation spread through search engines by developing a Fake News Recommendations Auditing System. This system will analyze how browsing history influences search engine results, leading to the dissemination of false information. By creating an innovative auditing tool for search engines, using privacy-protecting web-crawlers, and without requiring real user data, FARE_AUDIT will enable democracy-promoting institutions and concerned citizens to identify new disinformation in near real-time.\n\nThe project's objectives include breaching information bubbles by simulating different user online profiles, increasing public awareness of search engines' role in disinformation spread, and equipping organizations with a powerful disinformation detection and monitoring tool. FARE_AUDIT represents a technology shift from cookie-tracking to fingerprinting, offering a more accurate and privacy-preserving approach to understanding search engine algorithms' impact on information dissemination.\n\nBy addressing the lack of efforts to comprehend and mitigate the role of search engines in spreading disinformation, the FARE_AUDIT project has the potential to make significant contributions to combating fake news and promoting a more informed society."
