        "The proposed project, \"It's about time: Towards a dynamic account of natural vision,\" aims to revolutionize the study of vision by exploring it in a more natural setting and understanding it as a process geared towards semantic understanding. By investigating active information sampling in vision and analyzing vision across multiple timeframes, this interdisciplinary project will utilize non-invasive human brain imaging and large-scale computational modeling to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe project will involve visual exploration of tens of thousands of rich human-annotated natural scenes, the development of novel multivariate analysis techniques, and the creation of a new bio-inspired deep learning framework for active vision. Through these methods, the project seeks to establish when, where, and how visual semantic understanding emerges in the brain and integrate information from the world in a continuously updating and dynamic decision process.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project includes a paradigm shift in studying, modeling, and understanding vision, new insights into complex neural processes in ecologically valid conditions, and a closer alignment between biological and synthetic vision. Overall, the project, TIME, proposes a new approach to study higher-level vision as an active, semantic, and temporally dynamic process, with the potential to transform our understanding of vision.",
