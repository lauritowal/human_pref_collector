        "The \"Forced Migration and Development\" grant proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of forced migration in developing countries, where 85% of the 68.5 million displaced individuals are hosted. The project, FORCEDMIGDEV, aims to analyze the economic consequences of forced migration in these regions.\n\nThe project is structured into two key parts. The first part focuses on refugee inflows, with activities including the development of a structural model, estimation of the model, and investigation of Syrian refugees in Turkey. This part addresses questions related to the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare effects across regions, and the impact of legal status for refugees.\n\nThe second part of the project delves into the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement, combining reduced-form and structural methods. Activities include estimating reduced-form effects in Brazil, developing a quantitative spatial model, and assessing the long-run effects of internal displacement in the country. This part intersects the realms of climate and development economics.\n\nBy undertaking this comprehensive analysis, the project aims to provide crucial insights into the economic implications of forced migration on developing countries. The grant will support the research team in conducting rigorous analyses, producing valuable findings, and ultimately contributing to evidence-based policy recommendations for addressing the challenges posed by forced migration on economic development.",
        "The \"Forced Migration and Development\" grant proposal aims to address the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, focusing on the impact of refugee inflows and climate shocks on internal displacement. With 68.5 million displaced individuals globally, 85% hosted by developing countries, there is an urgent need to understand the distributional and welfare effects of these shocks.\n\nThe project, labeled FORCEDMIGDEV, will analyze the economic implications of forced migration through a multi-faceted approach. The first part of the project will focus on refugee inflows, developing a structural model to estimate the effects of refugee shocks on different regions and the welfare implications of legal status for refugees, with a specific investigation on Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\nThe second part will examine the impact of climate shocks on internal displacement, using a combination of reduced-form and structural methods to estimate the effects in Brazil. A quantitative spatial model will be developed to assess the long-run consequences of internal displacement, at the intersection of climate and development economics.\n\nBy addressing key questions such as the distributional effects of refugee shocks and the long-term implications of climate-induced displacement, this project seeks to provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners working on forced migration and development issues in developing countries.",
        "The \"Forced Migration and Development\" grant proposal aims to address the economic consequences of forced migration in developing countries, particularly focusing on the challenges faced by displaced individuals. With over 68.5 million people currently displaced globally, 85% of whom are hosted by developing countries, it is imperative to understand the impact of such crises on both the displaced populations and the host communities.\n\nThe project, labeled FORCEDMIGDEV, will involve an in-depth analysis of the economic implications of forced migration through two key components. The first component will concentrate on refugee inflows, including the development of a structural model to estimate the distributional and welfare effects of refugee shocks, with a specific focus on Syrian refugees in Turkey. The second component will explore the effects of climate shocks on internal displacement, utilizing a combination of reduced-form and structural methods to assess the long-term implications of displacement in Brazil, while also considering the intersection of climate and development economics.\n\nBy addressing critical questions such as the distributional effects of refugee shocks, welfare impacts across regions, and the importance of legal status for refugees, this project seeks to provide valuable insights that can inform policy-making and development strategies in regions affected by forced migration. Through rigorous analysis and multidisciplinary approaches, the \"Forced Migration and Development\" grant proposal aims to contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between forced migration and economic development in developing countries."
