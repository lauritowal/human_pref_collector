        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the role of digital media in shaping transnational memories of disappearance, focusing on the case study of the 43 students who disappeared in Mexico in September 2014. The project aims to explore the impact of new media on citizen engagement and counter-movements against the Mexican government, with a specific focus on theoretical and multidisciplinary approaches. By comparing Mexico's case to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, the project will develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope. \n\nThrough this research, the project will examine the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries transgression in digital memory. The significance of this study lies in its potential to deepen our understanding of how digital media influences the construction of transnational memories of disappearance and its implications for citizen engagement and activism. The project's outcomes will contribute to the academic discourse on memory studies, digital media, and transnational social movements, providing valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and activists working in this field.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance\", focuses on the impact of digital media on shaping transnational memories of disappearances, with a specific case study on the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. The project aims to explore how new media influences citizen engagement and counter-movements against the Mexican government. \n\nThe proposed approaches include theoretical analysis of disappearance as a crime and digital memory, as well as a multidisciplinary examination of the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World. The project also incorporates a comparative aspect, comparing Mexico's case to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina. \n\nThe expected output of the project is a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope. The project will delve into the ontological status of the disappeared and boundaries transgression in digital memory. \n\nUltimately, this grant proposal seeks to contribute to the understanding of how digital media shapes transnational memories of disappearances and how these memories influence social movements and citizen engagement on a global scale.",
        "The proposed project, \"We are all Ayotzinapa: The role of Digital Media in the Shaping of Transnational Memories on Disappearance,\" aims to investigate the impact of digital media on the formation of transnational memories related to the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. The project will focus on how new media platforms have influenced citizen engagement and counter-movements against the Mexican government. \n\nUtilizing theoretical and multidisciplinary approaches, the study will analyze the concept of disappearance as a crime within digital memory, as well as explore the long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World. By comparing Mexico's case to social performances and artistic representations in Spain and Argentina, the project seeks to develop a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects and networked social movements with a transnational scope.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the ontological status of the disappeared and the boundaries transgression in digital memory. By shedding light on how digital media shapes transnational memories of disappearance, this project has the potential to contribute valuable insights to the fields of memory studies, digital media, and transnational activism."
