        "The proposed project, \"Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature,\" seeks to challenge the dominance of English language and Western perspectives in the global literary landscape. Focusing on regions such as north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, the project aims to explore the intersections of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions within the context of imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment.\n\nBy positioning non-Western literature within a global timeline and map, the project aims to ensure its entry into the global canon and challenge the provincial label that limits its circulation. Through a multilingual and located approach, the project seeks to critique the monolingual straitjacket and modern literary histories that have partitioned literary traditions.\n\nThe outcomes of this project include a new theoretical approach to world literature, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues with collaborators from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France. By exploring the dynamics of appropriation, co-constitution, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories in literary production, this project aims to contribute to a more inclusive and diverse understanding of world literature.",
        "The grant proposal \"Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature\" seeks to challenge the dominance of English and Western perspectives in the global literary canon by focusing on non-Western literature from regions such as north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia. Through a multilingual and located approach, the project aims to explore the complexities of literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions within the context of imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment.\n\nBy examining local transculturations, debates on world literature, forms of multilingualism, and the actors and technologies of print and orality, the project intends to highlight the multiplicity of choices and trajectories in literary creation and reception. The outcomes of this research will include a theoretical approach to redefining world literature, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues on the importance of diverse linguistic and cultural perspectives in the global literary landscape.\n\nCollaborating with countries such as Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France, this project aims to create a more inclusive and representative understanding of world literature that reflects the richness and diversity of global literary traditions. Through this work, the project seeks to ensure that non-Western literature is recognized and valued within the global literary canon.",
        "This grant proposal, titled \"Multilingual locals, significant geographies: a new approach to world literature,\" aims to redefine the concept of world literature by focusing on multilingual locals and significant geographies. The project will study regions in north India, Morocco, and Ethiopia, examining key concepts such as literary multilingualism, colonial diglossia, and oral traditions. By challenging the dominance of English and the Western literary canon, the proposal seeks to position non-Western literature within a global context.\n\nThe project will adopt a multilingual and located approach, critiquing the limitations of monolingual perspectives and modern literary histories. Through a focus on periods of imperial consolidation, decolonization, and the current globalizing moment, the study will explore local transculturations, debates on world literature, forms of multilingualism, and the actors and technologies of print and orality.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a theoretical approach to world literature, methods for multilingual training and research, and strategic dialogues with collaborators from Morocco, Ethiopia, India, the UK, and France. By highlighting the dynamics of appropriation, co-constitution, and the multiplicity of choices and trajectories in literature, this project aims to contribute to a more inclusive and diverse understanding of global literary traditions."
