        "The \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\" project aims to revolutionize the utilization of social science in policy-making. Focused on the Horizon 2020 program, this project seeks to construct a new approach that addresses the current emphasis on knowledge production while neglecting knowledge use. By delving into the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualizing objectivity and deliberation, and exploring the role of values in the science/society interface, K4U will provide practical insights for policy design and deliberation.\n\nThe project's objectives include developing a practical understanding that balances effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. Rooted in a Popperian philosophical approach, K4U aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by offering a philosophy for practice and launching the field of social technology philosophy.\n\nThrough this innovative project, K4U will contribute to the advancement of policy-making by providing users with intelligible and practical insights to evaluate and balance various aspects of proposed policies. By shifting the focus towards knowledge use, this project has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness and impact of social policies.",
        "The \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\" grant proposal seeks to address the current issues of emphasis on knowledge production and lack of attention to knowledge use in social science research. This project, to be funded through the Horizon 2020 program, aims to construct a new approach to using social science for better social policies by focusing on the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualization of objectivity and deliberation, and the role of values in the science/society interface.\n\nThe objectives of this project include developing practical understanding for policy design and deliberation, as well as balancing effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. The philosophical approach of the project will be Popperian, with contributions expected to include philosophy for practice and the launch of the philosophy of social technology field.\n\nThrough the implementation of this project, K4U will provide intelligible and practical insights for users to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies. By bridging the gap between knowledge production and knowledge use, this project has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness and impact of social science research on policy development and implementation.",
        "The \"Knowledge For Use [K4U]: Making the Most of Social Science to Build Better Policies\" project aims to revolutionize the utilization of social science in policy-making processes. This Horizon 2020 program will focus on the philosophical study of social science technology, reconceptualization of objectivity and deliberation, and the role of values in the science/society interface. \n\nThe project addresses current issues such as the emphasis on knowledge production over knowledge use. By developing practical understanding for policy design and deliberation, the project seeks to balance effectiveness, evidence, success likelihood, costs, benefits, stakeholders, and acceptability. \n\nUsing a Popperian philosophical approach, the project will contribute to the field by providing philosophy for practice and launching the philosophy of social technology field. The ultimate goal of K4U is to provide intelligible and practical insights for users to estimate and balance various aspects of proposed policies, ensuring that social science is effectively utilized to build better policies. \n\nThrough this project, we hope to bridge the gap between knowledge production and knowledge use, leading to more informed and effective policy decisions that benefit society as a whole."
