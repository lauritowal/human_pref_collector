        "The grant proposal \"Beyond the breadline: Charitable food provision and survival strategies of the urban poor in a comparative perspective\" aims to address the gap in understanding the dynamics of charitable food provision (CFP) and its role in supporting the urban poor. This project is crucial as CFP serves as a vital buffer between food insecurity and hunger, especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession and amidst societal changes with reduced welfare benefits.\n\nThe proposed research will focus on charting the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, while also examining CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. By employing event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, the study will explore the interdependence between food insecurity and support, as well as the influence of agri-food sustainability transitions on CFP.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project is to create new knowledge across multiple studies and provide comparative insights into food support and insecurity. By introducing innovative tools for data collection in city workshops and crafting an overarching framework for CFP comparison, this research aims to contribute significantly to the understanding of CFP in diverse institutional settings and its role in the survival strategies of the urban poor.",
        "The proposed project, \"Beyond the breadline: Charitable food provision and survival strategies of the urban poor in a comparative perspective,\" aims to address the research gaps in understanding the crucial role of charitable food provision (CFP) in buffering food insecurity and hunger among the urban poor. The project will focus on examining the historical trajectory and dynamics of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, specifically in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam. By utilizing event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, the project will investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support, as well as the influence of agri-food sustainability transitions on CFP.\n\nThrough the development of innovative tools for data collection in city workshops, the project seeks to create a robust framework for comparing CFP across countries and cities, shedding light on professionalized CFP sectors, provider interrelationships, ties with state and non-state authorities, and CFP as part of poor people's survival strategies. The anticipated impact includes creating new knowledge and offering comparative insights into food support and insecurity, ultimately extending the comparison of CFP to other contexts. This research will contribute to understanding the shifting landscape of charitable food provision and its significance in the context of reduced welfare benefits and societal changes.",
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a project titled \"Beyond the breadline: Charitable food provision and survival strategies of the urban poor in a comparative perspective.\" The project aims to address the importance of charitable food provision (CFP) as a crucial buffer between food insecurity and hunger, especially in the context of societal changes with reduced welfare benefits. The research will focus on filling the gaps in existing literature by developing a robust framework for comparing CFP across countries and cities, contextualizing CFP in welfare and civil society regimes, and examining the influence of agri-food sustainability transitions on CFP.\n\nThe objectives of the project include charting the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, examining CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, investigating the interdependence between food insecurity and support, introducing a tool for real-time data collection in city workshops, and crafting an overarching framework for CFP comparison. The research will utilize methods such as event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography to explore professionalized CFP sectors, provider interrelationships, ties with state and non-state authorities, and CFP as part of poor people's survival strategies.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project is to create new knowledge across multiple studies and offer comparative insight into food support and insecurity. By combining findings from different countries and cities, this research aims to extend the comparison of CFP to a global scale."
