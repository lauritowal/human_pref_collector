        "The grant proposal \"Crossed Memories, Politics of Silence: The Colonial-Liberation Wars in Postcolonial Times\" seeks to delve into the memories and silences surrounding the wars fought between the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements from 1961 to 1974/5. The research will take a diachronic and comparative approach, focusing on Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that the wars triggered both memorialization and silencing, each with its own historicity.\n\nThe project will explore two main strands: \"Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States\" which will investigate the role of states in past mobilization and representations, and \"Memory as a battlefield\" which will examine the uses of the past and dynamics between social and individual memories. The objectives include producing innovative knowledge about war memories and silences, contrasting changes in memory and silence from the end of conflicts to the present, examining historical judgments and memories in Portugal and African countries, offering a new perspective in colonial-liberation war studies, and addressing the traumatic experiences and historical burdens of European colonialism.\n\nIn summary, the CROME project aims to provide a fresh perspective on the colonial-liberation wars by exploring the evolution and impact of memories and silences in Portugal and its former African colonies.",
