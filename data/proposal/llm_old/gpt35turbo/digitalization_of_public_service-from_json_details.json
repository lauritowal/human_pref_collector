        "The proposed project, titled \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development,\" aims to address the significant challenges faced by low-income countries in providing accessible and quality public services. With an estimated annual death toll of 5.7 million and 100 million individuals pushed into poverty due to limited service access, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions. \n\nDrawing on the success stories from high-income countries and recognizing the challenges faced by low-income nations, this project seeks to conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. By studying the determinants of success or failure of digitalization projects and focusing on improving efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery, the project aims to inform public policy in low-income countries.\n\nCollaborating with local governments and NGOs, the project will explore the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. The ultimate goal is to increase access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment. By addressing the risks of excluding individuals with limited connectivity, this project holds great potential to drive inclusive development and reduce the adverse impacts of inadequate service access.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to address the challenges faced by low-income countries in digitalizing public service delivery to promote inclusive development. The project, titled \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development,\" aims to investigate the determinants of success or failure of digitalization efforts and improve efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery.\n\nWith an estimated annual death toll of 5.7 million and 100 million people pushed into poverty due to limited access to services, there is an urgent need to adopt digital technologies to bridge the gap. While high-income countries have made impressive strides in this area, low-income countries face challenges with a one-third abandonment rate of digitalization projects.\n\nThrough collaboration with local governments and NGOs, this project will conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to study the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring. The ultimate goal is to inform public policy in low-income countries and ensure access to more and higher quality public services for a broader population segment. By addressing the risks of excluding individuals with limited connectivity, this project aims to pave the way for inclusive development through digitalization.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"Digitalization of Public Service Delivery and Inclusive Development\" aims to address the significant challenges faced by low-income countries in providing public services efficiently and inclusively. With an estimated annual death toll of 5,700,000 and an annual poverty rate of 100,000,000 due to limited access to services, the need for innovative solutions is urgent. While high-income countries have made impressive progress in adopting digital technologies, low-income countries face challenges, with a one-third abandonment rate of digitalization projects reported in 2016.\n\nThis project seeks to conduct four experiments in India, Indonesia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to understand the determinants of success or failure in digitalization projects and improve efficiency and inclusion in public service delivery. By focusing on the demand for public services via digital access and the supply of in-person services with remote monitoring, the goal is to inform public policy in low-income countries and ultimately provide more and higher-quality public services to a broader population segment. Collaborating with local governments and NGOs, this research has the potential to transform public service delivery and drive inclusive development on a global scale."
