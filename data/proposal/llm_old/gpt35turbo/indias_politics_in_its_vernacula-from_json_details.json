        "The grant proposal titled \"India's Politics in Its Vernaculars\" aims to address the current gap in knowledge regarding the conceptual foundations of India's political life by focusing on the ideas guiding ordinary Indian citizens' political engagement. The project will employ an ethnographic and historical approach, utilizing vernacular languages to explore the demotic political ideas in India. Collaborating with anthropologists, historians, linguists, and scholars of politics, the project seeks to lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life. \n\nThe proposed project also aims to develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages and explore the implications for global political theory, drawing inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts. The potential impacts of this research include advancing the study of subcontinental politics, providing methodological insights beyond Europe, and contributing to analytical advances towards global political theory. By delving into the vernacular languages of India's political life, this project has the potential to shed light on a significant aspect of the world’s largest democracy and Rising Power, with far-reaching implications for political theory and practice.",
