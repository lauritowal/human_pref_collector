    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks to conduct a groundbreaking comparative developmental investigation into the origins of empathy in humans and bonobos. Utilizing innovative techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, this project will involve longitudinal observations and innovative experiments with human infants from Vanuatu and Samoa, as well as bonobos in both wild and semi-captive contexts. The research goals include identifying the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determining the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, advancing understanding of empathy origins, and challenging perspectives about human uniqueness in empathy. The hypothesis posits that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but diverge in their motivation to ameliorate others' emotional states, with humans possessing a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. The potential outcomes of this study include human-unique sharing and cooperation. By integrating disciplines such as biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to our understanding of the origins of empathy and shed light on the evolutionary pathways that have shaped this critical aspect of social behavior in both humans and non-human primates.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to conduct the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, utilizing innovative techniques such as thermal-imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking. By employing longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, this project aims to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, determine the extent of human uniqueness in empathy, and challenge perspectives about human exceptionalism in this trait. The study will involve human infants from diverse cultures in Vanuatu and Samoa, as well as bonobos in both wild and semi-captive contexts. By exploring societal structures that promote distributed caregiving, the research seeks to uncover the shared core capacity for empathy between humans and bonobos, while also investigating potential divergences in motivation and reciprocal emotional exchange. The interdisciplinary nature of this project, integrating biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, will provide a comprehensive understanding of empathy origins and potential outcomes, including human-unique sharing and cooperation. Ultimately, this research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of empathy and shed light on the evolutionary pathways that have shaped this essential human trait.",
