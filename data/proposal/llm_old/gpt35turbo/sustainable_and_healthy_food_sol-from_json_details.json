        "The FLORA project aims to address the urgent need for sustainable and healthy food solutions on a global scale. Through a systemic approach, the project will analyze the complex dynamics of the agri-food system to identify key threats and opportunities. By integrating health and environmental outcomes, the project will provide essential evidence to guide the transformation of food production, trade, and consumption practices. \n\nThe project's objectives include contributing to a shift in global agri-food practices, creating evidence-based solutions, and identifying the most effective strategies considering trade-offs and synergies. Activities will involve diagnosing the integrated health and environmental impacts of food systems, utilizing system dynamics and complex network analyses, and evaluating tailored solutions through an interdisciplinary modeling framework.\n\nWith a focus on sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption, the FLORA project will leverage the PI's expertise in interdisciplinary research to generate impactful insights and recommendations for a more resilient and equitable food system.",
        "The \"Sustainable and healthy food solutions: system dynamics and trade-offs\" grant proposal, also known as the FLORA project, aims to contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption by creating essential evidence to identify and implement shifts in practices and behaviors. The project will focus on diagnosing integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, identifying key threats and opportunities using system dynamics and complex network analyses, and targeting tailored solutions with an interdisciplinary modeling framework. The approach is systemic, with a global scope and a strong focus on sustainability, health, environment, agriculture, food production, trade, and consumption.\n\nThis innovative project, led by a PI with a proven track record in interdisciplinary research on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts, seeks to enable the identification of the most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics. By addressing these key characteristics, the FLORA project aims to make a significant impact on the sustainability and health of food systems worldwide.",
