        "The proposed project, \"From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,\" seeks to investigate the internalization and institutionalization of combat trauma in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. By combining anthropological study, clinical practices research, and policy analysis, the project aims to develop a comparative framework to understand how combat trauma shapes perceptions, values, and experiences within military and psychiatric institutions. Through ethnographic fieldwork and discourse analysis, the project will identify key problems in veteran care, advance studies in biopolitics and medicalization, and shed light on conflicting values and perceptions of ethnicity in the context of war-related suffering. The research will target veterans and clinicians, with the goal of influencing policy and healthcare practices to better address combat trauma and improve care for those affected. By examining the institutionalization of combat trauma and resistance to clinical illness models, this project holds significant potential to contribute to the fields of anthropology, biopolitics, and medicalization, offering valuable insights into the experience of veterans within military and psychiatric institutions.",
        "The proposed project, \"From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,\" seeks to investigate the internalization and institutionalization of combat trauma in the context of military and psychiatric institutions in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. Through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing anthropology, biopolitics, and medicalization, the research aims to develop a comparative framework that sheds light on conflicting values and perceptions of ethnicity in the treatment of combat trauma.\n\nUsing methodologies such as ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, the project seeks to identify key problems in veteran care, impact policy and healthcare practices, advance studies in biopolitics and medicalization, and deepen the understanding of how war-related suffering is internalized. Targeting veterans and clinicians as key stakeholders, the research holds significance in uncovering the institutionalization of combat trauma, exploring veterans' experiences with ethnicity in military and psychiatric settings, and challenging resistance to clinical illness models.\n\nUltimately, this project aims to contribute to the improvement of care for veterans suffering from combat trauma, influence policy decisions, and advance knowledge in the fields of biopolitics and medicalization. Through its comprehensive and comparative approach, the research seeks to address critical gaps in understanding the complexities of combat trauma and its impact on individuals and institutions.",
        "The proposed project, \"From warfare to welfare: a comparative study of how combat trauma is internalized and institutionalized,\" aims to investigate the internalization and institutionalization of combat trauma in Israel, the United States, and the Netherlands. This anthropological study will focus on the intersections of biopolitics, medicalization, and the experiences of veterans within military and psychiatric institutions. By utilizing ethnographic fieldwork, clinical practices research, policy analysis, and discourse analysis, the project seeks to develop a comparative framework to understand how combat trauma shapes individuals and societies.\n\nThe project's objectives include identifying key issues in veteran care, influencing policy and healthcare practices, advancing knowledge in biopolitics and medicalization, and exploring the internalization of war-related suffering. The research will target veterans and clinicians, shedding light on the complexities of combat trauma institutionalization, veterans' experiences with ethnicity in military and psychiatric contexts, and resistance to clinical illness models.\n\nUltimately, this study has the potential to have a significant impact on the field by providing valuable insights into the complexities of combat trauma and how it is managed within institutional settings. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the project aims to contribute to the understanding of war-related suffering and inform future care and policy decisions."
