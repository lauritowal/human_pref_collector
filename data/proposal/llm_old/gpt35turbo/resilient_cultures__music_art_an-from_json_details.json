        "The \"Resilient Cultures – Music, Art, and Cinema in Mainland China and Hong Kong\" grant proposal aims to investigate the expression of social and political discontent, resilience, and cultural critique in the realms of popular music, contemporary art, and queer cinema in mainland China and Hong Kong. Through a comparative analysis of indie music, folk music, art institutes, socially engaged art projects, and queer cinema and film festivals in localities such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianshui, the project will employ ethnography, textual analysis, digital methods, and collaborative research to explore the ways in which cultural practices develop resilient tactics.\n\nThe project will also engage in network-building activities with regions in mainland China, Hong Kong, East Asia, and Europe, including workshops, podcast series, performances, screenings, and exhibitions. The expected outcomes of the project include promoting multivocality, diversity, and the vitality of cultural production. By placing the research within comparative contexts such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Russia, and Turkey, the project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of how cultural practices navigate authoritarianism and platformization. \"Resilient Cultures\" ultimately aims to shed light on the ways in which music, art, and cinema serve as crucial mediums for resistance and resilience in contemporary socio-political landscapes.",
