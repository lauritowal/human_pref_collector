        "The proposed project, \"Reinforcement learning from post-ingestive calories: from body to brain in health and disease,\" aims to investigate the post-ingestive reinforcement of food-seeking behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms. The objective is to study how behavior related to food consumption is reinforced by post-ingestive calories, with a focus on the dopaminergic substrate and neural activity in brain reward circuits. \n\nThe project will utilize a combination of computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation to investigate these mechanisms in both rodents and humans, under both health and disease contexts. Specifically, the project will explore the selection of food, processing of post-ingestive information, evaluation of energy content, and transmission of vagus nerve information. \n\nExperiments will involve human probabilistic decision-making tasks, with a particular focus on conditions related to obesity. The findings from this project have the potential to provide valuable insights into the neural basis of food-seeking behavior and may have implications for understanding and potentially treating conditions related to unhealthy eating behaviors.",
        "This grant proposal aims to investigate the reinforcement learning mechanisms involved in food-seeking behavior, specifically focusing on post-ingestive calories and their impact on the brain in both health and disease states. The study will explore the hypothesis that food-seeking behavior is underpinned by dopaminergic pathways and is associated with neural activity in brain reward circuits. To achieve this, the project will utilize a combination of computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, as well as peripheral nerve stimulation in both rodent and human subjects across different health and disease contexts. The research will specifically focus on the selection of food, post-ingestive information processing, energy content perception, and vagus nerve information transmission. Additionally, human probabilistic decision-making tasks will be employed to study the effects of post-ingestive calories on behavior in individuals with obesity. Ultimately, this project seeks to deepen our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking behavior and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for conditions such as obesity.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the reinforcement learning mechanisms related to post-ingestive calories and their impact on food-seeking behavior, focusing on the transition from the body to the brain in both health and disease contexts. The objective of the study is to explore the dopaminergic substrate underlying food-seeking behavior and its association with neural activity in brain reward circuits. The proposed methods include computational reinforcement models, instrumental conditioning, brain functional and molecular imaging, and peripheral nerve stimulation, with rodents and humans as the primary subjects. The research will specifically concentrate on the selection of food, post-ingestive information processing, energy content perception, and the role of vagus nerve information transmission.\n\nThe experiments will involve human probabilistic decision-making tasks, with a special focus on conditions related to obesity. By delving into the mechanisms that drive food-seeking behavior, this project aims to shed light on the intricate interplay between sensory feedback, post-ingestive information, and energy regulation. Ultimately, the findings from this study could provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing maladaptive eating behaviors and related disorders."
