        "This grant proposal, titled \"The evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa,\" aims to investigate the origins of Homo sapiens in Africa approximately 750,000 years ago. The project, named NGIPALAJEM, will focus on the Turkana region and address key research goals such as establishing empirical benchmarks and answering significant questions in the field of human evolution.\n\nThe proposed research will involve fieldwork to add specimens to the hominin and large vertebrate fossil record, as well as analyses using inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative techniques. By examining the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas and exploring the phenotypic diversity during the Middle Pleistocene, the project seeks to uncover new insights into human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape.\n\nThe project will also investigate the impact of climatic changes, such as the End of EMPT period, and the discovery of small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins. Utilizing novel morphometric and analytical analysis techniques, the research aims to contribute to a better understanding of human evolution over the last million years.\n\nOverall, the expected outcomes of this project include a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes that led to the emergence of modern humans in Africa, providing valuable insights into our shared evolutionary history.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"The evolutionary landscape of modern human origins in Africa,\" aims to investigate the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens in Africa, focusing on events occurring 750,000 years ago. The project, named NGIPALAJEM, will address the impact of climatic changes starting 1.4 million years ago, particularly the Extended Middle Pleistocene Transition (EMPT) lasting 1 million years, characterized by greater climatic variability and prolonged arid phases. \n\nThe research goals include establishing empirical benchmarks and answering key questions related to human evolution. Fieldwork will be conducted in Turkana to add specimens to the hominin fossil record and increase the large vertebrate fossil record. Analyses will involve inter-site eco-morphological and palaeoproteomic comparative methods, focusing on the role of human predation in shaping modern African faunas. \n\nThe project expects to discover small Middle Pleistocene Turkana hominins, contributing to phenotypic diversity in the Middle Pleistocene. Utilizing novel morphometric and analytical techniques, the study will analyze the fossil record from the last million years. \n\nThe anticipated outcomes of the research include a new understanding of human evolution within the African evolutionary landscape. By addressing major empirical benchmarks and answering significant questions, this project has the potential to shed light on the origins and development of modern humans in Africa.",
