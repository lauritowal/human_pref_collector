        "The \"Wrap It Up: Deciphering experience-dependent myelin growth across development\" grant proposal aims to address a critical question regarding changes in myelin during learning at various developmental stages. This project will focus on assessing changes in myelin during learning, comparing myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals, and probing the entire developmental lifespan, including key milestones such as infants learning to crawl, children entering school, and individuals acquiring new skills like juggling and reading Chinese. \n\nThe methodology of this project will involve an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. The objectives of this research include elucidating the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory and establishing a crucial reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders associated with alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. \n\nThe primary technology used in this study will be MRI to examine myelin changes in the brain. By shedding light on the role of myelin in learning and development, this project has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of human cognition and contribute to the development of interventions for individuals with neurological disorders.",
        "The \"Wrap It Up: Deciphering experience-dependent myelin growth across development\" project, also known as WRAPPED, aims to address a critical question by investigating changes in myelin levels during learning at different developmental stages. This study will focus on assessing variations in myelin within the living human brain over time and between individuals, covering the entire developmental lifespan from infancy to older adulthood. Specifically, the project will evaluate myelin changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when individuals of different ages acquire new skills such as juggling and reading Chinese.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will utilize an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. By doing so, WRAPPED seeks to elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory and establish a crucial reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders associated with alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities. The primary technology used in this research will be MRI, allowing for non-invasive and detailed examination of myelin changes in the brain. Ultimately, the findings from this project have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between myelin development and learning, as well as provide insights into the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders.",
