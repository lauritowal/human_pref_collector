        "The proposed project, titled \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the elderly to places where care is more affordable,\" aims to investigate the transnationalization of care and the relocation of ageing bodies to locations with more affordable care options. This multi-sited anthropological study will focus on countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, with target patients from Austria and Germany. The project will explore the marketization of care, the entanglement of welfare states across borders, and the historical context of German and Habsburg-Hungarian history.\n\nUsing in-depth ethnographic studies, investigations of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and analysis of the histories of places, the research will shed light on the implications of new transnational welfare state entanglements. By examining aspects such as labour migration, real estate investment, state insurances, and regional migration, the project seeks to understand the complexities of care relocation in an interconnected Europe. Furthermore, the study will address the privatization of care landscapes and the question of what it means to age and require care in a transnational context.\n\nOverall, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with relocating care within Europe, with the aim of informing future policies and practices in the field of elderly care.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to fund a research project titled \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the elderly to places where care is more affordable.\" The project focuses on the transnationalization of care and the relocation of ageing bodies to affordable care locations. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as \"grandmother deportation\" or \"geriatric colonialism,\" highlights the marketization of care and the entanglement of welfare states and entitlements across borders.\n\nThe study will take the form of a multi-sited anthropological study, with case studies in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, targeting patients from Austria and Germany. The research will explore the historical context of German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, as well as the language and management aspects of care homes catering to German-speaking patients and local wealthier elderly.\n\nThrough in-depth ethnographic studies, investigation of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and analysis of the histories of places, the project aims to understand the new transnational entanglements of welfare states and the implications of care relocation as part of future-making. By addressing the privatization of care landscapes and the question of what it means to become old and in need of care in an intertwined Europe, this research has the potential to inform policy and practice in the realm of elderly care.",
        "The proposed project, \"Relocating Care within Europe: Moving the elderly to places where care is more affordable,\" aims to investigate the transnationalization of care and the relocation of ageing bodies to more cost-effective care locations. This multi-sited anthropological study will focus on countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, with target patients from Austria and Germany. By comparing the costs of care in these locations to one-third of the cost in their home countries, the project will explore the entanglement of welfare states and entitlements across borders. \n\nWith a historical context rooted in German and Habsburg-Hungarian history, the project will examine care homes catering to German-speaking patients and wealthier local elderly, managed by former migrant care workers and international companies. Through in-depth ethnographic studies, investigations of care entrepreneurs and state insurances, and analysis of regional migration patterns, the project seeks to understand the implications of these new transnational welfare entanglements. \n\nBy addressing the question of what it means to age and require care in an interconnected Europe, this project will contribute to future discussions on care relocation as part of future-making and as a response to the privatization of care landscapes. Ultimately, the research aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of elderly care in a globalized world."
