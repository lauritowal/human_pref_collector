        "The grant proposal \"Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively\" seeks to explore the impact of emotional appeals on citizens' political choices and the increasing prevalence of emotional appeals by politicians. The project, named POLEMIC, will span from 1945 to present day and analyze data from 9 countries to test theories such as vote-maximizing strategy, politician personality, and fashionable trends. \n\nUsing automated text analysis and physiological measurement, the project will bridge the fields of party politics and political psychology to investigate both macro (politicians' messaging) and micro (citizens' responses) perspectives. The expected outcomes include a better understanding of the role of emotions in citizens' decision-making processes and the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals.\n\nPOLEMIC aims to extend existing theories and utilize innovative methods to elucidate the factors that determine the persuasiveness of emotional appeals in politics. By examining when emotional appeals are effective and when they are not, the project will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between emotions, politics, and decision-making. Ultimately, this research has the potential to inform political strategies and communication practices, contributing to a more informed and engaged citizenry.",
        "The proposed project, \"Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively\" (POLEMIC), aims to address key research questions surrounding the impact of emotional appeals on citizens' political choices and the increasing prevalence of emotional appeals by politicians. The project will span from 1945 to present day and analyze data from 9 countries to test multiple theories, including vote-maximizing strategy and the influence of politicians' personalities.\n\nUsing innovative methods such as automated text analysis and physiological measurements, POLEMIC will investigate both macro (politicians' messaging) and micro (citizens' responses) perspectives, bridging the fields of party politics and political psychology. By exploring the importance of emotion in citizens' decision-making and the rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals, the project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of emotions in politics.\n\nThe expected outcomes of POLEMIC include uncovering when emotional appeals are persuasive and when emotional attachments hinder persuasion. By extending existing theory and utilizing novel research methods, this project seeks to shed light on the complex interplay between emotions, political messaging, and citizen behavior. Ultimately, the findings from POLEMIC have the potential to inform political strategies and communication tactics in the future.",
        "The \"Politics and Emotions Investigated Comparatively\" grant proposal, known as POLEMIC, aims to delve into the impact of emotional appeals on citizens' political choices. This project will span from the year 1945 to the present, analyzing data from 9 different countries. By exploring questions such as the prevalence of emotional appeals by politicians and the reasons behind this trend, POLEMIC seeks to test theories such as vote-maximizing strategy, the influence of politicians' personalities, and the role of fashionable trends.\n\nUtilizing automated text analysis and physiological measurements, this project will bridge the fields of party politics and political psychology. By examining both macro (politicians' rhetoric) and micro (citizens' responses) perspectives, POLEMIC aims to shed light on the importance of emotions in decision-making processes. Furthermore, the project will investigate the level of rationality behind politicians' emotional appeals.\n\nOverall, POLEMIC will contribute to existing knowledge by providing insights into the effectiveness of emotional appeals in shaping political choices. By employing innovative methods and a comparative approach, this project will offer valuable findings on the persuasive power of emotions in politics."
