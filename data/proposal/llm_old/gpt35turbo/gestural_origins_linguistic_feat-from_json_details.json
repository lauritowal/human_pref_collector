        "The \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication\" grant proposal seeks to delve into the systematic meaningful communication present in great ape gestures and its implications for understanding the development of human language. The project aims to achieve this through three main objectives: exploring cultural variations in ape gestures, investigating the impact of combining signals on gesture meaning, and comparing human-ape gesture usage and comprehension.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, the research will involve comprehensive data collection across 17 ape and 9 human groups in Africa. The study will focus on species-specific, environmental, and social factors influencing gesture acquisition and use. Additionally, the project will analyze how signal combination shapes the construction of meaning in ape communication and compare gesture utilization and comprehension between humans and apes.\n\nThis study holds significant implications for our understanding of human language evolution by examining core language features like social learning and syntactic structure within the context of ape communication. By shedding light on the linguistic capabilities of our closest animal relatives, this research has the potential to provide valuable insights into the origins and development of language in humans. Ultimately, this project has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes that have shaped human communication.",
        "The grant proposal, titled \"Gestural Origins: Linguistic Features of pan-African Ape Communication,\" aims to investigate the systematic meaningful communication in great ape gestures and its significance for understanding the evolution of human language. The project will examine cultural variation in ape gesture across species, physical environments, and social interactions, as well as determine if combining signals alters the meaning of gestures in apes and analyze the construction of meaning. Additionally, the research will study human-ape gesture comparison in both use and comprehension among adults and children.\n\nThe methods of the project include pan-African data collection across 17 ape and 9 human groups, the study of species-specific, environmental, and social factors in gesture acquisition and use, analysis of signal combination and the construction of meaning in ape communication, and comparison of gesture use and comprehension between humans and apes.\n\nThis research is significant as it addresses the fundamental question of human language evolution and explores core language features such as social learning and syntactic structure in the context of ape communication. By shedding light on the origins and development of meaningful communication in apes, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the evolution of human language and cognition.",
