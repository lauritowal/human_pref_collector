        "The proposed project, \"Dynamics in Buddhist Networks in Eastern Central Asia, 6th-14th Centuries,\" aims to develop a novel framework for comprehending the dynamics of cultural encounter and religious transfer in pre-modern Eastern Central Asia. Focused on Buddhism, this project will explore key elements such as cultural encounter, religious transfer, and Buddhist localisations. By employing a trans-regional and trans-cultural vision, the research will reconstruct Buddhist networks in the region using methodologies from philology, art history, archaeology, and religious studies.\n\nOne of the unique perspectives of this project is the analysis of religious exchange as a dynamic network in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The multi-layered relationships between various cultural groups such as Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Khotanese, Uyghur, Tangut, and Kitan will be examined to understand the intricate interplay within the Buddhist networks.\n\nThrough investigating Buddhist localisations in Eastern Central Asia from the 6th to the 14th century, this project seeks to integrate Eastern Central Asian Buddhism into Comparative Religious Studies. By shedding light on the complex dynamics of religious transmission and localization, this research has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the historical development of Buddhism in the region.",
