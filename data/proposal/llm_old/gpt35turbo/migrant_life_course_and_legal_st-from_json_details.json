        "The \"Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition\" project aims to investigate the timing and impact of citizenship on migrant integration, taking into account how policy variations influence legal status transitions and integration outcomes. The objectives of the project include modeling migrants' legal status transitions as life course events, analyzing the relevance of citizenship for various aspects such as work, income, living conditions, health status, out-migration, and educational attainment, developing methodologies to analyze step-to-citizenship trajectories and policy impact, testing models using longitudinal and survey-based micro-data in 8 European and North American countries, and informing targeted citizenship policies to maximize settlement success. The target population for this study includes immigrants and their children. The project will utilize longitudinal register-based micro-data and survey-based micro-data as data sources. By shedding light on the relationship between citizenship, legal status transitions, and integration outcomes, this project has the potential to inform more effective and targeted citizenship policies that can enhance the settlement success of migrants in diverse contexts.",
