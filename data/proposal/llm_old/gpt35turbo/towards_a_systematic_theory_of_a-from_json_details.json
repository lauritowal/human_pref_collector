        "The \"Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry\" project, proposed under the title STARTDIALOG, aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams to address the lack of understanding of their logical properties and unappreciated heuristic potential. This project will have wide-ranging applications in philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. The research strategy involves creating a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and building a comprehensive diagram database.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include clarifying and solving current issues related to Aristotelian diagrams, gaining an accurate understanding of their methodological importance, and studying the diagrams as objects of independent interest. The impact of this project is expected to be a breakthrough in logical geometry, with relevance for philosophical logicians and applications in various disciplines.\n\nBy establishing a systematic theory of Aristotelian diagrams, this project will contribute significantly to the fields of logic and philosophy. The comprehensive database created as part of this project will serve as a valuable resource for researchers across disciplines. Overall, this project has the potential to advance knowledge in logical geometry and have a lasting impact on the study of Aristotelian diagrams.",

        "The proposed project, \"Towards a Systematic Theory of Aristotelian Diagrams in Logical Geometry\" (STARTDIALOG), aims to develop a unified theory of Aristotelian diagrams to address the lack of understanding of their logical properties and unappreciated heuristic potential. This project is interdisciplinary, with applications in philosophy, logic, psychology, linguistics, and computer science.\n\nThe research strategy involves creating a systematic typology of Aristotelian diagrams and building a comprehensive diagram database. The expected outcomes of this project include clarifying and solving current issues related to Aristotelian diagrams, gaining an accurate understanding of their methodological importance, and studying diagrams as objects of independent interest.\n\nIf successful, this project has the potential to be a breakthrough in logical geometry and will be relevant for philosophical logicians. Furthermore, the applications of this research extend to various disciplines, making it a valuable contribution to the academic community.\n\nBy providing a systematic theory of Aristotelian diagrams, the STARTDIALOG project will not only advance our understanding of logical geometry but also open up new avenues for research and applications in multiple fields."
