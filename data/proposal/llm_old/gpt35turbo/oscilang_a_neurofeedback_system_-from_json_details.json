    "descriptions": [
        "This grant proposal seeks funding for the development of OsciLang, a neurofeedback system designed to diagnose and improve language and reading impairments, specifically targeting dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI). The goal of this project is to create an affordable, lightweight, wearable brain-computer-interface neurofeedback system that can synchronize the brain's activity with changes in speech signals. The innovation lies in utilizing neurofeedback based on phase coherence of neural oscillatory activity with speech, supported by research showing reduced auditory tracking in the delta band in dyslexic readers.\n\nThe proposed system will diagnose and measure language disorders while also improving and rehabilitating them. By enhancing brain-speech tracking capabilities, the expected outcome is the improved literacy skills of individuals with dyslexia. The system will operate effectively in noisy environments and provide real-time quantification of basic parameters of brain activity via EEG. Users will benefit from the ability to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Monitoring parameters will focus on phase coherence at theta and delta bands. Additionally, the potential extension of this project includes providing a framework and technology for enhancing reading abilities. Funding for this project will support the development and implementation of OsciLang, ultimately making a significant impact on individuals with language and reading impairments.",

This technology will not only benefit users by facilitating top-down control on specific activation patterns, but also operate effectively in noisy environments. Ultimately, the OsciLang system has the potential to serve as a framework for enhancing reading abilities, making it a valuable tool for both diagnosis and rehabilitation of language disorders.",
