        "The \"Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work\" grant proposal, also known as CRAFTWORK, is a multi-methodological, pan-European study that focuses on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers in various sectors within the EU. The project aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the relationship between identity and work, with a particular emphasis on subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media.\n\nThis project is innovative in its approach, being the first comprehensive inquiry into 'neo-craft' work in the EU. It combines digital methods and qualitative research to rethink interpretative categories for the study of identity and work. The CRAFTWORK project addresses the challenges posed by the future of work, aiming to contribute to critical studies of new forms of work and their impact on society.\n\nOverall, the CRAFTWORK project seeks to shed light on the evolving nature of work in the context of identity, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in the field.",
        "The \"Craft work: Understanding the relationship between identity and work in the context of the future of work\" grant proposal, also known as CRAFTWORK, is a multi-methodological, pan-European study focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers in various sectors within the EU. The project aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding the relationship between identity and work. \n\nKey research areas of the project include subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media. The project will contribute to critical studies of new forms of work, addressing challenges related to the future of work. \n\nThe project's innovations lie in its empirical approach, being the first comprehensive inquiry on 'neo-craft' work in the EU, its methodological approach combining digital methods and qualitative research, and its theoretical contribution by rethinking interpretative categories for identity and work studies.\n\nThrough this project, we aim to shed light on the evolving landscape of work in the context of identity, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners navigating the future of work.",
        "The CRAFTWORK project seeks to investigate the intricate relationship between identity and work in the evolving landscape of the future of work. Through a multi-methodological, pan-European study focusing on the lived experiences, cultures, and practices of neo-craft workers across various sectors in the EU, this project aims to develop a new interpretative framework for understanding this relationship.\n\nBy delving into key research areas such as subjectivities, pathways to work, class location perception, cultural conceptions of social status, urban-rural distribution, and the role of social media, CRAFTWORK will offer valuable insights into the dynamics of identity formation within the context of contemporary work environments. This project will also introduce innovative empirical, methodological, and theoretical approaches, including the use of digital methods and a combination of qualitative research techniques.\n\nAs we face the challenges posed by the future of work, the findings from the CRAFTWORK project have the potential to inform policy-making, organizational practices, and societal perceptions of work and identity. By shedding light on the experiences of neo-craft workers and rethinking current interpretative categories, this project aims to contribute significantly to critical studies of new forms of work and their implications for individuals and societies."
