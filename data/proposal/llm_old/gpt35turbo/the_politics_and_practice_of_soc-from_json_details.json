        "The grant proposal \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\" seeks funding for a 5-year project aimed at extending Internet reach to remote regions, particularly in non-urban areas, to study the impact of social media on peace-building and violence perpetuation. The project will focus on Africa, specifically Eastern Africa, and conflict-affected communities. The key puzzle to be addressed is the role of social media in influencing conflict dynamics. Research questions will explore how social media alters transnational dimensions of conflict, the use of social media by public authorities to either encourage violence or promote peace, and how social media is changing people's experiences with violent conflict.\n\nThe project will examine dangerous speech online, the entry and exit of individuals from conflict, tactics used by actors to shape the Internet, and the governance actors' use of social media. The overarching goal is to better understand the interplay between social media and conflict in Africa, with a focus on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa. By shedding light on these complex dynamics, the project aims to inform policies and interventions that leverage social media for peacebuilding efforts in conflict-affected regions.",
        "The grant proposal titled \"The Politics and Practice of Social Media in Conflict\" seeks funding for a 5-year project focused on extending Internet reach to remote regions, particularly in Africa, with a specific emphasis on conflict-affected communities in Eastern Africa. The project aims to investigate the impact of social media access on peace-building versus perpetuating violence in regions with weak state governance and protracted violent conflict. The key puzzle to be addressed is understanding how social media alters transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding, how public authorities use social media to influence violence or promote peace, and how social media is changing individuals' experiences with violent conflict. The project will examine dangerous speech online, the exit and entry of individuals from conflict zones, tactics used by various actors to shape the Internet, and the use of social media by governance actors. The ultimate goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between social media and conflict in Africa, particularly in Eastern Africa, with a focus on religious and political violence. This research will contribute valuable insights to the field of peacebuilding and conflict resolution in the region.",
        "This grant proposal seeks to investigate the impact of social media on conflict dynamics in Africa, with a specific focus on Eastern Africa. Over a duration of 5 years, the project aims to extend Internet reach to remote regions in order to study the use of social media in perpetuating or mitigating violence in conflict-affected communities. The key puzzle to be addressed is the role of social media access in either peace-building or exacerbating violence. The research will explore how social media alters transnational dimensions of conflict, how public authorities use social media to influence violence or peace, and how individuals' experiences with violent conflict are changing due to social media. The project will analyze dangerous speech online, the movement of individuals in and out of conflict zones, tactics used by various actors to shape the Internet, and the use of social media by governance actors. By examining the interplay between social media and conflict in Africa, particularly in regions with weak state institutions and protracted violent conflicts, this research aims to contribute valuable insights to the fields of peacebuilding and conflict resolution."
