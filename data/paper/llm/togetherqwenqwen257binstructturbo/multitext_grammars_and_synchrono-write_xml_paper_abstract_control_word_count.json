        "Abstract:\nThis paper introduces and elaborates on Multitext Grammars (MTGs), a formalism designed to model translational equivalence between texts of multiple languages. MTGs extend traditional context-free grammars by incorporating a set of production rules that can generate multitexts, where each text is associated with a specific language. A key feature of MTGs is their ability to handle empty components, which represent elements that vanish in the translation process, introduced through special terminals and nonterminals. The paper defines the structure of MTGs, including their production rules and the ranking system, and explores the language they can generate. It also discusses bilexical MTGs, which incorporate lexical information, a crucial aspect for disambiguation in syntactic structure. The authors then delve into synchronous parsing algorithms for MTGs, presenting parsers like R2D2A and B, which are capable of inferring the syntactic structure and correspondence relations between component texts. The complexity analysis of these parsers highlights the importance of binarization schemes in determining time and space complexity. The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of MTGs for practical applications and future research directions, including the exploration of discontinuous and phrasal terminals, and the empirical study of MTGs through induction from real multitexts."

In MTG applications, the different components of a link will typically come from largely disjoint subsets of T or N, representing vocabularies or sets of grammatical categories from different languages.</S>\n    <S sid=\"113\" ssid=\"6\">Each MTG also has a set of production rules (or just &amp;quot;productions&amp;quot; for short), which fall into one of two categories.'</S>\n    <S sid=\"114\" ssid=\"7\">YIELD productions have the form where M is a non-empty vector of nonterminal links, P is a non-empty vector of D permutations, and N (&amp;quot;join&amp;quot;) is a rendering function, explained below.2 The rank of an MTG production is the number of nonterminal links on its RHS.</S>\n    <S sid=\"115\" ssid=\"8\">The rank of an MTG is the maximum rank of its production rules.</S>\n    <S sid=\"116\" ssid=\"9\">MTG(R) is the class of MTGs of rank R. Each row of P and M corresponds to a different component of multitext.</S>\n    <S sid=\"117\" ssid=\"10\">Each permutation is written as a row in P, and each link is written as a column in M, as in Equation 3 below.</S>\n    <S sid=\"118\" ssid=\"11\">If Xd is empty, then the dth component of every link in M must be empty too.</S>\n    <S sid=\"119\" ssid=\"12\">If Xd is not empty, then at least one of the links in M must have a non-empty dth component.</S>\n    <S sid=\"120\" ssid=\"13\">The position of a non-empty terminal or nonterminal relative to other non-empty elements of its component is its role.</S>\n    <S sid=\"121\" ssid=\"14\">If there are m non-empty nonterminals in component (row) d of M then Pd is a permutation of roles from 1 to Tn.</S>\n    <S sid=\"122\" ssid=\"15\">Pd is empty if and only if Xd is empty.</S>\n    <S sid=\"123\" ssid=\"16\">The D-MTG derivation process begins with the start link $, which is a vector of D copies of the special start symbol $ E N. The derivation continues with nondeterministic application of production rules.</S>\n    <S sid=\"124\" ssid=\"17\">The semantics of = are the usual semantics of rewriting systems, i.e., that the expression on the LHS can be rewritten as the expression on the RHS.</S>\n    <S sid=\"125\" ssid=\"18\">Following convention, we let be the reflexive and transitive closure of When no more productions can be applied, i.e., when all nonterminals have been rewritten into terminals, the rendering functions are evaluated in inside-out order.</S>\n    <S sid=\"126\" ssid=\"19\">The N function rearranges the nonempty terminals in each row of a link vector according to that row's permutation.</S>\n    <S sid=\"127\" ssid=\"20\">For example, [1,2,3] (c ab c abc N [1,3,2,4] wyxcz =wxyz [3,2,1] t Env c vut By reordering the terminals independently in each component, the join operator hides information about which terminals were derived from the same link.</S>\n    <S sid=\"128\" ssid=\"21\">Thus, the translational equivalence represented by links is not observable in MTG yields, just as it is not observable in raw multitext.</S>\n    <S sid=\"129\" ssid=\"22\">To avoid spurious ambiguity, we stipulate a normal form for components of P: In each permutation, the first appearance of role x must precede the first appearance of role y for all x &lt; y, except where the arrangement is incompatible with a preceding permutation in P. We could, for example, obtain the same result above if we put EZE first, put ewt last, and switch their roles in the 2nd and 3rd permutations.</S>\n    <S sid=\"130\" ssid=\"23\">However, the normal form requires the 2nd permutation to be [1, 3, 2, 4], not [4, 3, 2, 1], so EZE must be listed last.</S>\n    <S sid=\"131\" ssid=\"24\">Let Q be an MTG derivation where no more production rules can be applied.</S>\n    <S sid=\"132\" ssid=\"25\">Let Render(Q) be the result of evaluating all the N's in Q.</S>\n    <S sid=\"133\" ssid=\"26\">The (formal) language L(G) of an MTG G is the set of multitexts that can be generated by applying z to the start link of G and then evaluating all the joins.</S>\n    <S sid=\"134\" ssid=\"27\">I.e., L(G) = {Render(Q) : $ z Q}.</S>\n    <S sid=\"135\" ssid=\"28\">Due to the importance of lexical information in disambiguating syntactic structure, we shall pay special attention to lexicalized MTGs (LMTGs) of the bilexical variety (L2MTGs).</S>\n    <S sid=\"136\" ssid=\"29\">A bilexical MTG has a set A of &amp;quot;delexicalized&amp;quot; nonterminal labels.</S>\n    <S sid=\"137\" ssid=\"30\">Intuitively, A corresponds to the nonterminal set of an ordinary CFG.</S>\n    <S sid=\"138\" ssid=\"31\">Then, every nonterminal in N has the form L[t] for some terminal t E T and some label L E A.3 The terminal t is the lexical head of its constituent, or just the head.</S>\n    <S sid=\"139\" ssid=\"32\">One link on the RHS of each L2MTG production serves as the heir of the link on the LHS.</S>\n    <S sid=\"140\" ssid=\"33\">Each component of the heir link inherits the lexical head of its parent nonterminal.</S>\n    <S sid=\"141\" ssid=\"34\">An example of a 2-L2MTG derivation is in Figure 1.</S>\n    <S sid=\"142\" ssid=\"35\">Some subclasses and superclasses of MTG have been studied before.</S>\n    <S sid=\"143\" ssid=\"36\">The non-lexicalized class 2-MTG(2) is equivalent to ITG (Wu, 1997).</S>\n    <S sid=\"144\" ssid=\"37\">Alshawi et al.

Since D &lt; C(G), it turns out that the worst-case running time of Parser B is less than that of Parser A by a factor of nD under L2MTGs of any rank and dimensionality.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"6 Conclusion\" number=\"4\">\n    <S sid=\"206\" ssid=\"1\">We have proposed Multitext Grammars (MTGs) as a convenient and relatively expressive foundation for building practical models of translational equivalence.</S>\n    <S sid=\"207\" ssid=\"2\">To encourage their use for this purpose, we have explored algorithms for parsing bilexical MTGs of arbitrary rank and dimensionality.</S>\n    <S sid=\"208\" ssid=\"3\">Our exploration highlighted some little-known properties of synchronous parsing: (1) some optimizations of monolingual parsers generalize to the synchronous case, but others do not; (2) discontinuous constituents are essential for parsing bitexts even in similar Western languages; (3) different binarization schemes lead to different time and space complexity.</S>\n    <S sid=\"209\" ssid=\"4\">There are many aspects of translational equivalence that MTG cannot express, such as some of those described by Dorr (1994).</S>\n    <S sid=\"210\" ssid=\"5\">In future work, we hope to extend the formalism to cover some of the aspects that would not raise the computational complexity of its recognition, such as discontinuous and/or phrasal terminals.</S>\n    <S sid=\"211\" ssid=\"6\">Concurrently, we shall explore the empirical properties of MTG, by inducing stochastic MTGs from real multitexts.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"Acknowledgments\" number=\"5\">\n    <S sid=\"212\" ssid=\"1\">Thanks to Jason Eisner, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Owen Rambow, Giorgio Satta, and members of NYU's Proteus Project for helpful discussions.</S>\n    <S sid=\"213\" ssid=\"2\">The idea of treating binarization as an optimization problem is due to Wei Wang.</S>\n    <S sid=\"214\" ssid=\"3\">Dan Klein proposed the term &amp;quot;hook.&amp;quot; This research was supported by the DARPA TIDES program, by an NSF CAREER award, and by a gift from Sun Microsystems.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n</PAPER>"
