        "\"Cursed\" is a 2004 American supernatural horror film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, the duo known for their work on the \"Scream\" series. The movie blends elements of horror with a touch of dark comedy, taking a modern twist on the classic werewolf legend.\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\nThe story unfolds in Los Angeles where siblings Ellie (played by Christina Ricci) and Jimmy (played by Jesse Eisenberg) live a relatively normal life. Ellie is a hard-working professional with a job at a popular talk show, while her younger brother Jimmy is a high school student dealing with the usual teen issues, including bullying and unrequited love.\n\nOne fateful night, their lives take a dramatic turn when they are involved in a car accident on Mulholland Drive. While trying to help the other car's victim, they are attacked by a savage creature. Although they survive, the incident leaves them with strange wounds and a set of bizarre symptoms that they cannot explain.\n\nAs days pass, Ellie and Jimmy start to notice changes in themselvesâ€”enhanced senses, physical abilities, and an unexplainable attraction to the full moon. They come to the terrifying realization that they were attacked by a werewolf and are now cursed themselves. The curse is not only transforming them physically but also unleashing their primal instincts.\n\nDetermined to find a way to break the curse, Ellie and Jimmy delve into the dark underworld of Los Angeles, a city filled with various characters who could potentially be the werewolf that bit them. They learn that the only way to free themselves from the curse is to kill the one who started it all, the original werewolf. The siblings are thrust into a deadly race against time to find the source of their curse before the next full moon when they will be forced to succumb to their newfound lycanthropic nature.\n\nThroughout their journey, they encounter a colorful cast of characters, including a mysterious psychic who provides cryptic advice, a self-absorbed publicist who becomes entangled in the supernatural chaos, and a love interest for Ellie who may have secrets of his own. As the siblings get closer to the truth, they must contend with the werewolf's other victims, who have become threats themselves.\n\nEllie and Jimmy's relationship as brother and sister is tested as they struggle to protect each other and maintain their humanity. The bond they share becomes their greatest strength as they face the curse's challenges together. The film builds to a climactic showdown where Ellie and Jimmy face off against the werewolf in a life-or-death battle.\n\nThe movie concludes with the curse being broken, but not without losses and lessons learned. Ellie and Jimmy emerge from their ordeal with a new appreciation for life and the uncanny world that exists in the shadows of their city, forever changed by their experience.\n\n\"Cursed\" pays homage to classic werewolf films while offering a contemporary spin on the genre. It combines suspense, humor, and horror to explore themes of family, identity, and the battle between one's inner demons and humanity."
