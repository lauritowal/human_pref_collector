        "\"Tangled\" is a 2010 animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. The film is a reimagining of the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Rapunzel.\" It tells the story of a young girl with magical long hair who has spent her entire life locked away in a secluded tower.\n\nThe film opens with a drop of sunlight falling to earth and sprouting a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and injured. An old woman named Mother Gothel discovers the flower and uses its powers to keep herself young for hundreds of years. However, when the queen of the nearby kingdom becomes gravely ill during pregnancy, the flower is harvested to create a healing potion, which saves the queen's life and the life of her newborn daughter, Rapunzel.\n\nThe power of the flower is transferred to Rapunzel's hair, giving it magical properties. Mother Gothel kidnaps the baby Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower, using Rapunzel's magical hair to stay young. Rapunzel grows up believing Mother Gothel is her mother and is unaware of her royal lineage. Her only friends are Pascal, a chameleon, and her imagination. She dreams of seeing the outside world, especially the floating lanterns that are released by the kingdom every year on her birthday, not knowing they are a tribute from her parents who are still searching for her.\n\nOn the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel expresses her desire to leave the tower and see the lanterns up close. Mother Gothel refuses, telling her the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, a charming thief named Flynn Rider steals the crown of the lost princess from the castle and, while on the run, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower. He climbs up to hide, but Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan and hides him in a closet.\n\nStriking a deal with Flynn, Rapunzel convinces him to guide her to see the lanterns in exchange for the stolen crown. Reluctantly, Flynn agrees, and they embark on an adventure that includes a stop at the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with a group of ruffians and thugs who, surprisingly, have dreams of their own. The unlikely pair evade capture by Mother Gothel and the kingdom's guards, leading to various escapades and the blossoming of a romantic relationship between Rapunzel and Flynn.\n\nAs they spend time together, Flynn reveals his true identity as Eugene Fitzherbert, an orphan who took on the persona of Flynn Rider to create a more exciting life for himself. Rapunzel, in turn, shows him the genuine warmth and affection he has been missing in his life. Their bond deepens, and Rapunzel starts to realize her own strength and independence.\n\nThe climax of the film occurs when Mother Gothel's deception is uncovered, leading to a dramatic confrontation. Gothel tries to force Rapunzel back to the tower and fatally stabs Eugene when he tries to intervene. As Eugene lies dying, he cuts off Rapunzel's hair, which loses its magic and turns brown. With the magic gone, Mother Gothel rapidly ages and turns to dust.\n\nWith his last bit of strength, Eugene confesses his love for Rapunzel. As she weeps over him, a single tear, still imbued with the magic of the sun, falls onto his cheek and miraculously heals him. Reunited with her birth parents, Rapunzel finally returns to her rightful place as the princess of the kingdom. The film concludes with Rapunzel and Eugene living happily ever after, as he narrates the ending and playfully hints that they eventually marry.\n\n\"Tangled\" is celebrated for its vibrant animation, memorable characters, and catchy songs composed by Alan Menken. The film revitalized the classic Disney princess story for a new generation, blending traditional fairy tale elements with a contemporary twist. It was well-received by audiences and critics alike for its humor, heart, and the strong, independent character of Rapunzel, who breaks free from her confines to discover her true identity and destiny."
