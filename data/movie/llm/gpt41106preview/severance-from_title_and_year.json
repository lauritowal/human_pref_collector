        "\"Severance\" (2006) is a British horror-comedy film directed by Christopher Smith. The story revolves around a group of co-workers from the sales division of an international arms corporation, Palisade Defence. As a team-building exercise, they are sent on a weekend retreat to a remote lodge in the forests of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe team is composed of a mix of personalities, including the laid-back and friendly Steve, the ambitious and assertive Jill, the sarcastic and cynical Harris, the meek and nerdy Gordon, and their boss Richard, who is overly enthusiastic about the company and the retreat. They are accompanied by a few other employees, such as the resourceful Maggie and the easy-going Billy.\n\nUpon arrival, they find that the lodge they were supposed to stay in is old and decrepit, a far cry from the luxury resort they were promised. They decide to make the best of the situation, trying to engage in team-building activities and attempting to enjoy their time in the wilderness.\n\nHowever, the group quickly realizes they are not alone in the forest. They start finding ominous signs, such as freshly dug graves and old traps around the lodge. As night falls, the employees become the targets of a group of unknown assailants. These attackers are later revealed to be war veterans with a vendetta against the company, due to the faulty weapons sold to them by Palisade Defence, which led to their disfigurement and the death of their comrades.\n\nThe story takes a dark turn as the employees are hunted down one by one in a series of gruesome and often darkly comedic encounters. The team members must use their wits and the very weapons that their company sells to defend themselves against the relentless attackers. As they struggle to survive, alliances are formed, and the true nature of each character is revealed.\n\nThe film blends sharp satire with slasher-film tropes, commenting on corporate culture, the arms trade, and the impact of the military-industrial complex. \"Severance\" delivers suspense, gore, and laughs as it builds to a climactic showdown, with a few surviving characters uncovering the full extent of the conspiracy and fighting back against their would-be killers.\n\nThe film received praise for its clever script, tight pacing, and the balance of horror and comedy elements. With its unique blend of genres and biting social commentary, \"Severance\" became a cult favorite among fans of both horror movies and dark comedies."
