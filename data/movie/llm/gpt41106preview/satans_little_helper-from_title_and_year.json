        "\"Satan's Little Helper\" is a dark comedy horror film directed by Jeff Lieberman and released in 2005. The story revolves around a young boy named Douglas Whooly, who is obsessed with a video game called \"Satan's Little Helper.\" In the game, the player assists the character of Satan in carrying out various evil deeds.\n\nAs Halloween approaches, Douglas, who is enamored with the idea of the devil and his mischief, decides he wants to become Satan's Little Helper in real life. He dons a costume resembling his favorite video game character and sets out to find the devil, whom he believes is real and wandering the streets on Halloween.\n\nDouglas's life takes a surreal and dangerous turn when he encounters a masked man dressed as Satan. The man is actually a psychopathic serial killer who has been terrorizing the neighborhood, using Halloween as a cover for his gruesome activities. Douglas, naive and unaware of the man's true nature, is thrilled to meet his idol and eagerly offers to assist him, mistaking the killer's actions for harmless Halloween pranks.\n\nInnocently believing the man to be the real Satan, Douglas unwittingly becomes an accomplice, helping him set up what he thinks are fake scenes of horror. As the killer commits his crimes, Douglas is blissfully unaware of the reality of the situation. Meanwhile, Douglas's older sister, Jenna, and her boyfriend, Alex, become concerned about Douglas's strange behavior and his new \"friend.\" They begin to investigate and soon uncover the truth about the man in the Satan costume.\n\nJenna and Alex race against time to save Douglas from the killer's manipulative grip as they piece together the man's identity and his plans for the night. The film builds tension as Jenna becomes the killer's new target, with Douglas still in the dark about the killer's true intentions.\n\nAs the night unfolds, Douglas is confronted with the harsh truth that not all games are innocent and that his actions have real consequences. The film takes a critical look at the impact of violent video games on young minds and the blurred lines between fantasy and reality for impressionable children.\n\n\"Satan's Little Helper\" is filled with twists and turns, mixing elements of satire and horror to underscore the dangers of impressionability and the importance of distinguishing between make-believe and reality. The movie concludes with a chilling reminder of the real monsters that can hide behind masks and the innocence that can be exploited by true evil."
