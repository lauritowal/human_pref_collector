        "\"Tol'able David\" is a silent film from 1921 directed by Henry King, based on the short story by Joseph Hergesheimer. The film is set in rural West Virginia and is a coming-of-age story that has become a classic of the silent era, revered for its dramatic narrative and the emotional depth of its characters.\n\nThe plot centers around David Kinemon, a young and innocent boy from the Blue Ridge Mountains, who is referred to as \"tol'able\" (tolerable) by his family and neighbors because he hasn't yet proved himself as a man. He dreams of one day becoming a mail carrier like his older brother, but his gentle nature and lack of experience keep him on the sidelines.\n\nDavid's life takes a dramatic turn when three villains, the Hatburn brothers, come to town. They're notorious for their violent and criminal behavior. When they ambush and seriously injure David's older brother, who is the mail carrier, David's family is thrown into despair. With his brother unable to work, David must take on the responsibility of the mail route to support his family.\n\nFaced with the treacherous task of delivering mail on a route that runs through the Hatburns' territory, David must muster all his courage and determination. He faces numerous challenges and dangers on his journey, including encounters with the Hatburns, who continue to terrorize the community.\n\nDavid's resolve is put to the ultimate test when the Hatburns commit an atrocious act that deeply affects him and his family. Driven by a newfound strength and a desire for justice, David stands up to the villains in a dramatic confrontation. Through his bravery, he not only protects his loved ones but also earns the respect of his community.\n\nIn the end, David's journey from a \"tol'able\" boy to a courageous young man reflects the universal theme of growth and the transition from youth to adulthood. His actions demonstrate that true heroism comes from within and that even the most ordinary person can rise to extraordinary occasions.\n\n\"Tol'able David\" is celebrated for its powerful storytelling, strong performances, especially by Richard Barthelmess who played David, and its portrayal of rural American life. The film's influence is seen in the development of the coming-of-age genre and its portrayal of heroism in the face of adversity."
