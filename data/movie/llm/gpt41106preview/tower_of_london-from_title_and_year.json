        "\"Tower of London\" is a historical drama with elements of horror, directed by Roger Corman, released in 1962. The film is a loose adaptation of the life of Richard III of England and combines the historical account with macabre fiction, akin to Shakespeare's portrayal of the notorious king.\n\nThe plot centers around the ambitious and ruthless Richard, Duke of Gloucester, played by Vincent Price, who is determined to ascend to the English throne. The film is set during the latter part of the Wars of the Roses, a series of dynastic conflicts for the throne of England between the rival houses of Lancaster and York.\n\nAs the story unfolds, King Edward IV is on the throne, but his health is failing. Richard is his loyal brother but secretly harbors a desire to become king himself. He is cold, calculating, and willing to commit any atrocity to achieve his goals. Richard begins his ascent to power by ensuring the death of his brother George, Duke of Clarence, who stands before him in the line of succession.\n\nAfter the death of King Edward IV, his young sons Edward V and Richard are next in line. However, Richard places the boys in the Tower of London, ostensibly for their protection. In reality, he declares them illegitimate on the pretext that their father had been betrothed to another woman before marrying their mother. This clears his path to the throne, but the young princes in the tower become a loose end that haunts Richard.\n\nRichard's ascent to the throne is marked by a series of gruesome murders as he eliminates all those who pose a threat or question his legitimacy. His actions are driven by both a lust for power and a deep-seated insecurity that manifests in horrific nightmares and hallucinations, possibly as a manifestation of his guilt.\n\nThroughout the film, Richard is haunted by the ghosts of his victims, including the princes, which drive him further into madness. These supernatural elements add to the film's horror atmosphere, depicting Richard as a man tormented by his own conscience and the specters of those he has wronged.\n\nAs Richard's paranoia and guilt reach a fever pitch, he faces rebellion from those nobles who have become disillusioned with his tyrannical rule. The climactic battle sees Richard's forces pitted against the army led by Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII. In the end, Richard's army is defeated, and he meets his demise on the battlefield, thus fulfilling the prophecies foretold by the ghosts that haunted him.\n\n\"Tower of London\" is notable for its blending of historical drama with the psychological horror elements that director Roger Corman and star Vincent Price were known for. Price's portrayal of Richard III is particularly memorable for its over-the-top theatricality and the chilling manner in which he conveys the character's descent into madness.\n\nThe film is not a strict recounting of historical events but rather a cinematic portrayal of the infamous king, drawing on the cultural legacy left by Shakespeare's play and other literary sources that have painted Richard III as a villainous, deformed usurper. It reflects the fascination of the time with gothic horror and the morbid intrigue surrounding one of England's most notorious monarchs."
