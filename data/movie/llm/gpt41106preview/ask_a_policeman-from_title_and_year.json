        "\"Ask a Policeman\" is a British comedy film released in 1939, directed by Marcel Varnel and featuring the popular comedy trio of the era known as The Crazy Gang. The film stars Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, and Jimmy Nervo, among others, as they engage in a series of humorous escapades.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nIn the sleepy village of Turnbotham Round, crime is virtually non-existent, a fact that has the local police force worried. The constabulary, consisting of Sergeant Dudfoot (played by Bud Flanagan), Constable Albert Brown (Chesney Allen), and Constable Harbottle (Jimmy Nervo), find themselves in a predicament as their lack of crime-fighting activity threatens their jobs. The authorities have warned that if there are no crimes to solve, the police station will be closed and the officers will be out of work.\n\nIn a comedic twist of fate, the bumbling trio hatch a plan to save their careers by fabricating a crime wave in Turnbotham Round. They secretly go about committing harmless misdemeanors, hoping that the resulting \"crime\" will be enough to justify their existence. The plan appears to be working initially as the villagers are taken in by the ruse, and the police revel in the attention and importance they now command.\n\nHowever, things quickly spiral out of control when the fake crimes lead to an unexpected real crime wave. The village, once a quiet and safe haven, is suddenly besieged by a series of bizarre and inexplicable thefts, the most puzzling of which involves the disappearance of road signs and milestones. The officers find themselves in over their heads as they struggle to solve the actual crimes they inadvertently inspired.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the film introduces a subplot involving the enigmatic 'Headless Horseman,' a local legend that is said to haunt the nearby moors. The officers, in their comical ineptitude, seek to solve the mystery of the ghostly apparitions as well as the thefts, believing that the two may be connected.\n\nAs Dudfoot, Brown, and Harbottle bumble their way through investigations, they encounter a series of quirky characters, including eccentric inventors and shady characters, all of whom add to the confusion and laughter. The trio's antics are filled with slapstick humor, misunderstandings, and clever wordplay, which were hallmarks of The Crazy Gang's comedic style.\n\nIn the climax of the film, the real culprits behind the crime wave are revealed to be a gang of smugglers who have been using the stolen road signs to confuse the police and direct their operations. The 'Headless Horseman' also turns out to be part of the smugglers' scheme to keep superstitious locals away from their activities. In a final comedic showdown, the policemen, with their characteristic luck and lack of grace, manage to capture the smugglers and save the day.\n\nThe film concludes with Sergeant Dudfoot and his constables celebrated as heroes, having unintentionally solved the crimes and saved their jobs. The village of Turnbotham Round returns to its peaceful state, and the officers are left to revel in their newfound respect within the community, promising to keep an eye out for any future mischief.\n\n\"Ask a Policeman\" is a delightful comedy that showcases the slapstick humor and quick wit of The Crazy Gang, providing audiences with light-hearted entertainment and a nostalgic glimpse into British humor of the late 1930s."
