        "\"When Were You Born\" is a 1938 mystery film that intertwines astrology with a murder investigation. The story follows Mei Lei Ming, an Asian astrologer portrayed by Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong. Mei Lei Ming uses her unique skills in astrology to assist in solving a baffling murder case.\n\nThe plot begins when a wealthy man is found dead aboard a ship. The police investigation initially follows traditional methods, but the case takes a turn when the ship's captain recalls that Mei Lei Ming, a passenger on the ship, had predicted that danger and death awaited someone born under a particular zodiac sign.\n\nIntrigued by this coincidence, the investigators decide to enlist Mei Lei Ming's help in their investigation. She believes that a person's birth date holds the key to their character and, possibly, their motive for murder. As the investigation unfolds, the astrologer delves into the birth dates of all the suspects on board, using her knowledge of astrology to determine who could have had the inclination to commit the crime.\n\nMei Lei Ming suggests that the position of the stars and planets at the time of each suspect's birth could reveal hidden truths about their personalities and motives. Her unconventional methods are met with skepticism by the police detectives, but as she begins to provide accurate descriptions and uncovers secret motives, they start to take her seriously.\n\nThe suspects, each born under different zodiac signs, display traits that might connect them to the murder. As Mei Lei Ming interacts with them, she uses her astrological insights to peel back the layers of their characters, revealing jealousy, greed, and other motives for the crime.\n\nThe film plays out as a series of interactions between Mei Lei Ming and the suspects, with the astrologer gradually eliminating individuals whose astrological signs suggest they would be unlikely to commit such a crime. Tension builds as she gets closer to identifying the real murderer, and the climax of the film is reached when Mei Lei Ming sets a trap to reveal the killer, using her knowledge of astrology and human nature.\n\n\"When Were You Born\" is a unique take on the murder mystery genre, blending Eastern mysticism with Western detective storytelling. It showcases Anna May Wong's talent at a time when Asian actors rarely played leading roles in Hollywood films. The film is also notable for its attempt to introduce astrology as a legitimate tool for crime-solving, catering to a period when audiences were fascinated by the exotic and the unknown.\n\nThe movie stands out for its cultural representation and is an early example of using astrology as a central theme in a narrative. While it may not be considered scientifically accurate by today's standards, \"When Were You Born\" offers an intriguing and entertaining story that reflects the era's curiosity about astrology and the influence of the stars on human destiny."
