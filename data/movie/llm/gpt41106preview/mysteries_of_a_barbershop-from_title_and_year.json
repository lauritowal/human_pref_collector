Set in the early 1920s, the film unfolds within the quirky confines of a small-town barbershop run by a whimsical barber named Mr. Schnipp. The barbershop serves as a gathering place for an eclectic mix of characters, each with their own peculiarities and secrets.\n\nOne day, a mysterious stranger arrives, setting off a series of comedic and bizarre events. The stranger is revealed to be a fugitive on the run, hiding a valuable secret.
