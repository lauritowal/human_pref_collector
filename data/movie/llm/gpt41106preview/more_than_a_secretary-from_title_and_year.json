        "\"More Than a Secretary\" is a romantic comedy film from 1936 that tells the story of Carol Baldwin (played by Jean Arthur), an intelligent and spirited young woman who works as a secretary at a health magazine. Despite her professional demeanor and efficient work ethic, Carol harbors a secret crush on her boss, Fred Gilbert (played by George Brent), the magazine's editor.\n\nFred is a fitness enthusiast who is oblivious to Carol's affections. He sees her solely as a competent secretary, not as a potential romantic partner. Carol, eager to capture his attention, decides to transform herself into the epitome of the health-conscious woman that Fred admires. She embarks on a rigorous exercise regime and healthful living makeover, and her new appearance and confidence begin to turn heads, including Fred's.\n\nAs Carol becomes more involved in the magazine's features and begins to contribute her own ideas, she becomes indispensable to Fred both professionally and personally. However, her transformation and newfound assertiveness lead to a series of comic misunderstandings and jealous mishaps when Fred believes she has fallen for another man.\n\nUltimately, through a series of humorous and endearing events, Fred comes to realize that Carol is not only an invaluable asset to his magazine but also the woman he loves. He learns to see beyond her role as a secretary and appreciate her for all her talents and virtues.\n\n\"More Than a Secretary\" is a light-hearted romp through the evolving roles of women in the workplace and the often-overlooked romantic sparks that can fly in the confines of office walls. With witty dialogue and charming chemistry between the leads, the film delivers a heartwarming message about recognizing the value and depth of individuals beyond their job titles."
