        "Title: Aayirathil Oruvan\nYear: 2008\n\nNote that there might be a confusion regarding the year as \"Aayirathil Oruvan\" is a Tamil-language film that was actually released in 2010, not 2008. The film is directed by Selvaraghavan and stars Karthi, Reemma Sen, Andrea Jeremiah, and Parthiban. Assuming we are referring to the same film that was released in 2010, here is a plot summary for \"Aayirathil Oruvan\":\n\n\"Aayirathil Oruvan\" is an adventurous and mystical journey that intertwines history with fantasy. The film opens with the introduction of the Chola dynasty, which is facing a severe threat from the Pandya dynasty. To escape the onslaught, the Chola king and his people flee to a secret location, taking with them the idol of their deity. Over time, the whereabouts of the Chola refugees become a mystery lost to the pages of history.\n\nCenturies later, in the present day, an archaeological team led by Professor Anitha (played by Andrea Jeremiah) sets out on an expedition to uncover the lost Chola civilization. The team includes the cool-headed officer Lavanya, the comic relief character Karupp, and the adventurous but brash protagonist, Muthu (played by Karthi), who is a skilled coolie hired to assist the team.\n\nThe group embarks on a treacherous journey through uncharted territories and dangerous waters, facing various hurdles such as tribal attacks and treacherous terrain. As they delve deeper into the jungle, they encounter a series of supernatural events and historical puzzles that they must solve to move forward. The team also comes across a group of people who have safeguarded the Chola culture for generations, living in seclusion and completely cut off from modern civilization.\n\nThe plot thickens when the expedition discovers that these people are the descendants of the original Chola refugees. They have been waiting for the rightful heir to their kingdom to return and lead them back to their former glory. The descendants, led by their charismatic and enigmatic leader (played by Parthiban), are initially hostile towards the outsiders, as they see them as a threat to their existence and the secrecy they have maintained for centuries.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Muthu finds himself at the center of this historical enigma, with the fate of the lost Chola kingdom and its people resting in his hands. He is faced with the challenge of bridging the gap between the past and the present, protecting the Chola descendants from modern-day threats, and helping them find their rightful place in the world.\n\nThe film combines action, drama, and romance, as relationships develop between the characters amidst the backdrop of this epic quest. As they journey through the trials and tribulations of their adventure, they learn about the power of unity, the importance of preserving one's heritage, and the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\n\"Aayirathil Oruvan\" is a cinematic experience that blends historical fiction with fantasy elements, taking the audience on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and leaving them with a thought-provoking message about the significance of history and the enduring spirit of culture and identity."
