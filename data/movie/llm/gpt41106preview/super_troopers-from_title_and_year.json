        "\"Super Troopers\" is a 2001 comedy film directed by Jay Chandrasekhar and written by and starring the comedy group Broken Lizard, which is composed of Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske. The film is known for its irreverent humor, slapstick comedy, and unique take on law enforcement.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Spurbury, Vermont, the plot revolves around a group of five Vermont state troopers who are more interested in having a good time than in doing their jobs. The troopers, Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske), Mac (Steve Lemme), Foster (Paul Soter), and the heavyset and boisterous Farva (Kevin Heffernan), are notorious for their pranks, juvenile antics, and a penchant for pulling over motorists just to amuse themselves with unconventional police work.\n\nThe troopers are under the command of the affable but ineffectual Captain O'Hagan (Brian Cox), who struggles to keep his team in line while facing the threat of having his station shut down due to budget cuts. The main plot kicks off when the troopers discover a murder victim with a stash of marijuana and attempt to solve the crime to prove their worth and save their jobs.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the investigation, the troopers find themselves in a rivalry with the local Spurbury Police Department, led by the arrogant Chief Grady (Daniel von Bargen), who also aims to solve the case and take credit for the bust. The tension between the two law enforcement groups leads to a series of hilarious confrontations and pranks.\n\nThe troopers' methods are unorthodox, to say the least, with their investigation tactics including outrageous stunts, such as posing as highway patrolmen to mess with truck drivers, and creating diversions to sneak into the local police station. Along the way, Foster develops a romantic interest in a local police officer named Ursula (Marisa Coughlan), which adds a dose of romantic comedy to the mix.\n\nEventually, the troopers uncover a drug smuggling operation with connections to the Spurbury Police Department, and they must work together to take down the corrupt officers and bring the criminals to justice.\n\n\"Super Troopers\" is characterized by its absurd and often slapstick humor, with memorable scenes including the troopers engaging in a syrup-chugging contest, using a bear costume in a sting operation, and the recurring joke of Farva's obsession with a fast-food restaurant called Dimpus Burger. The film also features a number of quotable lines and has become a cult classic, particularly among fans of stoner and comedy films.\n\nDespite its lowbrow humor and mixed critical reception upon release, \"Super Troopers\" has gained a devoted following and is celebrated for its offbeat characters, quotable dialogue, and commitment to farcical comedy. The film's success eventually led to a crowdfunded sequel, \"Super Troopers 2,\" released in 2018."
