The film revolves around the life of a young man named Prabhu, played by Dhanush, who resides in Chennai with his middle-class family.\n\nPrabhu is portrayed as a carefree and aimless youth who has failed his higher secondary exams and lacks direction in life. Dissatisfied with his mundane existence, he dreams of owning a Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle, which he believes will give him a sense of achievement and change his fortunes. Prabhu's father, a strict and honest government employee, disapproves of his son's indolent attitude and desires to see him take on responsibilities.\n\nAfter much persuasion, Prabhu's father agrees to co-sign a loan for the bike, and Prabhu's dream finally comes true. He becomes attached to his new possession, and it indeed begins to transform his life. He finds purpose and starts working in a private bank as a collection officer, which brings him a sense of fulfillment and responsibility. During this time, he also falls in love with a girl named Hema, played by Divya Spandana, who resides in his neighborhood.\n\nHowever, Prabhu's life takes a dramatic turn when his beloved bike is stolen. Consumed by his attachment to the bike and the personal significance it holds, Prabhu embarks on a quest to retrieve it. His search leads him into the dark underbelly of the city, where he encounters the brutal realities of urban crime. Prabhu crosses paths with a ruthless gang involved in bike theft and other criminal activities, led by the main antagonist Selvam, played by Kishore.\n\nAs he delves deeper into the criminal network, Prabhu's actions inadvertently drag him into a violent conflict with the gangsters. The situation escalates, and what started as a mission to reclaim his bike becomes a fight for survival and justice. Prabhu's character transforms from a naive and easy-going young man to someone who must confront and overcome the challenges posed by the dangerous criminals he faces.\n\nThe narrative of \"Polladhavan\" is laced with themes of revenge, the significance of personal belongings, the impact of urban crime on ordinary lives, and the journey of a protagonist from innocence to a hardened resolve to stand up against wrongdoing.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim for Dhanush's performance, the direction, the realistic portrayal of Chennai's streets, and the engaging screenplay. \"Polladhavan\" was a commercial success and is regarded as one of the important movies in Dhanush's career, marking his growth as an actor and establishing him in the Tamil film industry.
