        "\"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\" is a 2002 martial arts comedy film written, directed by, and starring Steve Oedekerk. The movie is a parody of the martial arts genre and is known for its unique style of humor, which involves a blend of slapstick, absurdity, and purposely over-the-top dubbing and editing. Oedekerk used footage from the 1970s Hong Kong martial arts film \"Tiger & Crane Fists\" (also known as \"Savage Killers\"), along with new scenes that he himself shot, to create an intentionally disjointed and hilarious narrative.\n\nThe plot revolves around a character named \"The Chosen One,\" played by Oedekerk, who has a unique birthmark in the shape of a triangle on his tongue. As a child, his family is killed by the villainous Master Pain, who later renames himself \"Betty.\" The Chosen One narrowly escapes with his life and is raised by various rodents in the wilderness, which parody the trope of heroes being raised by animals in classic martial arts films.\n\nAs he grows up, The Chosen One becomes a skilled martial artist, obsessed with avenging his family's death. He discovers that to achieve his goal, he must confront and defeat the powerful and evil Betty. Along his journey, The Chosen One encounters various eccentric characters, including a cow trained in martial arts, a martial arts school filled with students who are inept at fighting, and a woman with one breast who may be a potential love interest or ally.\n\nThe Chosen One also meets Master Tang, a dying kung fu master who becomes his mentor. Master Tang has a number of comical ailments and a tendency to cough up large amounts of blood, often at inappropriate times. Despite his weaknesses, Master Tang tries to impart wisdom to The Chosen One, including the secret of the Iron Claw technique, which Betty is rumored to be vulnerable against.\n\nThroughout the film, The Chosen One encounters numerous henchmen and faces ridiculous challenges, each of which parodies typical scenes found in martial arts movies, such as training montages and one-on-one duels with quirky opponents. The dialogue is intentionally out of sync with the characters' mouth movements, paying homage to poorly dubbed martial arts films of the past.\n\nIn the climax of the movie, The Chosen One finally confronts Betty in a showdown. After a series of over-the-top battles involving improbable stunts and bizarre visual effects, The Chosen One manages to use the Iron Claw technique to defeat Betty and avenge his family. However, the victory is short-lived as new villains appear on the horizon, setting up a potential sequel.\n\n\"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\" satirizes the clich√©s and tropes of traditional kung fu movies, using absurd humor and anachronistic jokes to entertain the audience. While the film received mixed reviews from critics, it has garnered a cult following due to its unique style and comedic approach to the martial arts genre."
