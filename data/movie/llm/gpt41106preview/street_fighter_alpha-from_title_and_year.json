        "\"Street Fighter Alpha,\" released in 2000, is an animated film that delves into the origins and early years of several characters from the popular Street Fighter video game series. The movie is inspired by \"Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams,\" which is part of the Street Fighter franchise, and focuses on character development and backstories rather than a single, overarching conflict.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nThe film opens with a young Ryu, haunted by the mysterious and troubling death of his master, Gouken. Plagued by the fear that the dark energy within him, known as the Satsui no Hado, might one day overwhelm him, Ryu seeks a way to control or rid himself of it. His journey leads him to different corners of the globe, where he encounters various fighters, each with their own reasons for battling.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken Masters, Ryu's best friend and sparring partner from their days training under Gouken, is struggling with his own purpose and direction in life. The wealthy heir to the Masters' fortune, Ken feels unsatisfied with his easy lifestyle and yearns for a challenge that could rekindle the fiery spirit of his younger days.\n\nThe two friends' paths cross when they decide to enter an underground martial arts tournament organized by the enigmatic and powerful fighter, Akuma. Akuma is rumored to have mastered the most dangerous aspect of the martial arts â€“ the same dark energy that Ryu fears within himself. The tournament attracts a diverse array of fighters, including the disciplined Chun-Li, who is seeking to avenge her father's death, which she believes is connected to the tournament's shadowy sponsors.\n\nAnother key figure is Charlie Nash, a U.S. Air Force officer investigating the criminal organization Shadaloo, led by the sinister M. Bison. Bison has his own interest in the tournament, seeing it as a means to identify and recruit strong fighters to serve as his enforcers. He is particularly intrigued by Ryu's potential and seeks to lure him to his side.\n\nAs the tournament progresses, the fighters each face personal challenges and confrontations that test their limits and reveal deeper layers of their characters. Ryu battles with the temptation of the Satsui no Hado, and Ken learns to balance his competitive spirit with the responsibilities and relationships he's neglected. Chun-Li confronts her past and gains closure, while Charlie gets closer to uncovering Shadaloo's true intentions.\n\nThe climax of the film sees Ryu confronting Akuma in a fierce battle. Akuma recognizes the same dark energy within Ryu and attempts to push him over the edge, to fully embrace the Satsui no Hado and become an unstoppable force of destruction. However, with the support of Ken and the other fighters, Ryu manages to resist the temptation and defeats Akuma without succumbing to the darkness.\n\nThe film concludes with the characters going their separate ways, each having grown from their experiences. Ryu continues his journey as a wandering warrior, seeking to perfect his art and control the Satsui no Hado. Ken returns to his life with a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to both his fighting and his personal life. Chun-Li and Charlie carry on their fight against corruption and injustice, now with a better understanding of the enemies they face.\n\n\"Street Fighter Alpha\" provides a deep dive into the motivations and struggles of its characters, setting the stage for their future encounters and battles in the Street Fighter universe. The movie is a blend of martial arts action and character-driven storytelling, appealing to fans of the video game series and newcomers alike who appreciate a good tale of personal growth and epic combat."
