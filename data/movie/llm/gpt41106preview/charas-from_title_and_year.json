When his plane crashes in a remote area, he is presumed dead. However, Suraj survives and sets out to clear his name. He embarks on a journey to find the real culprits behind the drug trafficking operation that he's been framed for.\n\nSuraj's quest leads him to cross paths with a beautiful woman named Sunita (Hema Malini), who is on her own secret mission.
