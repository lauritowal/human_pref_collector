        "\"Girl, Interrupted\" is a 1999 drama film directed by James Mangold, based on Susanna Kaysen's 1993 memoir of the same name. The film chronicles the experiences of an 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, portrayed by Winona Ryder, who is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and voluntarily commits herself to a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt and an episode of what she believed was exhaustion, but doctors suggested was an attempt to chase a \"bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka.\"\n\nSet in the late 1960s, the film captures Susanna's struggle with her mental health, her relationships with other patients, and her resistance to the era's psychiatric methods. Upon arrival at the Claymoore Hospital, she is introduced to a ward of young women, each dealing with their own psychological issues. Among them is the charismatic, manipulative sociopath Lisa Rowe, played by Angelina Jolie in an Academy Award-winning performance. Lisa has a profound influence on Susanna, as her rebellious and defiant nature both entices and terrifies her.\n\nThe narrative follows Susanna as she navigates the complexities of her new environment, finding solace in the friendships she forms with other patients, including the troubled Lisa, the childlike Daisy Randone, played by Brittany Murphy, and the burn victim Polly 'Torch' Clark, played by Elisabeth Moss. Through her interactions with these women, Susanna gains insight into her own condition, the nature of her illness, and the broader issues facing women in the 1960s, such as societal expectations, personal freedom, and the stigmatization of mental illness.\n\nAs Susanna witnesses the varying degrees of treatment and responses from the hospital staff, including the compassionate nurse Valerie, played by Whoopi Goldberg, and the stern psychiatrist Dr. Wick, played by Vanessa Redgrave, she begins to question the path to healing and what it means to be \"normal.\" The film explores themes of rebellion, conformity, and the fine line between sanity and insanity.\n\nThroughout the film, Susanna's personal journey is marked by self-discovery, as she reflects on her life and the events that led to her hospitalization. Her relationship with Lisa is a focal point, as Lisa's influence leads Susanna into trouble but also confronts her with the reality of her situation. After a series of dramatic incidents, including an escape from the hospital and a devastating tragedy, Susanna is forced to make a decision about her future and whether she is ready to face the world outside of Claymoore's walls.\n\n\"Girl, Interrupted\" is a poignant and thought-provoking film that delves into the personal experiences of those living with mental illness and the journey toward understanding and recovery. It presents a raw and unflinching look at life inside a psychiatric hospital while also offering a critique of the mental health care system of the time. The film's title, \"Girl, Interrupted,\" alludes to the interruption of Susanna's life by her stay in the hospital and her mental illness, as well as the broader interruption of the lives of young women who deviated from societal norms during the period."
