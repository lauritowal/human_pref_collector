        "\"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\" is the third film in the \"Children of the Corn\" series, which is based on the short story by Stephen King. Released in 1995, this sequel takes a departure from the rural setting of the previous films and brings the horror to an urban environment.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nThe story follows two young brothers, Eli and Joshua, who are orphaned after the mysterious death of their father in Gatlin, Nebraska â€“ the original location of the \"Children of the Corn\" cult. They are adopted by a couple, William and Amanda Porter, who live in Chicago. The Porters are unaware that Eli is a fervent follower of \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\" the malevolent entity worshiped by the children's cult.\n\nEli, the younger brother, is portrayed as a sinister and manipulative child with a dark secret. Upon arriving in Chicago, he brings with him a couple of corn seeds from Gatlin that hold the essence of the evil entity. He plants these seeds in an abandoned lot next to the apartment building where they live, and the corn swiftly grows at an unnatural pace, thriving amidst the concrete and steel of the urban landscape.\n\nAs Eli enrolls in a local school, his strange behavior and preaching begin to influence the other children. He preaches about the purity of the land and the need to rid the world of adult corruption, slowly gathering a following among his peers. Joshua, on the other hand, tries to fit into the new environment and is more skeptical of Eli's intentions, becoming increasingly concerned about his brother's activities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Porters have their own issues. William, a successful businessman, sees an opportunity to exploit the rapidly growing corn for profit, unaware of its sinister nature. Amanda, however, grows worried about Eli's influence on her family and the community, noticing the disturbing changes in the children who come into contact with him.\n\nAs the corn grows taller, bizarre incidents and violent occurrences start to happen around the neighborhood. People who oppose or threaten Eli meet gruesome fates, and it becomes apparent that the cornfield is a conduit for \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\" allowing the entity to extend its reach into the city.\n\nTensions reach a breaking point when the entity's power grows strong enough to begin influencing events more directly. Eli initiates a new harvest ceremony, aiming to sacrifice adults and non-believers to appease the entity. Joshua, now fully aware of the evil his brother is channeling, must find a way to stop Eli and prevent the entity from consuming the city in its malevolent grip.\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, Joshua and a group of survivors face off against Eli and his followers in the midst of the urban cornfield. The battle is not just for their lives, but for the soul of the city itself. To break the entity's hold, they must destroy the cornfield and Eli, who has become the embodiment of \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows.\"\n\n\"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\" taps into the fear of malevolent forces invading the everyday spaces of urban life. It uses the setting change to explore themes of environmental corruption, the loss of innocence, and the dangers of blind faith. The film ends with a resolution to the immediate threat, but like many horror films, it leaves open the possibility of the evil's return, sowing seeds of unease that stay with the viewer long after the credits roll."
