        "\"By Dawn's Early Light\" is a 1990 HBO television film directed by Jack Sholder. The movie is a post-apocalyptic thriller based on the novel \"Trinity's Child\" by William Prochnau. The story unfolds in the midst of a nuclear crisis, offering a chilling portrayal of how close humanity can come to the brink of annihilation.\n\nThe film is set during the height of the Cold War when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union are at their peak. The plot is triggered when an unknown party launches a nuclear attack on Soviet cities, which is mistakenly interpreted by the Soviets as an aggressive act by the United States. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launches its own missiles towards the United States, setting off a chain reaction that threatens to escalate into full-scale nuclear war.\n\nThe central character, Major Cassidy, played by Powers Boothe, is a U.S. Air Force bomber pilot who is caught in the midst of the unfolding chaos. Cassidy and his co-pilot, Lieutenant Moreau (Rebecca De Mornay), are airborne in a B-52 bomber when they receive the order to execute their grim mission: a retaliatory nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. As they grapple with the morality of their orders and the potential consequences, they must also contend with the possibility that the initial order may have been based on a tragic misunderstanding.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground, the U.S. President, played by Martin Landau, and his advisors, including the hawkish and manipulative National Security Advisor, played by Rip Torn, scramble to make sense of the situation and prevent the crisis from escalating further. The President must navigate through a minefield of conflicting advice, misinformation, and the inherent challenges of the chain of command in the face of an unprecedented emergency.\n\nAdding to the tension is the presence of a group of military officials, including a commander of the Strategic Air Command, General Renning, portrayed by Darren McGavin, who may have their own agendas and perspectives on the unfolding crisis.\n\nAs the events of the film unfold, the characters are faced with the moral and ethical dilemmas of nuclear warfare. They must make life-and-death decisions with incomplete information, under the pressure of a ticking clock that could lead to the end of civilization as they know it.\n\n\"By Dawn's Early Light\" is a tense and fast-paced drama that delves into the fears and realities of nuclear conflict. The film explores themes of responsibility, trust, and the potential for human error to lead to catastrophic consequences. It serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of peace and the importance of communication and understanding in international relations.\n\nThe movie was well-received for its gripping narrative, strong performances, and its thought-provoking examination of the psychological and political complexities of the nuclear age. It remains a potent reminder of the ever-present danger posed by nuclear weapons and the thin line between peace and global catastrophe."
