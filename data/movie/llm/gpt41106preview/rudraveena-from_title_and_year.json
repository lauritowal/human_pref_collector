His ideas clash with his father's traditional beliefs, leading to conflict between the two.\n\nDespite the opposition from his father, Suryam continues to work for the betterment of the underprivileged and fights against the caste system. He falls in love with Lalitha, played by Shobana, a woman from a lower caste. This relationship further fuels the fire between Suryam and his father.\n\nThe film's climax involves Suryam organizing a grand music concert to promote social harmony and equality. He must overcome the prejudices of society and his father's disapproval to succeed in his mission.\n\n\"Rudraveena\" is a thought-provoking film that combines a compelling narrative with a powerful social message, emphasizing the importance of empathy, equality, and the unifying force of music."
