        "\"Less Than Zero\" is a 1987 drama film directed by Marek Kanievska, based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. The movie captures the dark side of the 1980s excess through the story of three affluent, disenchanted teenagers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe plot centers around Clay Easton (played by Andrew McCarthy), a college freshman returning home to L.A. for Christmas. He finds that his ex-girlfriend, Blair (Jami Gertz), and his best friend, Julian (Robert Downey Jr.), have developed severe cocaine addictions. Julian, once a promising young entrepreneur, has dropped out of school, and his life has spiraled out of control due to his drug dependency. He is deeply in debt to his supplier, Rip (James Spader), and is forced into prostitution to pay off his debt.\n\nClay's return exposes the trio's strained relationships and the hollow lifestyle that they lead. Blair struggles with her feelings for Clay and her inability to quit drugs, while Clay attempts to help Julian overcome his addiction. The film explores themes of addiction, loss of innocence, and the moral emptiness of the wealthy youth subculture in the 1980s.\n\nAs Clay's efforts to save Julian become more desperate, the film takes viewers on a harrowing journey through the decadent and destructive world of L.A.'s party scene. The story ultimately serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excess and the human cost of drug addiction. \"Less Than Zero\" is a stark, stylistic depiction of a generation consumed by apathy and hedonism."
