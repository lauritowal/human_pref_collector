        "\"Table for Five\" is a 1983 drama film directed by Robert Lieberman. The story centers on J.P. Tannen (played by Jon Voight), a divorced, somewhat self-absorbed professional golfer who has largely been an absent father to his three children. The film explores themes of redemption, family, and the complexities of parental responsibilities.\n\nTannen, who has been estranged from his children, decides to take them on a Mediterranean cruise to try to reconnect and make up for lost time. His children, who have been living with their mother Kathleen (played by Millie Perkins) and stepfather Mitchell (played by Richard Crenna), are hesitant at first due to their father's history of neglect and unreliability.\n\nThe cruise serves as a backdrop for the unfolding drama as Tannen grapples with the challenges of parenthood. He is awkward and unfamiliar with the daily routines and emotional needs of his kids: Truman-Paul (Robby Kiger), a sensitive young boy; Tilde (Son Hoang Bui), who is of Vietnamese descent and was adopted; and Trung (Roxana Zal), the eldest daughter who remembers her father's failings all too well.\n\nAs they travel from port to port, Tannen's attempts to bond with his children start off rocky. He tries to buy their love and affection with gifts and excursions, but these superficial efforts often backfire. However, as the trip progresses, Tannen starts to learn more about his children and begins to understand what it means to be a father. The children, in turn, start to see past their father's flaws and appreciate his attempts to make amends.\n\nTheir fragile newfound relationship is put to the test when tragedy strikes. Kathleen dies unexpectedly, and Tannen must face the possibility of taking on a role he never expected: full-time fatherhood. This situation is complicated by the fact that Mitchell, who has been a stable and loving presence in the children's lives, also wants to keep the family together and is seeking custody.\n\nFacing the reality of his past negligence, Tannen realizes that he must fight for his children, not just in a legal sense but also by proving that he can be the parent they need. The film culminates in an emotional and legal struggle between Tannen and Mitchell, with the children's future hanging in the balance.\n\nUltimately, \"Table for Five\" is a poignant tale of personal growth and the lengths to which a parent will go for the love and trust of their children. It highlights the importance of second chances and the enduring bonds of family, even in the face of adversity and past mistakes."
