        "\"George of the Jungle\" is a 1997 family comedy film that serves as a live-action adaptation of the animated television series of the same name, which was inspired by the Tarzan stories. Directed by Sam Weisman, the movie features Brendan Fraser as George, the titular character, with Leslie Mann as Ursula Stanhope, and an animated gorilla named Ape voiced by John Cleese.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nDeep in the heart of the African jungle, a baby boy is the sole survivor of a plane crash. Found and raised by a wise, talking gorilla named Ape, the boy grows up to become George, a lovably clumsy but incredibly strong and good-hearted king of the jungle. George swings from vines, communicates with various jungle animals, and protects his jungle home from various threats with his sheer physical prowess, albeit with a penchant for crashing into trees.\n\nEnter Ursula Stanhope, a wealthy San Francisco heiress on an African safari adventure led by her conniving and snobbish fiancé, Lyle Van de Groot, played by Thomas Haden Church. Ursula, in search of something more from life than her sheltered existence, stumbles upon George after Lyle abandons her in the jungle. George saves Ursula from a lion attack in a comedic and heroic manner, and the two form an immediate bond.\n\nUrsula is captivated by George's innocence and connection to the jungle, while George is equally smitten with Ursula's kindness and beauty. However, their burgeoning romance is threatened by Lyle, who, along with his hired henchmen Max and Thor, intends to track down Ursula and bring her back to civilization – mostly for his own selfish reasons.\n\nAs George and Ursula's relationship develops, George saves Ursula from various jungle threats, including a menacing elephant and aggressive monkeys. Through these adventures, Ursula teaches George about the human world, while George shows her the wonders of the jungle. However, Ursula eventually realizes she must return to San Francisco to confront her responsibilities and her overbearing mother.\n\nLyle, who is determined to marry Ursula for her wealth, manages to capture George and have him shipped to the United States, presenting him as a jungle attraction. In the meantime, Lyle is arrested by local authorities for his illegal activities in the jungle.\n\nBack in the city, George experiences a culture shock and struggles to fit in with modern society, but his inherent goodness and love for Ursula keep him going. Ursula, realizing her love for George, breaks off her engagement with Lyle. She and her friend, Kwame, rescue George from his urban prison, and together they outwit Ursula's mother and Lyle, who has now escaped custody and is determined to force Ursula into marriage.\n\nThe film culminates in a madcap chase through the streets of San Francisco, with George using his jungle skills in the urban environment to save Ursula and defeat Lyle. In the end, George's heroism wins the day, and he and Ursula return to the jungle, where they are married in a ceremony attended by their animal friends and Ape.\n\n\"George of the Jungle\" is a light-hearted, family-oriented comedy that combines slapstick humor with a heartwarming story. The film's message centers around the importance of being true to oneself and the value of love over material wealth. With its humorous take on the fish-out-of-water trope and a classic tale of romance and adventure, \"George of the Jungle\" provides laughs and entertainment for viewers of all ages."
