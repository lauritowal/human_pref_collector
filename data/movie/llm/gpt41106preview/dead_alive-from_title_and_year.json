        "\"Dead Alive,\" also known as \"Braindead\" outside of North America, is a 1993 New Zealand splatstick comedy horror film directed by Peter Jackson. The film is known for its outrageous and graphic blend of horror and comedy, and has since become a cult classic.\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\nSet in the 1950s in the fictional Wellington suburb of Karori in New Zealand, the film revolves around the life of a meek and unassertive man named Lionel Cosgrove. Lionel lives with his domineering and overbearing mother, Vera. His life takes a turn when he falls in love with a local shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita. Paquita is convinced that Lionel is the man destined for her after a tarot card reading.\n\nTheir budding romance is immediately threatened by Vera, who does not approve of Paquita and is overly possessive of her adult son. One day, while spying on the couple at the zoo, Vera is bitten by a Sumatran Rat-Monkey, a hybrid creature that was captured on Skull Island (an homage to King Kong) and brought to the zoo. The bite turns her into a ravenous zombie after a grotesque and rapid degeneration.\n\nLionel, a devoted son, tries to keep his mother's condition a secret and takes care of her as she becomes increasingly undead, but Vera's zombie infection soon spreads. She manages to bite and infect others, including a nurse, a priest, and some locals. Lionel attempts to keep them under control by sedating them with animal tranquilizers and locking them in the basement.\n\nAs the situation spirals out of control, Lionel struggles to maintain the facade of normalcy. His relationship with Paquita is strained by the bizarre events unfolding in his home. Things come to a head during a house party thrown by Lionel's sleazy uncle Les, who has designs on inheriting the family home. The party is crashed by the group of zombies, leading to a night of gory and ludicrous mayhem.\n\nArmed with a lawnmower, Lionel takes on the growing horde of zombies in an over-the-top bloodbath, determined to save Paquita and the other guests. The lawnmower becomes an iconic image of the film, symbolizing the absurdity and excessiveness of the gore.\n\nThe climax of the film involves a grotesque confrontation with the zombified Vera, who has continued to mutate into a monstrous creature. In a Freudian twist, Lionel must confront and \"separate\" from his monstrous mother to survive and fully commit to his relationship with Paquita.\n\nThe film resolves with Lionel and Paquita managing to escape the carnage. They walk away from the wreckage hand-in-hand, suggesting that they have overcome the bizarre ordeal and are ready to face a future together.\n\n\"Dead Alive\" is celebrated for its inventive special effects, audacious gore, and irreverent humor. It showcases Peter Jackson's early filmmaking style, which combines horror with slapstick comedy, and served as a precursor to his later success with epic films like \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Despite its low budget, the film's creative prosthetics and puppetry have earned it a reputation as one of the goriest films of all time."
