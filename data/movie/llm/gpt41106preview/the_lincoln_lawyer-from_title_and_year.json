        "\"The Lincoln Lawyer\" is a 2011 legal thriller directed by Brad Furman and based on the novel of the same name by Michael Connelly. The film stars Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller, a slick, charismatic Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back seat of his Lincoln Continental sedan, hence the film's title.\n\nPlot Summary:\nMickey Haller is a defense lawyer who has built his career defending a clientele of prostitutes, drug dealers, and motorcycle gang members, often working out of his car. Haller is known for his ability to manipulate the legal system to his clients' advantage, but he is also struggling to find a moral balance and to repair his relationship with his ex-wife, Maggie McPherson (played by Marisa Tomei), and their daughter.\n\nHaller's life takes a dramatic turn when he is hired to defend a wealthy real estate agent, Louis Roulet (played by Ryan Phillippe), who has been accused of violently assaulting a prostitute. Roulet maintains his innocence, claiming that he has been set up, and presents a seemingly solid alibi. Despite the evidence against him, Haller believes Roulet and takes on the case, seeing it as a chance to elevate his career.\n\nAs Haller and his investigator, Frank Levin (played by William H. Macy), dig deeper into the case, they uncover disturbing details that suggest Roulet may be more dangerous than they initially thought. Haller's skills and ethics are put to the test as he navigates a series of twists and turns, trying to uncover the truth while also facing personal danger.\n\nHaller's investigation leads him to realize that Roulet may be connected to a previous case of his—a case in which Haller advised his client, Jesus Martinez (played by Michael Peña), to plead guilty to a murder he may not have committed. Haller begins to suspect that Roulet was the actual perpetrator in that murder, and that he has used his wealth and influence to set up others for his crimes.\n\nConsumed by guilt over the possibility that he helped convict an innocent man while setting a guilty one free, Haller desperately tries to piece together the evidence that will prove Roulet's guilt and exonerate Martinez. The situation becomes even more complicated when Levin is murdered, presumably by Roulet, to keep the truth from coming out.\n\nAs the film reaches its climax, Haller must outwit not only his cunning client but also the legal system he knows so well. He orchestrates a series of events to ensure that justice is served, risking his own life and career in the process. In a high-stakes courtroom showdown, Haller uses his wit and legal expertise to turn the tables on Roulet and ensure he pays for his crimes.\n\nThe movie concludes with Haller getting justice for Martinez, who is released from prison, and the implication that Haller may be ready to take a more ethical approach to his legal practice going forward. Despite the personal and professional challenges he's faced, Haller emerges as a more reflective man, contemplating the impact his actions have on the lives of others and the justice system as a whole.\n\n\"The Lincoln Lawyer\" is a gripping legal drama that offers a mix of suspense, courtroom intrigue, and complex characterization, anchored by a strong performance from Matthew McConaughey as the morally ambiguous yet ultimately redemptive Mickey Haller."
