        "\"The Gendarme in New York\" is a French comedy film released in 1965, directed by Jean Girault. It is the second installment in the popular \"Gendarme\" series, starring Louis de Funès as the gendarme Ludovic Cruchot. The film follows the misadventures of Cruchot and his fellow gendarmes from the small French village of Saint-Tropez as they travel to New York City.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nThe story begins when the gendarmes of Saint-Tropez are invited to represent France at an international police convention in New York City. Cruchot, thrilled by the prospect of such an adventure, leads his squad of hapless officers across the Atlantic. However, Cruchot's joy is dampened upon discovering that his daughter, Nicole, has stowed away on the ship to be with her boyfriend, who lives in New York.\n\nUpon arrival in the bustling metropolis, the gendarmes are instantly overwhelmed by the city's size, pace, and cultural differences. Cruchot, in particular, finds himself in a series of comedic predicaments as he tries to uphold French law and order amidst the chaos of New York. His attempts at policing range from the absurd, such as directing traffic in the middle of a busy intersection, to the comical, as he tries to communicate in his very limited English.\n\nWhile the gendarmes are busy exploring the city and attending the convention, Cruchot is also on a personal mission to find Nicole before she gets into trouble. His search leads him through various iconic New York locations, from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty, often resulting in hilarious misunderstandings and slapstick comedy.\n\nNicole, on the other hand, is having her own adventure in the city, blissfully unaware of her father's frantic search. She enjoys the sights and sounds of New York with her boyfriend, blissfully exploring what the city has to offer to young lovers.\n\nAs the convention continues, the gendarmes participate in various events and competitions, showcasing their unique, often unorthodox methods of policing. Their foreign approach to law enforcement amuses and bemuses the other international delegates, adding to the film's humor.\n\nCruchot's escapades in the city finally lead him to Nicole, and in true comedic fashion, the reunion is filled with both relief and reprimand. With his daughter safely in tow, Cruchot can finally relax and enjoy the rest of the convention, which is filled with more humorous events and cultural exchanges.\n\nThe film concludes with the gendarmes returning to Saint-Tropez, their trip to New York leaving them with unforgettable memories and stories to tell. Cruchot, ever the proud gendarme, has managed to survive the chaos of New York, save his daughter from potential mishaps, and bring a little bit of Saint-Tropez to the Big Apple.\n\n\"The Gendarme in New York\" combines the charm of its leading actor, Louis de Funès, with the fish-out-of-water trope to create a comedy that resonates with viewers through its lighthearted take on cultural differences and the universal theme of a father's love for his daughter. Its blend of physical comedy, situational humor, and character-driven antics made it a hit in its time and a fondly remembered entry in the \"Gendarme\" series."
