Rajnandini, or Raj, as she is affectionately called by her friends, is a bright and ambitious student who dreams of pursuing a career in the field of journalism.\n\nAs Raj prepares for her final exams, she finds herself torn between following her own dreams and living up to the expectations of her traditional and conservative family. Her parents, especially her mother, want her to pursue a more traditional career path and settle down with a suitable boy chosen by them. Despite their pressure, Raj remains determined to carve out her own path in life.\n\nOne day, Raj's life takes an unexpected turn when she meets a charming and charismatic boy named Vivan, who is a new student at her school.
