        "In \"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest,\" the story follows two brothers, Joshua and Eli, who are adopted after being found in a cornfield where their parents were killed. The boys are sent to live with a family in a city, away from the rural town where they were found. As they settle into their new home, strange occurrences begin to happen, with the boys being at the center of it all.\n\nEli, the younger brother, starts displaying strange behavior and an unusual fascination with corn. He begins to plant corn seeds all over the city, which quickly grow into a massive cornfield. At the same time, Joshua, the older brother, begins to notice that Eli's influence is changing the people around him. They become more aggressive and violent, following Eli's lead without question.\n\nAs the cornfield continues to grow, it becomes clear that Eli is being influenced by a dark and malevolent force. Joshua realizes that his brother is under the control of He Who Walks Behind the Rows, a demonic entity worshipped by the children in the original cornfield where they were found. He must find a way to stop Eli before the entity's influence spreads further.\n\nMeanwhile, the adults in the city start to notice the strange occurrences and violent behavior of the children. They try to intervene and stop the spread of chaos, but they are met with fierce resistance from the possessed children. As the situation escalates, Joshua teams up with a local girl, Maria, who believes in his cause and wants to help him stop Eli and the dark entity controlling him.\n\nJoshua and Maria discover that the only way to defeat He Who Walks Behind the Rows is to destroy the cornfield where it draws its power. They set out to find a way to stop Eli and confront the demon head-on. Along the way, they face numerous obstacles and challenges, including the possessed children who will stop at nothing to protect their new leader.\n\nIn a climactic showdown, Joshua and Maria confront Eli and the demon in the heart of the cornfield. Joshua must find the strength to face his brother and the evil entity controlling him, even if it means sacrificing everything he holds dear. With Maria's help and his own determination, Joshua manages to destroy the cornfield and banish the demon back to where it came from.\n\nIn the aftermath, the city is left in ruins, but the threat has been averted. Joshua and Maria emerge victorious, having saved the city from the dark forces that threatened to consume it. Eli, freed from the demon's influence, is left to face the consequences of his actions. Joshua and Maria part ways, forever changed by their harrowing experience but grateful for the bond they formed in the face of evil.\n\n\"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\" is a thrilling tale of supernatural horror, sibling rivalry, and the power of love and friendship to overcome even the darkest of forces."
