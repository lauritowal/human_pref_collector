The island appears deserted, with no signs of the rave that they were expecting to attend.\n\nAs they explore the island, they discover a house that seems to be the only building on the entire island. Curious, they decide to investigate further. Inside the house, they find evidence that people were once living there, but now it seems abandoned.\n\nSuddenly, they are attacked by a horde of zombies that come out of nowhere. Panicked, the group tries to defend themselves, but they are outnumbered and outmatched.

They must work together to come up with a plan to escape the island and make it back to safety.\n\nThroughout their ordeal, they uncover the dark secrets of the island and the mysterious experiments that were conducted there.
